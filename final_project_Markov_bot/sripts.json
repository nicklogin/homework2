Hey, Sam, let me borrow you for a couple easy throws, all right? Watch this, Charlie.<br> That wasn't so bad, was it? Now I'll throw him.<br> Here we go, Sam.<br> That looks hard.<br> Aw! Come on, Charlie.<br> Try it.<br> Attaboy.<br> Let's get over.<br> Oh! [Sam Laughs] That wasn't so bad, was it? Don't laugh at me.<br> Don't laugh at me!

No, I heard you.<br> Have Dr.<br> McCoy and Mr.<br> Spock meet me in the briefing room.<br> Thasians have been referred to in our records as having the power to transmute objects or render substances invisible.<br> It's generally been regarded as legend, but Charlie seems to possess this power.<br> What are chances Charlie's not an Earthling but a Thasian? No, I don't think so, unless they're exactly like Earthlings.<br> The development of his fingers and toes exactly matches present development of man.<br> Well, whatever he is, we've some idea of his power.<br> I know what I saw in the gymnasium.<br> Considering the effect normal adolescents have on a home, Charlie Short-tempered, because he doesn't understand.<br> He needs, he wants.<br> Nothing happens fast enough.<br> The probability is he's responsible for the destruction of the Antares, which indicates total disregard for human life.<br> He doesn't understand what life is.<br> He's a boy.<br> Well, what do we do with this boy, Jim? How do we keep him caged up? It goes even further, Doctor.<br> We can't take him to Earth Colony 5.<br> Imagine what he'd do in an open, normal environment.<br> I've talked with him, listened.<br> He's a boy in a man's body trying to be adult, adolescence getting in the way.<br> With a weapon in him, which could destroy you or anyone anywhere on this ship.<br> Well, for the moment he's stopped.<br> You're an authority he respects, Jim.<br> Agreed.<br> The struggle must remain between you and him.<br> Should any of us interfere You wanted to ask me something he said.<br> Are you responsible for what happened to the Antares, Charlie? Why? Answer me.<br> Yes.<br> There was a warped baffle-plate on their energy pile shield.<br> I made it go away.<br> It would've blown up anyway.<br> Well, they weren't nice to me! They wanted to get rid of me.<br> They don't now.<br> What about us, Charlie? I don't know.<br> We're in the hands of an adolescent.<br> Lieutenant, raise Colony 5.<br> I want to speak directly to the governor.<br> Navigator, lay a course away from Colony 5.<br> Buy me some time.<br> Aah! Spock, get the doctor up here on the double.<br> How bad is it? I think it's all right, sir.<br> There's no reason for that panel to cross-circuit like that.<br> I checked it over myself not 15 minutes ago.<br> Captain, I can't feed any course coordinates into the panel, sir.<br> It rejects the course change.<br> Helm doesn't respond either, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you getting any instrument readings? Yes, sir.<br> There's a-- ''Tiger, tiger, burning bright in the forest of the night.<br>'' Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm trying to-- ''Saturn rings around my head, down a road that's Martian red.<br>'' You're trying to change course, Captain.<br> You can't.<br> I want to get to Colony 5 as soon as we can.<br> Release the transmitter.<br> You don't need all that subspace chatter.<br> What's going on here? Spock calls me to the bridge and goes into some kind of poetry.<br> See to her, Doctor.<br> ''Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered, weak and weary'' Very nice, Mr.<br> Ears.<br> I can make him do anything-- whirl around, laugh, anything.<br> That's enough, Charlie.<br> Don't you think he's funny? I think he's funny.<br> Leave my crew alone.<br> Jim, he'll soon reach a point where he won't back down.<br> I know.<br> Charlie, what's wrong? I have something for you.<br> Pink is your favorite, isn't it? You don't walk into a room without knocking.<br> Don't ever lock your door on me again, Janice.<br> I love you.<br> I'll lock it when I please.<br> What is it you want, anyway? You.<br> I only want to be nice to you.<br> I can give you anything.<br> Just--Just tell me.<br> I want you to get out.<br> But I only want to be nice to you.<br> Get out, Charlie.<br> I can't make it any plainer than that.<br> I love you.<br> You don't know what the word means.<br> Then show me.<br> No! Charlie.<br> Why did she do that? I loved her, but she wasn't nice at all.<br> What you did wasn't nice either, but I still need you, Captain.<br> The Enterprise isn't quite like the Antares.<br> Running the Antares was easy.<br> You have to be nice.<br> All right? Mr.<br> Spock? My legs-- They're broken.<br> Let him go, too, Charlie.<br> Why? Because I'm telling you to.<br> You need me to run the ship, and I need him.<br> If you try to hurt me again, I'll make lots of people go away.<br> And what about Yeoman Janice? Is she dead? Gone? Destroyed? I won't tell you.<br> Growing up isn't so much.<br> I'm not a man, and I can do anything! You can't.<br> I'll activate the force field myself.<br> You can return to your section.<br> He had a mean look.<br> I had to freeze him.<br> I like happy looks.<br> Aren't you coming in? That wasn't nice.<br> You'll be sorry.<br> You wait.<br> You'll see.<br> You'll be sorry you did that.<br> You will.<br> Aah! [Laughing] No.<br> No laughing! [Silent] Aah! Aah! Aah! [Moaning] Captain Kirk my instruments show we're receiving a message on subspace frequency 3, ship-to-ship.<br> I can't hear it, sir.<br> You're creating that message, Charlie, or you're blocking one that's coming in.<br> It's my game, Captain.<br> You have to find out.<br> Like you said, that's how the game's played.<br> You can have it now.<br> I've locked on course for Colony 5 again.<br> I've waited long enough.<br> I'm going to take him on.<br> You don't have any special immunity.<br> Not anymore.<br> Push far enough, he'd send you to oblivion, too.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? Out of the question.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Does Charlie Now, wait Spock, has he done away with anybody since he took over? Not so far as we know.<br> Then maybe he can't.<br> Could be he's overreached himself.<br> It's a big ship.<br> He's taken full control.<br> If we could tax his power-- turn on every device on the ship, every circuit, every light, all of it-- and while he's fighting that, if I could distract him, maybe you could tranquilize him, keep him under, until we reach Colony 5.<br> Risky, Jim.<br> If we don't try, Doctor, he'll get rid of us anyway.<br> There's no choice, gentlemen, none at all.<br> I can make you all go away anytime I want to.<br> Get out of my chair and get out now.<br> I've got your ship, Captain.<br> Maybe, Charlie, but I don't think you can handle any more.<br> I think you've reached your limit and can't take on one more thing.<br> But you're going to have to.<br> I could've sent you away before, but I didn't.<br> You're going to have to take me on.<br> Don't make me do it.<br> You've got my ship, and I want it back.<br> I want my crew back whole, if I have to break your neck to do it! Don't push me.<br> Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah.<br> Sorry.<br> I'm sorry but Aah! [Receiver Crackles] Stop that.<br> I said stop it! Captain, the navigation console is clear now.<br> The ship is answering the helm.<br> Sir, something off our starboard bow.<br> The message says they're from Thasus.<br> Oh.<br> Captain, how did l-- It's all right, Yeoman.<br> Sensors show something's there.<br> Deflectors indicate no solid substance.<br> No! Oh, no, please don't let them take me.<br> I can't live with them anymore! You're my friends.<br> You said you were my friends.<br> Remember? When I came aboard! Please I want to go home.<br> Take me home.<br> I have taken my form centuries ago, so that I may communicate with you.<br> We did not realize until too late that the boy had gone.<br> We are saddened that his escape cost the lives of the first ship.<br> We could not help them, but we have returned your people and your ship to you.<br> Everything is as it was.<br> Oh, I won't do it again.<br> Please, I'll be good.<br> I won't ever do it again.<br> I'm sorry about the Antares.<br> I'm sorry! When I came aboard! Please? I want to go with you.<br> Help me! The boy belongs with his own kind.<br> That would be impossible.<br> We can teach him to live in our society.<br> If he can be taught not to use his power We gave him power so he could live.<br> He will use it always, and he would destroy you and your kind, or you would be forced to destroy him to save yourselves.<br> Is there nothing you can do? We offer him life, and we will take care of him.<br> Come, Charles.<br> Oh, please Don't let them take me.<br> I can't even touch them! Janice They can't feel.<br> Not like you! They don't love! Please I want to stay stay stay stay stay stay stay.<br> [Uhura] Charlie's back on board the Thasian ship, sir.<br> They signaled they're leaving.<br> It's all right, Yeoman.<br> It's all over now.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain's log, Star date 1312.<br>4.<br> The impossible has happened.<br> From directly ahead, we're picking up a recorded distress signal, the call letters of a vessel which has been missing for over two centuries.<br> Did another Earth ship once probe out of the galaxy as we intend to do? What happened to it out there? Is this some warning they've left behind? Your move, Captain.<br> We should have intercepted by now.<br> The bridge said they'd call.<br> I'll have you checkmated your next move.<br> Have I ever mentioned you play a very irritating game of chess, Mr.<br> Spock? Irritating? Ah, yes.<br> One of your Earth emotions.<br> Certain you don't know what irritation is? The fact one of my ancestors married a human female-- Terrible having bad blood like that.<br> [Whistle Blows] Bridge to briefing lounge.<br> Object is now within tractor beam range.<br> No visual contact, Mr.<br> Kelso? No, sir.<br> It's too small to be a vessel.<br> It reads about Not large enough even for a lifeboat.<br> Small enough to bring it aboard, sir.<br> lf you want to risk it.<br> Lock onto it, Mr.<br> Kelso.<br> Materializer ready, sir.<br> Bring it aboard.<br> Old-style ship recorder that could be ejected when something threatened the ship.<br> More like destroyed the ship, in this case.<br> Look at it.<br> Burnt, pitted.<br> Let's hope its tapes are intact.<br> - We'll feed it through Mr.<br> Spock's computer.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Flash the bridge! Put all decks on the alert! [Siren] [Siren Continues] Hold it, Jim.<br> Getting into shape? Yeah.<br> I figured you weren't on the bridge.<br> Kelso's voice sounded a little nervous.<br> Well, uh, you finish the game? Mmm.<br> He played most illogically.<br> His next move should have been the rook.<br> You're relieved, Mr.<br> Alden.<br> Acknowledged, Mr.<br> Mitchell.<br> Screen on.<br> Screen on, sir.<br> [Beeping] Approaching galaxy edge, sir.<br> Neutralize warp, Mr.<br> Mitchell.<br> Hold this position.<br> Neutralize warp, sir.<br> Address intercraft.<br> Intercraft open.<br> This is the captain speaking.<br> The object we encountered is a ship's disaster recorder, apparently ejected from the S.<br>S.<br> Valiant 200 years ago.<br> The tapes are burnt out.<br> Trying the memory banks.<br> We hope to learn from the recorder what the Valiant was doing here and what destroyed the vessel.<br> We'll move out into our probe as soon as we have those answers.<br> All decks, stand by.<br> Department heads.<br> You wanted everybody on the bridge before we left the galaxy.<br> Jones.<br> The name's Smith, sir.<br> Astro sciences standing by, Captain.<br> Engineering division ready, as always.<br> Life sciences ready, sir.<br> This is Dr.<br> Dehner, who joined the ship at the Aldebaran colony.<br> Psychiatry, Captain.<br> My assignment is to study crew reaction in emergency conditions.<br> Getting something from the recorder now.<br> lf there was an emergency, I'd be interested in how that crew reacted, too.<br> Improving the breed, Doctor? Is that your line? I heard that's more your specialty, Commander, line included.<br> Walking freezer unit.<br> Decoding memory banks.<br> I'll try to interpolate.<br> The Valiant had encountered a magnetic space storm and was being swept in this direction.<br> The old impulse engines weren't strong enough.<br> Swept past this point, about 1/2 light-year out of the galaxy, they were thrown clear, turned, and headed back into the galaxy here.<br> I'm not getting it all.<br> The tapes are pretty badly burned.<br> Sounds like the ship had encountered some unknown force.<br> Now, orders counter orders repeated urgent requests for information from the ship's computer records for anything concerning ESP in human beings.<br> Extrasensory perception? Dr.<br> Dehner, how are you on ESP? In tests I've taken, my ESP rated high.<br> I'm asking what you know about ESP.<br> It is a fact that some people can sense future happenings, read the backs of playing cards, and so on, but the esper capacity is always quite limited.<br> Severe damage.<br> Seven crewmen dead.<br> [Beeping] No, make that six.<br> One crewman seemed to have recovered.<br> That's when they became interested in extrasensory perception.<br> More than interested, almost frantic about it.<br> [Distortion] No, this must be garbled.<br> I get something about destruct.<br> I must have read it wrong.<br> It sounded like the captain giving an order to destroy his own ship.<br> Comments? The only fact we have for sure is that the S.<br>S.<br> Valiant was destroyed.<br> That's probably the best argument to continue the probe.<br> Other vessels will be heading out here someday and they'll have to know what they'll be facing.<br> We're leaving the galaxy, Mr.<br> Mitchell.<br> Ahead, warp factor 1.<br> [Beep] Force field of some kind.<br> We're coming up on it fast.<br> Sensor beam on.<br> Sensor beam on, sir.<br> Deflectors full intensity.<br> Deflectors full intensity.<br> Deflectors say there's something there, sensors say there isn't.<br> Density negative.<br> Radiation negative.<br> Energy negative.<br> Whatever it is, contact in 12 seconds.<br> Gravitation on automatic.<br> Emergency stations.<br> All decks on fire alert.<br> Neutralize controls.<br> Kelso, put it on manual.<br> Any radiation? Anything? Negative! Helmsmen, take us out of here! Helmsmen! Lateral power! Take damage reports.<br> Damage control reports, all stations! Gravity control switching to batteries.<br> Something, uh hit me, like an electrical charge.<br> He's alive.<br> Appears to be in shock.<br> Engineering deck 3, can you give damage report? Sensor beams.<br> Full power on the deflectors.<br> Main engines are out, sir.<br> We're on emergency power cells.<br> Casualties, nine dead.<br> Gravity is down to .<br>8.<br> All decks, this is bridge engineering.<br> Due to emergency conditions Gary Gary, are you all right? I'm a little weak for some reason, Jim, But I feel all right now.<br> Captain's log, Star date 1312.<br>9.<br> Ship's condition-- heading back on impulse power only.<br> Main engines burned out.<br> The ship's space-warp ability--gone.<br> Earth bases, which were only days away are now years in the distance.<br> Our overriding question now is-- what destroyed the Valiant? They lived through the barrier, just as we have.<br> What happened to them after that? Autopsy report, sir.<br> Each case showed damage to the body's neural circuit.<br> An area of the brain was burned out.<br> And you-- are you feeling all right? Yes.<br> Mitchell, too, Except for his eyes.<br> We're trying to find a reason for that now, and why, out of our whole crew, only certain people were affected.<br> I thinks we've found that answer, Doctor.<br> You mentioned that tests show you have a high degree of extrasensory perception.<br> So do the records of the others.<br> Gary Mitchell has the highest esper rating of all.<br> lf you're suggesting there's anything dangerous-- Before the Valiant was destroyed, its captain was frantically searching for ESP information on his crew.<br> Espers are simply people with flashes of insight.<br> Are there not also those who seem to see through solid objects, cause fires to start spontaneously? There's nothing about it that could possibly make a person dangerous.<br> Dr.<br> Dehner is speaking of normal ESP power.<br> Perhaps you know of another kind? Do we know for sure, Doctor, that there isn't another kind? [Sighing] Hello, Jim.<br> Hey, you look worried.<br> I've been worried about you ever since that night on Deneb IV.<br> Yeah, she was nova, that one.<br> Not nearly as many aftereffects this time, except for the eyes.<br> They stare back at me when I'm shaving.<br> Do you feel any different? In a way, I feel better than I've ever felt before in my life.<br> It actually seems to have done me some good.<br> How? Well, I'm getting a chance to read some of that longhair stuff you like.<br> Hey, man, I remember you back at the academy-- a stack of books with legs.<br> The first thing I ever heard from upperclassmen was, ''Watch out for Lieutenant Kirk.<br> in his class, you either think or sink.<br>'' I wasn't that bad, was I? lf I hadn't aimed that little blonde lab technician at you-- You what? You--you planned that? Well, you wanted me to think, didn't you? I outlined her whole campaign for her.<br> I almost married her! You better be good to me.<br> I'm getting even better ideas here.<br> You? Spinoza? Once you get into him, he's rather simple.<br> Childish, almost.<br> I don't agree with him at all.<br> Go on.<br> Hey, I'm trying to tell you I feel fine.<br> When do I go back on duty? I'm going to ask Dr.<br> Dehner to keep you under observation for a while.<br> With almost a hundred women onboard, you can do better than that, friend Captain.<br> Consider it a challenge.<br> That doesn't seem very friendly.<br> [Echoing] Didn't I say you'd better [Without An Echo] be good to me? He's reading even faster now than just a few moments ago.<br> Is that Gary Mitchell, the one you used to know? Put a 24-hour watch on the sick bay.<br> Fullest possible range of examinations and tests.<br> Perfect, perfect.<br> I've never had a patient like you, Gary.<br> Even the healthiest are generally off on some reading.<br> I know you don't particularly like me, Mr.<br> Mitchell, but since I am assigned here, can we make the best of it? I've got nothing against you, Doctor.<br> Nor against the walking freezer unit? Well, l, uh sorry about that.<br> Women professionals do tend to overcompensate.<br> Now let's talk about you.<br> How do you feel? You know, everybody seems worried that I don't have some kind of fever or something.<br> Maybe if we could just change these dials-- Now back to normal, I think.<br> How did you do that? I'm not sure, l I just thought of making it happen, and it does.<br> It's-- Hey, uh Hey, watch this, Doc.<br> Stop it.<br> Stop it! You were dead for almost 22 seconds.<br> There were no readings at all.<br> Yeah.<br> Oh, boy.<br> You--you know, Doc, there have been other things, too, like going halfway through the ship's library in hardly a day.<br> Yeah.<br> Ooh, what's happening to me? Do you remember everything you read that quickly? Yeah.<br> On any tape? Sure.<br> Yeah.<br> Try this one.<br> Yeah.<br> Page 387.<br> ''My love has wings, ''slender, feathered things with grace in upswept curve and tapered tip.<br>'' The Nightingale Woman, written by Tarbolde on the Canopius planet back in 1996.<br> It's funny you picked that one, Doctor.<br> Why? That's one of the most passionate love sonnets of the past couple of centuries.<br> How do you feel, Doctor? What? How do you feel? I just fell.<br> Nothing happened.<br> No? Are you sure? Are you sure? Ahem.<br> Um, I was on my coffee break.<br> I thought I'd check up on-- Yeah! That's OK, Lee.<br> Come on in.<br> Don't let the light in my eyes bother you.<br> It's all for our our good-looking lady doctor here.<br> Yeah.<br> Sure.<br> So, uh so, how go the repairs? Well, the main engines are gone, unless we can find some way to re-energize them.<br> You better check the starboard impulse packs.<br> Those points have about decayed to lead.<br> Oh, yeah, sure, Mitch.<br> I'm not joking, Lee! You activate those packs, and you'll blow the whole impulse deck.<br> I'll, uh, get on it right away.<br> I just wanted to stop by and make sure you were OK.<br> See you later.<br> He's a fool.<br> A fool.<br> He'd seen those points, and he hadn't noticed their condition.<br> How do you know? The image of what he'd seen was still in his mind.<br> It didn't make any sense that he'd know, but naturally, I checked out the circuit anyway.<br> I don't know how, but he was right.<br> This point is burned out exactly the way he described it.<br> Sorry I'm late.<br> I became so interested in observing Gary-- Mr.<br> Mitchell.<br> Our subject is not Gary Mitchell.<br> Our concern is what he is mutating into.<br> I know those from your planet aren't suppose to have feelings like we do, but to talk that way about a man you've worked next to for years-- Enough, Doctor.<br> I don't think so.<br> I understand you least of all.<br> Gary told me you've been friends since he joined the service, that you asked for him aboard your first command.<br> It is my duty, whether pleasant or unpleasant, to listen to the reports, observations, even speculations, on any subject that might affect the safety of this vessel.<br> And it's my science officer's duty to see I'm provided with that.<br> Go ahead, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Have you noted evidence of unusual powers? He can control certain autonomic reflexes.<br> He reads very fast, retains more than most of us might consider usual.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, would you repeat what you just told us? About an hour ago, the bridge control started going crazy-- levers shifting by themselves, buttons being pushed, instrument readings changing.<br> And on my monitor screen, I could see Mitchell smiling each time it happened, as if this ship and crew were almost a toy for his amusement.<br> Are they right, Doctor? Has he shown abilities of such magnitude? I saw some such indications.<br> And you didn't think it worth mentioning ? No one's been hurt, have they? Don't you understand? A mutated superior man could also be a wonderful thing.<br> The forerunner of a new and better kind of human being.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> lf you want the mathematics of this, Mitchell's ability is increasing geometrically.<br> That is, like having a penny, doubling it every day.<br> In a month, you'll be a millionaire.<br> In less time than that, he will have attained powers we can't understand and can't cope with.<br> Soon we'll be not only useless to him, but actually an annoyance.<br> There'll be no discussion of this with the crew.<br> Thank you.<br> We'll never reach an Earth base with him aboard.<br> You heard the mathematics of it.<br> In a month he'll have as much in common with us as we'd have with a ship full of white mice.<br> I need a recommendation, not vague warnings.<br> Recommendation one-- there's a planet a few light-days away from here, Delta Vega, It has a lithium cracking station.<br> We may be able to adapt some of its power packs to our engines.<br> And if we can't? We'll be trapped in orbit there.<br> We haven't enough power to blast back out.<br> It is the only way to get Mitchell off this ship.<br> lf you mean strand Mitchell there, I won't do it! That station is fully automated.<br> There's not a soul on the whole planet.<br> Even the ore ships call only once every 20 years.<br> Then you have one other choice.<br> Kill Mitchell while you still can.<br> Get out of here.<br> It is your only other choice, assuming you make it while you still have time.<br> Will you try for one moment to feel? At least act like you've got a heart.<br> We're talking about Gary.<br> The captain of the Valiant probably felt the same way, and he waited too long to make his decision.<br> I think we've both guessed that.<br> Set course for Delta Vega.<br> Star date 1313.<br>1.<br> We're now approaching Delta Vega.<br> Course set for a standard orbit.<br> This planet, completely uninhabited, is slightly smaller than earth, desolate, but rich in crystal and minerals.<br> Kelso's task-- transport down with a repair party, try to regenerate the main engines, save the ship.<br> Our task-- transport down a man I've known for 15 years, and if we're successful, maroon him there.<br> I'm thirsty.<br> It's like a man who has been blind all of his life, suddenly being given sight.<br> Sometimes I feel there's nothing I couldn't do in time.<br> Some people think that makes me a monster, don't they, Jim? Are you reading all our thoughts, Gary? I can sense mainly worry in you, Jim.<br> Safety of your ship.<br> What would you do in my place? Probably just what Mr.<br> Spock is thinking now.<br> Kill me while you can.<br> Stop it, Gary! I also know we're orbiting Delta Vega, Jim.<br> I can't let you force me down there.<br> I may not want to leave this ship.<br> I may want another place.<br> I'm not sure yet just what kind of a world I can use.<br> Use? I don't understand it all yet, but if I keep growing, getting stronger, why, the things I could do, like like maybe a god could do.<br> I want him unconscious for a while.<br> Doctor! You fools! Soon I'll squash you like insects.<br> Energize.<br> Can you do it, Lee? lf we can bypass the fuel bins without blowing ourselves up.<br> There's not a soul on this planet but us? Nobody but us chickens, Doctor.<br> I think I've got the 203-R set, Lee.<br> Good, Alden.<br> Transport it up with you.<br> The fuel bins, could they be detonated from here? A destruct switch? I guess I could wire one up right there.<br> Do it.<br> He's regaining consciousness.<br> Doctor Piper.<br> I want only one medical officer here at any one time.<br> The other will monitor him on the dispensary screen.<br> I'd like to stay now, try to talk to him.<br> My friend, James Kirk.<br> remember those rodent things on Dimorus? The poisoned darts they threw? I took one meant for you.<br> And almost died.<br> I remember.<br> So why be afraid of me now? You've been testing your ability to take over the Enterprise.<br> In the transporter room, you said something about us seeming like insects by comparison, squashing us, if we got in your way.<br> I was drugged then.<br> Yes.<br> In the sick bay, you said if you were in my place, you'd kill a mutant like yourself.<br> Why don't you kill me then? Mr.<br> Spock is right.<br> You're a fool if you can't see it.<br> You don't mean that, Gary.<br> Man cannot survive if a race of true espers is born.<br> In time you'll understand that.<br> Gary Gary, don't! Jim His eyes went back to normal.<br> Fighting the force field drained his strength.<br> For a while, he could be handled.<br> I'll just keep getting stronger.<br> You know that, don't you? It fits like a glove, captain.<br> Oh Did Mr.<br> Spock get the phaser rifle we sent down? I didn't order any-- Affirmative.<br> Landing party out.<br> He tried to get through the force field again.<br> His eyes changed back faster.<br> He didn't become as weak.<br> Dr.<br> Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous.<br> What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong? Because she feels.<br> I don't.<br> All I know is logic.<br> We'll be lucky to repair this ship and get away in time.<br> Direct to the power bins.<br> From here, you could blow up this whole valley.<br> lf Mitchell gets out, at your discretion, Lee, if, sitting here, you think you're the last chance, I want you to hit that button.<br> Captain's log, Star date 1313.<br>3.<br> Note commendations on Lieutenant Kelso and the engineering staff.<br> In orbit above us, the engines of the Enterprise are almost fully regenerated.<br> Balance of the landing party is being transported back up.<br> Mitchell, whatever he's become, keeps changing, growing stronger by the minute.<br> He's been like that for hours now.<br> Have Dr.<br> Piper meet us in the control room with Kelso.<br> We'll all transport up together.<br> lf he should try to stop us-- Kelso will be on the destruct button until the last minute.<br> I think he knows that.<br> [Elizabeth] I'm staying behind with him.<br> Fission chamber 3 checks out.<br> The station seems to be running fine.<br> [Scotty] You're a talented thief, Kelso.<br> Everything you sent up seems to be fitting in place.<br> I'm proud of the job we've done.<br> We're gonna be ready to transport-- You're leaving with the ship, Doctor.<br> He is not evil.<br> I gave you an order.<br> You should have killed me while you could, James.<br> Command and compassion is a fool's mixture.<br> It hit me, too, whatever it was.<br> Kelso is dead.<br> Strangled.<br> At least Spock's alive.<br> Dr.<br> Dehner? She went with Mitchell.<br> Don't give him a pill until after I'm gone.<br> It's my fault Mitchell got as far as he did.<br> Did you see their direction? Yes.<br> There was some morning light.<br> They were headed across the valley, to the left of the pointed peaks.<br> There's flatlands beyond.<br> When Mr.<br> Spock recovers, you'll both transport up immediately to the Enterprise.<br> But Captain-- lf you have not received a signal from me within 12 hours, you'll proceed at maximum warp to the nearest Earth base with my recommendation this entire planet be subjected to a lethal concentration of neutron radiation.<br> No protest on this, Mark.<br> That's an order.<br> It would take almost a miracle to survive here.<br> Then I shall make one.<br> Behold.<br> You'll soon share this feeling, Elizabeth.<br> To be like God, to have the power to make the world anything you want it to be.<br> What's wrong?

You're still human-- No, I-- At least partly, you are! Or you wouldn't be here talking to me.<br> Earth is really unimportant.<br> Before long, we'll be where it would have taken mankind millions of years of learning to reach.<br> What will Mitchell learn in getting there? Will he know what to do with his power? Will he acquire the wisdom? Go back while you still can.<br> Did you hear him joke about compassion? Above all else, a god needs compassion.<br> Mitchell! Elizabeth What do you know about gods? Then let's talk about humans, about our frailties.<br> As powerful as he gets, he'll have that inside him.<br> Go back! You were a psychiatrist once.<br> You know the ugly, savage things we all keep buried, that none of us dare expose.<br> But he'll dare.<br> Who's to stop him? He doesn't need to care.<br> Be a psychiatrist for one minute longer.<br> What do you see happening to him? What's your prognosis, Doctor? He's coming.<br> Then watch him.<br> Hang on to being a human for one minute longer.<br> I'm disappointed in you, Elizabeth.<br> I've been contemplating the death of an old friend.<br> He deserves a decent burial, at least.<br> Stop it, Gary.<br> Morals are for men, not gods.<br> A god but still driven by human frailty.<br> Do you like what you see? Time to pray, Captain.<br> Pray to me.<br> To you? Not to both of you? Pray that you die easily.<br> There'll only be one of you in the end.<br> One jealous god if all this makes a god.<br> Or is it making you something else? Your last chance, Kirk.<br> Do you like what you see? Absolute power corrupting absolutely.<br> Hurry! You haven't much time.<br> Gary! Forgive me.<br> For a moment, James, but your moment is fading.<br> I'm sorry.<br> You can't know what it's like to be almost a god.<br> Enterprise.<br> From Captain Kirk.<br> Come in.<br> Captain's log, Star date 1313.<br>8.<br> Add to official losses, Dr.<br> Elizabeth Dehner.<br> Be it noted she gave her life in performance of her duty.<br> Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell.<br> Same notation.<br> I want his service record to end that way.<br> He didn't ask for what happened to him.<br> I felt for him, too.<br> I believe there's some hope for you after all, Mr.<br> Spock.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Well, Dr.<br> McCoy seemed to think I should check on you.<br> That's nice.<br> Come on, Spock, I know that look.<br> What is it? Well, our good doctor said that you were acting Iike a wild man, demanded brandy.<br> Our good doctor's been putting you on again.<br> Hmm.<br> Well, in that case, if you'll excuse the intrusion, I'll get back to work.<br> I'll tell him you were properly annoyed.<br> Captain.<br> What is it, Scotty?

Well, you-- He is the captain.<br> I couldn't just-- You started hurting me.<br> I had to fight you, scratch your face.<br> Yeoman.<br> And-- Look at me.<br> Look at my face.<br> Are there any scratches? I was sure I scratched you.<br> I was frightened.<br> Maybe-- Yeoman.<br> I was in my room.<br> It wasn't me.<br> Sir, Fisher saw you, too.<br> Fisher saw-- If it hadn't been-- I can understand.<br> I don't want to get you into trouble.<br> I wouldn't have even mentioned it!

Yes, sir.<br> I'm sure.<br> Back to that bed, bucko.<br> You can go now, Yeoman.<br> There's only one logical answer.<br> We have an impostor aboard.<br> Captain's Log, stardate 1672.<br>9.<br> On the planet's surface, temperatures are beginning to drop, our landing party there in growing jeopardy.<br> Due to the malfunction of the ship's transporter, an unexplained duplicate of myself definitely exists.<br> How did all this happen? When Fisher came up, his suit was covered with a soft yellow ore that had highly unusual properties.<br> It may have caused an overload.<br> Does the transporter work at all? Yes, but if we transport the landing party, it might duplicate.<br> How long will it take to find the trouble? Can't say, sir.<br> We just can't leave those four men down there.<br> It's getting dark.<br> They'll die! The surface temperature goes down to 120 degrees below zero.<br> We're doing everything we can, sir.<br> Yes, I know, Scotty.<br> About your double, Captain.<br> Yes, uhyes.<br> We'll have to find him.<br> Search parties, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Organize search parties.<br> We can't take a chance on killing it.<br> We don't know what would happen to you.<br> That's right.<br> We don't know, but the men have to be armed The men are to be armed, with their phasers locked, I repeat, locked, on setting number one.<br> There can't be any chance of him being killed.<br> He's to be taken without If the men are forced to fire, he can't be killed! How shall we explain it to them, Captain? The search parties are to capture you? Tell them The search parties, Captain.<br> I'll make an announcement to the entire crew, tell them what happened.<br> It's a good crew.<br> They deserve to know.<br> Captain, no disrespect intended, but you must surely realize you can't announce the full truth to the crew.<br> You haven't the right to be vulnerable in the eyes of the crew.<br> If you're anything less than perfect, they lose faith, and you lose command.<br> Yes, I do know that, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> What I don't know is why I forgot that just now.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> If you see me slipping again, your orders your orders are to tell me.<br> Understood, Captain.<br> Captain's Log, stardate 1673.<br>1.<br> Something has happened to me.<br> Somehow, in being duplicated, I have lost my strength of will.<br> Decisions are becoming more and more difficult.<br> This is the captain speaking.<br> There's an impostor aboard the ship, a man who looks exactly like me.<br> This man is dangerous.<br> Utmost caution is to be observed.<br> All crew members are to arm themselves.<br> The impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.<br> Repeat--the impostor may be identified by scratches on his face.<br> Section chiefs, assign personnel to the search.<br> All search parties report toMr.<br> Spock for assignment.<br> Something? About the phaser weapons.<br> To be set for stunning force and locked.<br> Oh, yes, yes.<br> All hand phasers must be set on base cycle, stunning force.<br> The impostor is not to be injured.<br> Use minimum force.<br> I'm Captain Kirk! --Is not to be injured.<br> I'm Captain Kirk.<br> I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! I'm Captain Kirk! Wilson! Sir? Wilson, give me your phaser.<br> Yes, sir.<br> How have you been? Fine, sir.<br> How's it going down there, Mr.<br> Sulu? It's already Can't exactly call it balmy.<br> Isn't there any way we can help them? Thermal heaters were transported down.<br> They duplicated.<br> They won't operate.<br> Then we've got to get those men up.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? Spock here.<br> Transporter Technician Wilson found injured near the captain's cabin.<br> He says the impostor attacked him, called him by name, took his hand phaser.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Continue the search.<br> We've got to find him before he-- But how? Apparently, this double, however different in temperament, has your knowledge of the ship-- its crew, its devices.<br> This being the case, perhaps we can outguess him by determining his next move.<br> Knowing how the ship is designed, where would you go to elude a search? The lower levels.<br> The engineering deck.<br> Set and locked on base cycle to stun, not to kill.<br> What about your phaser, Captain? Don't you think we ought to get some help? No.<br> I don't want anyone else to see the Captain, you ordered me to tell you.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, if I'm to be the captain, I've got to act like one.<br> You can't hurt me.<br> You can't kill me.<br> You can't.<br> Don't you understand? I'm part of you.<br> You need me.<br> I need you.<br> I don't need you.<br> [Electrical Crackling] He'll be regaining consciousness soon, and not knowing what his physical state is, I won't give him a tranquilizer.<br> We'd better bind him.<br> Yesyes.<br> All right.<br> What's the matter with me? Judging from my observations, Captain, you're losing the power of decision.<br> You have a point, Spock? Yes.<br> Always, Doctor.<br> We have here an unusual opportunity to appraise the human mind, or to examine, in Earth terms, the roles of good and evil in a man-- his negative side, which you call hostility, lust, violence, and his positive side, which Earth people express as compassion, Iove, tenderness.<br> Are you aware it's the captain's guts you're analyzing? Yes, and what makes one man an exceptional leader? We see indications that it's his negative side which makes him strong, that his evil side, controlled and disciplined, is vital to his strength.<br> Your negative side removed from you, the power of command begins to elude you.<br> What is your point, Mr.<br> Spock? If your power of command weakens, you'll be unable to be captain.<br> You must be prepared for that.<br> You have your intellect, Jim.<br> You can fight with that! For how long? If I seem insensitive to what you're going through, understand-- it's the way I am.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, sir, on the lower level of the engineering deck.<br> I found the new trouble with the transporter.<br> The casing has a gap ripped in it.<br> The main circuits have been burned through.<br> The abort control circuit is gone altogether.<br> Can you give us a status report, Captain? Temperature's still dropping.<br> Now 41 degrees below zero.<br> We've located the trouble.<br> It shouldn't be much longer.<br> Could you find a long rope somewhere and lower us down a pot of hot coffee? I'll see what we can do.<br> Rice wine will do, if you're short on coffee.<br> Engineering deck, Kirk here.<br> Scott here, Captain.<br> That unit, Scotty, status report.<br> The transporter unit ionizer-- Nothing much left of it, sir.<br> How bad is it? We can't repair it in less than a week.<br> Captain's Log, stardate 1673.<br>5.<br> Transporter still inoperable.<br> My negative self is under restraint in sick bay.<br> My own indecisiveness growing.<br> My force of will steadily weakening.<br> On the planet, condition critical.<br> Surface temperature is 75 degrees below zero, still dropping.<br> I think we ought to give room service another call.<br> That coffee's taking too long.<br> Enterprise, this is Sulu.<br> Kirk here, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Hot line direct to the captain? Are we that far gone? I gave everybody the afternoon off.<br> I'm watching the store.<br> How is it down there? Oh, lovely, except that the frost is building up.<br> We're using hand phasers to heat the rocks.<br> One phaser quit on us.<br> Three still operating.<br> Any possibility of getting us back aboard before the skiing season opens down here? This is Spock, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> You'll have to hold on a little longer.<br> There's no other way.<br> Survival procedures, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Per your training program, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! What happened? Apparently the body functioning weakened during the duplication process-- A fact I failed to consider.<br> He's not dying? Yes, he is.<br> Help me.<br> How can he die? Can I survive without him? I don't know, Jim.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Here's my hand.<br> Hold on.<br> You don't have to be afraid.<br> Hold on! You won't be afraid if you use your mind! That's it! Jim, he is back! Jim.<br> You can use that brandy now.<br> In fact, I'll join you.<br> I have to take him back inside myself.<br> I can't survive without him.<br> I don't want him back.<br> He's like an animal, a thoughtless, brutal animal, and yet it's me me.<br> Jim you're no different than anyone else.<br> We all have our darker side.<br> We need it! It's half of what we are.<br> It's not ugly.<br> It's human.<br> Human.<br> A lot of what he is makes you the man you are.<br> God forbid I should agree with Spock, but he was right.<br> Without the negative side, you couldn't be the captain.<br> Your strength of command lies mostly in him.<br> What do I have? You have the goodness.<br> Not enough.<br> I have a ship to command.<br> The intelligence, the logic-- It appears your half has most of that, and perhaps that's where man's essential courage comes from.<br> For you see, he was afraid, and you weren't.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Spock here.<br> Come to the transporter room.<br> We may have found an answer.<br> Coming.<br> What is it? We got the transporter working.<br> We've attached to some bypass and leader circuits to compensate for the difference, tied directly into the impulse engines.<br> There shouldn't be more than a 5-point variation in the velocity balance.<br> I suggest we send the animal through.<br> Captain? Yes.<br> Go ahead.<br> [Growling And Snarling] I'll hold him as long as I can.<br> Don't hurt him.<br> It's painless and quick.<br> The animal will be unconscious for only a few minutes.<br> [Buzzing] [Scott] lf this doesn't work, I don't know what will.<br> Energize.<br> Reverse.<br> The shock of putting him back together was too much for him.<br> He's dead, Jim.<br> [Spock] Captain's Log, stardate 1673.<br>1.<br> Entry made by Second Officer Spock.<br> Captain Kirk retains command of this vessel, but his force of will rapidly fading.<br> Condition of landing party critical.<br> Transporter unit still under repair.<br> Autopsy in-depth.<br> Hurry.<br> I don't know.<br> Animal could have died of some kind of shock.<br> For once, I agree with you.<br> I said \"could have,\" Spock.<br> We won't know until we get a post-mortem.<br> No autopsy is necessary to know that the animal was terrified.<br> It was split into two and thrust back together.<br> Thus shock induced by blind terror.<br> That sounds likely.<br> It couldn't understand.<br> You can.<br> You have your intelligence controlling your fear.<br> Get the transporter room ready.<br> Could be, if, maybe-- All guesswork, just theory.<br> Give me a chance to do an autopsy and let Spock check the transporter circuits again.<br> That sounds reasonable.<br> We should double-check everything.<br> Aren't you forgetting something, Captain? No, I don't think I f-- Your men on the planet, how much time do they have? Yes.<br> The men.<br> We have to take the chance.<br> Suppose it wasn't shock, Jim.<br> Suppose death was caused by transporter malfunction.<br> Then you'd die.<br> They'd die, anyway.<br> Don't risk your life on a theory! Being split in two halves is no theory with me, Doctor.<br> I have a human half and an alien half at war with each other.<br> Personal experience, Doctor.<br> I survive because my intelligence wins, makes them live together.<br> Your intelligence would enable you to survive, as well.<br> Help me.<br> Somebody make the decision.<br> Are you relinquishing command, Captain? No.<br> No, I'm not.<br> Well, then we can't help you, Jim.<br> The decision is yours.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, ready the transporter room.<br> Bones, continue the autopsy.<br> [Uhura] Captain Kirk, I have a tie-in with Sulu now.<br> Kirk here.<br> CaptainK-Kirk Sulu here.<br> Can'tlast much longer.<br> Can't see clearly, Doctor, to read top indicator.<br> Think the cold penetrating communicator.<br> Two menunconscious.<br> No time.<br> No Can't wait.<br> No time.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Can't wait.<br> Can't let them die.<br> What will you do? Go through the transporter, both of us.<br> There's nothing I can do to stop you? It's what I have to do.<br> It's what I have to do, what we have to do.<br> I won't fight you anymore.<br> Oh I feel so weak.<br> I'll be glad when this is over.<br> Janice, hello.<br> Captain, l-- Yeoman, I owe you an explanation.<br> The transporter malfunctioned, divided me, created a duplicate.<br> The animal part of me came to your cabin.<br> He even scratched me to make us look more alike.<br> I'd like the chance to explain it to you.<br> You don't mind if I come to your cabin later? No, sir.<br> Bridge.<br> No word from Mr.<br> Sulu, sir.<br> Prepare to leave orbit, Mr.<br> Farrell.<br> Captain-- I gave you an order.<br> They can't be saved.<br> Prepare to leave orbit.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain, I thought-- I've changed my mind.<br> [Door Opens] Grab him.<br> He's the impostor.<br> No! McCoy, he's fooled you.<br> He attacked him.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you know who I am and what that is.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, which one? What do we do? We'll let the captain handle this.<br> I'm the captain.<br> Isn't that obvious? Look at his face.<br> Remember the scratches? He's hiding them.<br> He wants you to think that he's Captain Kirk.<br> You know who I am.<br> Yes, I know.<br> You want to kill me, don't you? Farrell, James, grab him! He'll destroy the ship! Don't you understand? I'm captain of the ship! I'm the captain! This is my ship! My ship! It's mine! I'll kill you.<br> Can half a man live? Take another step, you'll die.<br> Then we'll both die.<br> Please.<br> I don't want to.<br> Don't make me.<br> I don't want to go back.<br> Please! I want to live! You will.<br> Both of us.<br> I want to live! You'll have to hold on to him, Captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Captain? If this doesn't work Understood, Captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Ready.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock? Jim? Get those men aboard fast.<br> Right away, Captain.<br> Severe exposure and frostbite, but I think they'll make it.<br> How do you feel, Jim? How? I've seen a part of myself no man should ever see.<br> Status report, green.<br> All sections report ready, sir.<br> Good.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock from both of us.<br> Shall I pass that on to the crew, sir? The impostor's where he belongs.<br> Let's forget him.<br> Captain.<br> The impostor told me what happened, who he really was, and I'd just like to say that well, sir, what I'd like-- Thank you, Yeoman.<br> The, uh, impostor had some interesting qualities, wouldn't you say, Yeoman?

Me personal guarantee on that.<br> The entire ship's power is feeding through one lithium crystal.<br> Well, switch to by-pass circuits.<br> We burned them all out when we super-heated.<br> That jackass Walsh not only wrecked his vessel, but in saving-- That's one jackass we're going to see skinned.<br> But it's frustrating.<br> Almost a million gross tons of vessel depending on a hunk of crystal the size of my fist.<br> That won't last pulling all our power.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock? There's a lithium mining operation on Rigel-12.<br> High-grade ore, I've heard.<br> Location and distance.<br> Mr.<br> Farrell has the course.<br> Less than two day's travel.<br> Make for Rigel-12.<br> Rigel-12, Mr.<br> Farrell.<br> You have the course.<br> Captain's log-- Stardate 1329.<br>2.<br> On board the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise, a ship's hearing is being convened against the transport vessel's captain.<br> I'm becoming concerned about the almost-hypnotic effect produced by the women.<br> This hearing is convened.<br> Stardate 1329.<br>2, on board starship U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> Formal hearings against transport captain Leo Walsh.<br> Start computer.<br> State your name for the record.<br> Leo Francis Walsh.<br> Incorrect.<br> Your correct name.<br> Gentlemen, you're not going to take the word of a mechanical device over that of a man.<br> [Sigh] State your correct name for the record.<br> - Harry Mudd.<br> - Incorrect.<br> Harcourt Fenton Mudd.<br> Any past offenses, Mr.<br> Mudd? Of course not.<br> Gentlemen, I'm simply an honest businessman.<br> Incorrect.<br> Blast that tin-plated pot.<br> Full data coming on screen.<br> If it can read our minds, too It can't, darling.<br> Just what's on the record.<br> Offense record-- smuggling.<br> Sentencesuspended.<br> Transport of stolen goods.<br> Purchase of space vessel with counterfeit currency.<br> Sentences-- psychiatric treatment effectiveness disputed.<br> Mr.<br> Mudd, you're charged with galaxy travel without a flight plan, without an identification beam, and failure to answer a starship's signal, thus a menace to navigation.<br> My tiny ship in this immense galaxy a menace to navigation? You're also charged with operation of a vessel without a master's license.<br> Untrue! I have a master's ticket.<br> Incorrect.<br> Master's license revoked Stardate 1116.<br>4.<br> All right.<br> Well, very simply, Leo Walsh, who was to be my captain on this trip, passed away suddenly.<br> Well, I had no choice but to take out me ship me own self.<br> I assumed Leo's name out of courtesy to him.<br> In memoriam, as it were.<br> A fine, fine man, alas, gone to his reward.<br> Destination and purpose of journey? Planet Ophiuchus-3.<br> Wiving settlers.<br> Come again, Mr.<br> Mudd.<br> You do what? I recruit wives for settlers, a difficult but satisfying task.<br> Data on witnesses.<br> No data.<br> Computer, go to sensor probe.<br> Any unusual readings? No decipherable reading on females.<br> However, unusual reading on male board members.<br> Detecting high respiration patterns, perspiration rates up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than normal.<br> Uh, that's sufficient.<br> Strike that from the record, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You see, gentlemen, just as I told you.<br> Three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men, to supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed-- a wife, a home, a family.<br> Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust.<br> I've devoted me whole life to it.<br> Incorrect.<br> Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it.<br> Did these ladies come voluntarily? Well, of course! Now, for example, Ruthie comes from a pelagic planet-- sea ranchers.<br> Magda there from helium experimental station.<br> It's the same for all of us.<br> No men.<br> Mine was a farm planet with automated machines for company and two brothers to cook for, mend their clothes, canal mud on their boots all the time.<br> Fine, Evie.<br> Fine.<br> It's not fine! We've got men willing to be our husbands waiting for us, and you're taking us in the opposite direction! Staring at us Iike we were Saturnius harem girls or something.<br> That's enough, Evie.<br> The only charges are against Mr.<br> Mudd.<br> Illegal operation of a vessel.<br> Do you have any defense? Only heaven's own truth, which I've just given you.<br> The hearing is closed.<br> Mr.<br> Mudd to be handed over to the legal authorities at our earliest opportunity.<br> And what about us? What happens to us? Help us, please.<br> Miss McHuron, if you don't mind-- Our last crystal, sir.<br> It's gone.<br> Captain Kirk, engineering section reports our entire life-support system is now on batteries.<br> Mr.<br> Spock-- Miss McHuron, please.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, will you contact the miners on Rigel-12? Notify them that we'll need the lithium crystals immediately upon arrival.<br> Oh, you beautiful galaxy! Oh, that heavenly universe! Well, girls, lithium miners.<br> Don't you understand? Lonely, isolated, overworked, rich Iithium miners! Girls, do you still want husbands, hmm? Evie, you won't settle for a ship's captain.<br> I'll get you a man who can buy planets.<br> Maggie, you're going to be a countess.<br> Ruth, I'll make you a duchess.<br> And l-- I'll be running this starship.<br> Captain James Kirk, the next orders you're taking will be given by Harcourt Fenton Mudd! Captain's log-- Stardate 1330.<br>1.<br> Position-- We're on auxiliary impulse engines.<br> Fuel low, barely sufficient to achieve orbit over the planet.<br> Lithium replacements are now imperative.<br> The effect of Mudd's women on my crew continues to grow.<br> Harry Mudd is confined to his quarters under guard.<br> [Female Voice] May I come in? Why, yes, please do.<br> By all means.<br> Connors, are you finished? I was wondering what this place looked like.<br> [Beeping] It's fascinating.<br> Would--Would you walk past my panel again, please? Your what? - My medical scanner.<br> - Oh, why? You're not giving me an examination, are you? No.<br> I wouldn't trust my-- my judgment, believe me.<br> Just walk by, please.<br> [Beeping] It's not supposed to do that.<br> I wondered, will you be examining the miners on Rigel-12? Yes, if they need it.<br> - You haven't asked? - [Beeping Stops] - Are they in good health? - What? Oh, yes, they're in excellent health, all three of them.<br> Oh.<br> Three.<br> Are you wearing some unusual kind of perfume or something radioactive, my dear? No.<br> I'm just me.<br> Wonder what makes it do that.<br> Captain? I hope you don't mind.<br> As a matter of fact, Miss McHuron, I do.<br> I was taking a walk, and I had to run in someplace.<br> All your men were looking at me, following me with their eyes.<br> Yes.<br> I'll have to talk to them about that.<br> They, uh-- They don't do that ordinarily, Miss McHuron, but somehow, in your case, and the ladies with you-- Well, they're probably just lonely.<br> I can understand loneliness.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, uh, now, Miss McHuron-- I--I suppose you understand it even more.<br> I mean, having to run a huge ship like this with so much responsibility every minute and having to be so careful with all your men looking up to you.<br> Well, it probably appears more difficult than it is.<br> Hmm! I read once that a commander has to act like a paragon of virtue.<br> I never met a paragon.<br> Neither have l.<br> Well, of course not.<br> No one is.<br> But some people try to pretend.<br> Um-- Do you, Captain? Miss McHuron, I don't-- Oh, no! Oh! I just can't do it.<br> I don't care what Harry Mudd says.<br> I do like you, but I just can't go through with it.<br> I hate this whole thing! Just three? You sure? Yes.<br> The miners are healthy and fairly young.<br> Later, dear, later.<br> Magda, did you get to your communications man? The head miner is named Ben Childress.<br> The others are Gossett and Benton.<br> And they've been there-- Almost three years now, alone! Perfect.<br> Perfect.<br> Three of them and three lovely ladies has Harry Mudd.<br> And lithium crystals, my dear, are worth 300 times their weight in diamonds, thousands of times their weight in gold.<br> But they'll be down there, and we'll be up here, circling a hundred miles above them.<br> There's a guard outside your door.<br> You can't get out of your cabin.<br> After one more job for you, it won't be Harry Mudd that's trapped.<br> It will be a gentleman named James T I don't like you, and I'm not very happy with myself, either.<br> Well, I'm not really surprised.<br> I've seen you noticing the captain.<br> We're supposed to notice them! Oh.<br> Oh, Harry.<br> I don't feel very good.<br> I think it must be near the time.<br> I asked for a preorbital course, Mr.<br> Farrell.<br> [Beep] Preorbital course locked in, sir.<br> That's the last time I'm giving an order twice, gentlemen.<br> We're down to battery power.<br> It'll get us to Rigel-12, sir.<br> Just hang us in long enough to get six crystals.<br> I'll get you there.<br> Ridiculous.<br> What are we running here? Did you examine them? Did you examine Eve? She refused.<br> Well, come on, you're the doctor.<br> What is it? Is it that we're tired, and they're beautiful? They are incredibly beautiful.<br> Are they, Jim? Are they actually more lovely, pound for pound, measurement for measurement, than any other women you've known? Or is it that they just well, act beautiful.<br> No, strike that.<br> Strike that.<br> What are they, Bones? You mean are they alien illusions? That sort of thing? I asked you first.<br> No an alien smart enough to pull this could also keep my medical scanner from going \"bleep!\" - I don't follow you.<br> - I don't either.<br> Top-space frequency of 3-9.<br> [Communicator Beeps] Rigel-12.<br> Rigel-12.<br> This is Rigel-12.<br> Come in, Enterprise.<br> This isn't exactly the Enterprise.<br> My name is Harry Mudd.<br> To whom have I the pleasure of speaking, sir? Power curve still dropping, Captain.<br> We'll make orbit, sir.<br> A temporary one.<br> Lay in.<br> Computer? We can sustain this orbit for three days, seven hours.<br> More than enough time.<br> Communications, have a Rigel-12 representative meet us.<br> Beam him up first pass over their camp.<br> Look what's happening.<br> Look at my face.<br> Give us the pills.<br> What if someone sees us like this? You'll never find them, Harry.<br> And if you do find them, you know what they are? A cheat.<br> If you care for someone, really care-- For whom, Evie? For Kirk? Ship's captains are already married to their vessels.<br> You'd find out the first time you came between him and the ship.<br> I'm going back to what I was--ugly.<br> I can't stand myself like this.<br> Why did you hide them, Harry? Don't you trust us? I didn't hide them.<br> I put them in a safe place.<br> Find the pill, Harry! Mattress! Yes! Here! Go on, Eve.<br> Take it.<br> It's not a cheat.<br> It's a miracle for some man who can appreciate it and who needs it.<br> Even burned and cracked, they're beautiful.<br> Destroying them was a shame.<br> The choice was burning this lithium crystal or the destruction of another man's ship.<br> - [Door Buzzer Buzzes] - Come.<br> Mining Chief Childress and Mr.<br> Gossett.<br> Show them in.<br> I'm James Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.<br> This is my science officer Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Let's get right to business.<br> We've got lithium crystals.<br> I'm authorized to pay an equitable price.<br> We're not sure they're for sale.<br> We might prefer a swap.<br> - What did you have in mind? - Mudd's women.<br> We'd like to have a look at them first.<br> Trot them out, Captain.<br> Either way, I've agreed to have Harry Mudd released.<br> Charges dropped.<br> Ha ha ha! Is there anything else? You've got no choice, Kirk.<br> You beam a landing party down, and you won't find one blessed crystal.<br> No deal.<br> You're a long way out in space, gentlemen.<br> You'll need medical help, cargo runs, starship protection.<br> You want to consider that? Come along, ladies.<br> You must be Ben Childress.<br> Come on now, girls.<br> And you must be Herm Gossett.<br> Yes, I reckon I am.<br> One thing I'll say for you, Mudd, you're not a liar.<br> Ladies, you are welcome.<br> It's still no deal! Conserving batteries, sir.<br> Half power.<br> I'm told they have only three days of orbit left before they start spiraling in.<br> I hate to see you suffering such a situation, Captain.<br> The sad fact is, you will deal.<br> Sooner or later, you'll have to.<br> Captain's log-- Transporting down to surface of planet Rigel-12 to acquire replacement lithium crystals.<br> Expect further difficulty from miners.<br> [Music Playing] All right, Childress, you've won.<br> I'll take the lithium crystals.<br> When I have the time, Kirk.<br> Ha ha ha! Childress.<br> We're busy, Mr.<br> Kirk.<br> We don't have the time to spare, Captain.<br> You got a better idea? Blows like that all the time.<br> [Wind Howling] You can get lost a dozen feet from your doorstep.<br> The wind comes up sudden.<br> [Sizzling] Magnetic storm.<br> That means the wind will really rip soon.<br> Dance with me.<br> - Would you like to dance? - No, l-- [Coughing] No.<br> I'm sorry, I guess it must be the dust.<br> That's the way it is on Rigel all the time.<br> [Laughing] - Hey.<br> - Go away.<br> - I'm cutting in.<br> - Not on me.<br> What's the matter with you? Why don't you run a raffle and the loser gets me? You can't go out there! Just have those crystals here when I get back.<br> Eve! Eve! Captain's log-- Have transported aboard the Enterprise to search with infrared scanners and sensing system.<br> Magnetic storms on the planet's surface are reducing efficiency of our equipment.<br> Search now in progress for 3 hours, 18 minutes.<br> Traverse parallel three and four.<br> Checking but not getting much.<br> The storm is ionizing the atmosphere.<br> Getting difficult to probe through it.<br> Captain, this is draining our batteries further.<br> - If we only had those crystals.<br> - But we don't! I didn't get any.<br> Satisfied, Mr.<br> Scott? Losing communications with the miners, sir.<br> Magnetic storm seems worse.<br> Has Childress reported in yet?

I've not laid a hand on you.<br> Remember that.<br> Oh, the sound of male ego.<br> You travel halfway across the galaxy, and it's still the same song.<br> There.<br> You going to eat or talk? I guess I'm supposed to sit, taste, and roll my eyes.<br> \"Ooh, female cooking again.<br>\" I've tasted better, by my own hand.<br> You're tasting some of it.<br> I couldn't scrape your leavings out of that pan.<br> Find me some decent water, then talk.<br> Well, why don't you hang your pan out in the wind and let the sand blast it clean? Hadn't you thought about that? It might work.<br> That solitaire? Double jack.<br> The red eight ought to go on the black nine.<br> Not in double jack.<br> You're not only plain as an old bucket, you're not even good company.<br> What the devil happened to your looks, anyway? I got tired of you.<br> I slumped.<br> You're homely! I've got enough in crystals already to buy queens by the gross!

I've heard of it, but isn't that just a story? Oh, it exists, illegally.<br> Well, actually, you see, it's a relatively harmless drug.<br> - Harmless? - Yeah, uh-- Well, what it does is give you more of whatever you have.<br> Well, with men, it makes them more muscular.<br> Women, rounder.<br> Men, more aggressive.<br> Women, more feminine.<br> He gave it to the women before you met them.<br> Does that mean the others they look like she does? - Mr.<br> Childress, l-- - Is that what it means? Yes, that's what it means! What happened to my partners? They left during the storm.<br> They're married-- subspace radio marriage.<br> It was a fraud.<br> They can get out of it.<br> If they want to.<br> Why? - You can't condemn the women.<br> - I can! A man goes out and fights, almost dies.<br> We all almost die.<br> We should have, but we didn't.<br> And now that we've got the good life in our hands, you bring us women for wives-- You don't want wives! You want this.<br> This is what you want, Mr.<br> Childress.<br> I hope you remember it, because you can't have it! It's not real! Is this the kind of wife you want, Ben? Not someone to help you.<br> Not a wife to cook and sew and cry and need, but this kind.<br> Selfish, vain, useless.<br> Is this what you really want? All right, then.<br> Here it is.<br> Quite a woman, eh, Childress? A fake pumped up by a drug.<br> By herself.<br> She took no drug.<br> - I swallowed it.<br> - Colored gelatin.<br> Yes, they took away my drug and substituted that.<br> But that can't be.<br> - There's only one kind of woman.<br> - Or man.<br> You either believe in yourself, or you don't.<br> Childress, I've gone as far with you as I intend to.<br> I want those lithium crystals now.<br> [Communicator Beeps] - Enterprise, this is Kirk.<br> - Spock here, Captain.<br> Stand by.<br> Do I beam down a search party? No.<br> The crystals are here, and you're welcome to them.<br> Stand by, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're coming aboard with the lithium crystals.<br> How many coming? Eve will stay today, at least.<br> We, uh-- We want to talk.<br> Eve? You've got someone up there called the Enterprise.<br> Two of us, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Come along, Mr.<br> Mudd.<br> Don't you think you could, by accident, arrange to leave me behind? That would be punishment enough.<br> I can't do that, Harry.<br> But I will appear as a character witness at your trial, if you think that'll help.<br> They'll throw away the key.<br> That must have been quite a talk.<br> Ever try considering the patent medicine business? Why should I work your side of the street? I'm happy the affair is over.<br> A most annoying emotional episode.<br> Smack right in the old heart.<br> Oh, I'm sorry.<br> In your case, it would be about here.<br> The fact that my internal arrangement differs from yours, Doctor, pleases me no end.<br> Course plotted and all systems in operation.<br> Engines engaged.<br> Helm answering.<br> Out of orbit, sir.<br> Ahead full.<br> Ahead full, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Even Ruk doesn't know.<br> With his help, with the records I could find, we built Brown.<br> You've convinced me, Doctor.<br> You've convinced me that you're dangerous.<br> [Crash] Ruk, no! I do not understand.<br> Why are you unhappy? You are with Roger again.<br> Where is Captain Kirk? You are concerned about the captain? Yes, I am concerned.<br> How can you love Roger without trusting him? Why does it bother you when I use the name Roger? Andrea, it's sufficient that it does disturb her.<br> You will call me Dr.<br> Korby from now on, Andrea.<br> Yes, Dr.<br> Korby.<br> I didn't mean to eavesdrop, darling.<br> As you can see, uh, Captain Kirk is fine.<br> He won't be harmed.<br> The things at stake here simply make it necessary he doesn't report to his ship.<br> I need time to explain and demonstrate to him and to you.<br> Now shall we start with Andrea? Yes, let's start with Andrea.<br> I'm like Dr.<br> Brown-- an android.<br> Didn't you know? Remarkable, isn't she? Notice the-- the lifelike pigmentation, the variation in skin tones.<br> The flesh-- The flesh has warmth.<br> There's even a pulse, Physical sensation.<br> How convenient.<br> Christine, you must realize an android's like a computer.<br> It does only what I program.<br> As a scientist, you must realize-- that given a mechanical Dr.<br> Brown, a mechanical geisha would be no more difficult.<br> You think I could love a machine? Did you? Andrea's incapable of that.<br> She simply obeys orders.<br> She has no meaning for me.<br> There's no emotional bond.<br> Andrea Kiss, uh, Captain Kirk.<br> Now strike him.<br> You see? There's no emotion in it, no emotional involvement.<br> She simply responds to orders.<br> She's a totally logical computer, a thing.<br> Not a woman.<br> Now do you understand? If these mechanical things have no feelings and perform only as you program them, then why did Brown try to shoot me? Why did he kill two of my men? There are many things I don't understand, Doctor.<br> I will answer all of your questionsnow.<br> This is how you make an android.<br> [Machine Beeps] Andrea.<br> [Low Rumbling] He's not being harmed.<br> I promise.<br> Roger, what's happened to you? When I sat in your class, you wouldn't even dream of harming an insect or an animal.<br> Their life was sacred to you then.<br> If I'd simply beamed up to their vessel with Brown and the others, I'd have given them objects of curiosity, beginnings of wild stories, foolish theories.<br> Ruk! [High-Pitched Squealing] Now watch carefully.<br> Choose, Christine.<br> Which is your captain? I don't know.<br> They're exact.<br> I honestly don't know.<br> Synthetic organs are in place.<br> We merely synchronize them with Kirk's autonomic nervous system, duplicating the rhythms of his body.<br> At the same time, we duplicate the mental pattern.<br> Now physical pattern complete, we now make a mental pattern.<br> Ready for final synaptic fusion.<br> Andrea, stand by for cortex circuits.<br> The android will be so perfect, It could even replace the captain.<br> The same memories, the same attitudes, the same abilities.<br> Activate circuits.<br> Mind your own business, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm sick of your half-breed interference.<br> Mind your own business, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm sick of your-- [Buzz] [Static] Complete.<br> Are you all right? As far as I know.<br> Now Meet an android.<br> How do you do, Miss Chapel? I am now programmed to please you also.<br> Is the food appealing? Yes, thank you.<br> Please sit, Captain.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm more or less on parole, I understand.<br> Dr.<br> Korby suggested that you have lunch.<br> He thought you might have a few things to talk about.<br> Captain I know, I know.<br> I'd hate to be torn between commander and fiancee myself.<br> No, I'm not torn.<br> I'm puzzled.<br> I'm worried.<br> Has he confided in you? Nothing he hasn't told you.<br> I know it doesn't make sense.<br> What he's done may seem wrong, but he is Roger Korby, whatever he seems to be doing.<br> Unless something's gone wrong with his mind.<br> No.<br> You're forgetting how well I know him.<br> He's as sane as us.<br> Nurse if I gave you a direct order to betray him Please.<br> Don't ask me to make that choice.<br> I'd rather you push me off the same precipice where Mathews died.<br> Oh, no, I can't.<br> Please, go ahead and eat.<br> Androids don't eat, Miss Chapel.<br> Even has your sense of humor.<br> There's one difference between us--I'm hungry.<br> The difference is your weakness, Captain, not mine.<br> One at a time, gentlemen.<br> Captain? Eating is a pleasure, sir.<br> Unfortunately, one you will never know.<br> Perhaps, but I will never starve, sir.<br> He's an exact duplicate? In every detail.<br> What about memory? Tell me about Sam.<br> George Samuel Kirk, your brother.<br> Only you call him Sam.<br> He saw me off on this mission.<br> Yes, with his wife and three sons.<br> He said he was being transferred to Earth colony 2 research station.<br> No, Captain.<br> He said he was continuing his research.<br> He wanted to be transferred to Earth colony 2.<br> It's like outthinking a calculating machine.<br> Obviously, I can't but we do have some interesting differences.<br> Totally unimportant ones.<br> You may leave now.<br> You haven't guessed the rest, hmm? Not even you, Christine? What you saw was only a machine, Only half of what I could've accomplished, Do you understand? By continuing the process, I could've transferred you, your very consciousness into that android, your soul, if you wish.<br> All of you.<br> In android form, a human being can have practical immortality.<br> Can you understand what I'm offering mankind? Programming.<br> Different word, but the same old promises made by Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar, Hitler, Ferris, Maltuvis.<br> Can you understand that a human converted to an android can be programmed for the better? Can you imagine how life could be improved if we could do away with jealousy, greed, hate? It can also be improved by eliminating love, tenderness, sentiment, the other side of the coin, Doctor.<br> No one need ever die again.<br> No disease, No deformities.<br> Why, even fear can be programmed away, replaced with joy.<br> I'm offering you a practical heaven, a new paradise, and all I need is your help.<br> All you wanted before was my understanding.<br> I need transportation to a planet colony with proper raw materials.<br> There are several good possibilities among your next stops.<br> No diversion from your route.<br> I want no suspicions aroused.<br> I'll begin producing androids carefully, selectively.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> No one need know, only to frighten uninformed minds.<br> They must be strongly infiltrated into society before the android existence is revealed.<br> I want no hysteria to destroy what is good and right.<br> You with me, Captain? You've created your own Kirk.<br> Why do you need me? I created him to impress you, not to replace you.<br> I'm impressed, Doctor but not the way you think! Stand back, Ruk! I'll kill him! Stay back.<br> Ruk protect! Roger, l Ruk! No! [Nurse Chapel] Ruk, stop! Dr.<br> Korby said you are to obey me! Ruk! Ruk! Ruk, I order you not to harm him! [Snap] [Christine's Voice] Captain Kirk! Where are you? Captain Kirk! I can help you! Christine, is that you? Captain! Captain We finished ahead of schedule.<br> Dr.<br> Korby has considerable cargo to beam aboard.<br> I'll have to go over our destination schedule.<br> You're going back down? Mind your own business, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm sick of your half-breed interference, do you hear? Yes, very well, Captain.<br> You look upset, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Is everything all right? No problems here, sir.<br> Good.<br> I'll beam up shortly with Dr.<br> Korby and party.<br> Security, Spock here.<br> Status of the landing party.<br> Ready and standing by, sir, Meet me in the transporter room after the captain has beamed down.<br> I looked it over.<br> I think you'll find planet Midas Five an excellent choice.<br> A small colony.<br> Abundant raw materials.<br> You made a good beginning, Captain.<br> Thank you.<br> I felt quite at home on the Enterprise.<br> Andrea kiss me.<br> No.<br> Not programmed for you.<br> What's the matter, Andrea? Confused? No.<br> Emotion, Ruk? You disapprove of Miss Chapel's orders to save my life.<br> To maintain your existence would be illogical.<br> Why? Can't your memory banks solve a simple equation like that? What happened to the old ones, Ruk? It's so long ago.<br> Is it possible they built their machines too well gave them pride and a desire to survive? Machines that wanted logic and order and found that frustrated by the illogical emotional creatures that built them? Yes.<br> The old ones.<br> The ones who made us.<br> They grew fearful of us.<br> They began to turn us off.<br> Isn't it Korby who's creating the same danger to you all over again? Unlike you, we humans are full of unpredictable emotions that logic cannot solve.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> It had been so long ago, I had forgotten.<br> The old ones here.<br> The ones who made us, yes.<br> Yes, it is still in my memory banks.<br> It became necessary to destroy them.<br> You are inconsistent.<br> You cannot be programmed.<br> You are inferior.<br> And Korby? You came from the outside.<br> You bring disorder here.<br> The danger to you is Korby.<br> I was programmed by Korby.<br> I cannot harm him.<br> The old ones programmed you, too, but it became possible to destroy them.<br> That was the equation! Ugh! Existence! Survival must cancel out programming.<br> That's it, Ruk! Logic! You can't protect someone who's trying to destroy you! Ruk, I would like-- You brought him among us.<br> You brought the inferior ones.<br> We had cleansed ourselves of them.<br> Now you bring the evil back! Ruk, stop! Your programming.<br> I had no choice.<br> You were a man with respect for all things alive.<br> How can I explain the change in you? If I told Earth I was in your hands-- [Static] It's still me, Christine.<br> Roger.<br> I'm in here.<br> You can't imagine how it was.<br> I was frozen Dying.<br> My legs were gone.<br> I was I had only my brain between life and death.<br> This can be repaired-- easier than another man can set a broken finger.<br> I'm still the same as I was before, Christine, perhaps even better.<br> Are you, Roger? [Alarm Beeping] Andrea.<br> Yes, Doctor.<br> There's someone in the outer junction.<br> Spock.<br> He must've got my message.<br> I will find Ruk.<br> He'll never find us in this maze.<br> Ruk has been shut off.<br> Get a weapon.<br> Deal with it.<br> Protect.<br> I will kiss you.<br> No.<br> You You will not? It is illogical.<br> I'm the same! A direct transfer.<br> All of me, human, rational, and without a flaw.<br> He freed himself, and I destroyed-- Destroyed him.<br> I'mnot programmed for alarms.<br> I listened to your instructions.<br> They were misstated.<br> She killed the android like you killed Ruk.<br> Is this your perfect world, your flawless beings killing off one another? Aren't you doing exactly what you hate in humans, killing with no more concern than turning off a light? I'm not a computer.<br> Test me.<br> Ask me to solve any-- Equate-- Transmi-- Christine, Christine, Iet me prove myself.<br> Does this make such a difference? Don't you see, Roger? Everything you've done has proved it isn't you.<br> I am Roger Korby! Then prove it.<br> Give me that phaser gun.<br> If there's any human left in you, give it to me.<br> No.<br> You will never understand.<br> I constructed a perfect being, tested it, proved it.<br> Proved it.<br> Proved it.<br> Andrea, give me the weapon.<br> No.<br> Protect.<br> Protect.<br> To love you.<br> To To kiss you.<br> No.<br> You cannot love.<br> You're not human.<br> Love you Kiss Captain Kirk! In here, Spock.<br> Captain, are you all right? Nurse? Where's Dr.<br> Korby? Dr.<br> Korby was never here.<br> Thank you for letting me make the decision, Captain.<br> I'm quite certain I'm doing the right thing.<br> She's staying with the ship.<br> Something bothering you, Mr.<br> Spock? Frankly, I was rather dismayed by your use of the term \"half-breed,\" Captain.<br> You must admit it is an unsophisticated expression.<br> I'll remember that, Mr.<br> Spock, the next time I find myself in a similar situation.<br> Steady as we go, helm.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Take the guards.<br> Have a look outside.<br> Radioactive readings, chemical pollution, any further sign of life.<br> Right, Captain.<br> I wonder what happened to her that she should be so terrified of us.<br> [Tricorder Whines] But I remember the things you Grups did-- burning, yelling, hurting people.<br> We didn't do anything like that.<br> You're not going to hurt? Well, of course not.<br> We're here to help.<br> Grups don't help.<br> But we will.<br> What happened here? Where is everybody? You know.<br> No, I don't.<br> Won't you tell me? You got a foolie, is that it? You want me to play, but I can't.<br> - I don't know the rules.<br> - Foolie? A game, you know.<br> I can't play a game without rules.<br> Even Grups ought to know that.<br> - What are Grups? - You are.<br> They will, when Onlies get old.<br> Grownups.<br> You said something about theGrups doing bad things-- yelling, hurting, burning.<br> That was when they started to get sick in the before time.<br> We hid, then they were gone.<br> Am I doing all right? You're doing fine.<br> You said the Grups got sick.<br> Is that why there aren't any of them around? Yes.<br> They died, but that was after the awful things.<br> A plague, Captain.<br> That could explain a lot of it.<br> But what about the children, theOnlies? Didn't the awful things affect them? Of course not.<br> We're here, aren't we? More of you? How many? All there are.<br> - What's your name? - Miri.<br> Miri pretty name for a pretty young woman.<br> Pretty?

Yes, I know that.<br> Them and their pills and things.<br> - Take me there? - That's a bad place.<br> It's important.<br> Please? All right.<br> Do you have a name, too? Yes.<br> It's Jim.<br> I like that name.<br> Good.<br> I like yours, too.<br> I like you.<br> Do you, really? I wouldn't lie to you.<br> I wouldn't lie to you, either,Jim.<br> I remember the Grups, but you're nice.<br> You're different.<br> Why, thankyou.<br> It's already starting.<br> I knew it would.<br> Just like it did with the Grups.<br> It'll spread all overyou, and you'll yell.<br> You'll try to hurt everybody.<br> Then you'll die.<br> I knew it would! I knew it would! Captain's Log, stardate 2713.<br>6.<br> The building Miriledus to also housed an automatic transmission station, which sent out the signals that drewus to this planet.<br> We also discovered something else-- that the blues plotches, characteristic of the unknown disease had appearedon each of us, with the exception of Mr.<br> Spock.<br> There wasa well-equipped laborator in the building.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy took tissue samples of each of us in an attempt to isolate the organism responsible.<br> A veritable zoo of bacteria.<br> Beam down a biocomputer and a portable electronic microscope.<br> If I'm dealing with viruses, I'll need better equipment than I have here.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Captain Kirk? - Yes, Lieutenant? I've got volunteers ready to help you, sir.<br> Under no circumstances is anyone to beam down.<br> We can't take any chances with further contamination.<br> - But, Captain, if you become too ill-- - My orders stand, Lieutenant.<br> You can help us best by standing by.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Bones.<br> - Hmm? Why do you think the symptoms haven't appeared in Mr.<br> Spock? I don't know.<br> Probably the little bugs have no appetite for green blood.<br> Being a red-blooded human obviously has its disadvantages.<br> There you have a museum piece, Doctor.<br> Lens type-- manually operated, light-activated.<br> Spare me the analysis, Mr.<br> Spock, please.<br> It is enough that it works.<br> It spreads real fast.<br> I know.<br> When you're old, it covers you like anything.<br> \"lntermediate experimentation report project on life\" \"Prolongation.<br>\" \"Progress report-- genetics section, Life Prolongation Project.<br>\" That's what it was.<br> Life prolongation.<br> Didn't have much luck, did they?

There are certain glandular changes which take place upon entering puberty, are there not? Of course.<br> It changes the entire body system.<br> You know that.<br> Of course you know that.<br> Why? Is it not possible that these children here, as they enter puberty, contract the disease? That would explain why there are no adults.<br> Glandular, postpubescent.<br> It could be.<br> It's illogical.<br> It does not follow.<br> All the adults on this planet died but there are children in the streets.<br> Who die when they enter adolescence.<br> Buthow do they keep the line going? One thing, Captain.<br> If she were a wild animal ever since she's been a little girl, how do you explain that she wants to stay with us? Lone liness.<br> Curiosity.<br> I think children have an instinctive need for adults.<br> They want to be told right and wrong.<br> There may be other emotions at work in this case, Captain.<br> [McCoy] She likes you,Jim.<br> She's becoming a woman.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - [Communicator Beeps] - Spock here.<br> - Here are those figures you askedfor.<br> Metabolic rate--72%.<br> Production of nucleic acids reduced to 33% of normal.<br> Conventional chronological progression--100x3.<br>6.<br> Acknowledged, Lieutenant.<br> I have the calculations now.<br> Try again.<br> See if you can find anything outside.<br> Heyclean up that desk for me, will you? All right,Jim.<br> According to their life prolongation plan, what they thought they were accomplishing, a person would age only one month for every 1 00 years of real time.<br> And only one month? Exactly, yeoman.<br> Evidently through some miscalculation, this virus annihilated the entire adult population in a very short period, Ieaving only the children.<br> But that means these children could very well be immensely old.<br> That would certainly answer the question of what happened to their parents.<br> - Answers it very well.<br> - Children who never age eternal childhood, filled with play, no responsibilities.<br> It's almost like a dream.<br> I wouldn't examine that dream too closely, yeoman.<br> It might not turn out to be very pretty.<br> A few days ago or a week ago that creature that attacked us could have been just like Miri.<br> A child entering puberty on this planet means a death sentence.<br> Do you suppose she knows? - I don't think so.<br> - If they're as old as Spock claims, they must have some idea of what's happening.<br> There's no adult interpretation.<br> I think we're dealing with children, immensely old perhaps but nonetheless children.<br> We've got to do something about the others.<br> We can't even get a glimpse of them.<br> You couldn't get close to the other kids? Impossible.<br> They know the area too well, like mice.<br> I'm going to try.<br> Miri? Come here.<br> - You want to go someplace with me? - Sure.<br> That little girl-- Is at least 300 years older than you are, yeoman.<br> Think about it.<br> Miri is with them! Why? - Why? - What's she going to do,Jahn? I don't--I don't know.<br> I know what we've got to do.<br> There are more of them than we see.<br> Somewhere, up in the sky, maybe, somewhere.<br> They talk to each other all the time.<br> You know Grups.<br> You know what they do-- the hurting, the killing.<br> I remember the way it was.<br> That's right, the way it was in the before time.<br> They talk to the other Grups with these little boxes.<br> Now, if they didn't have those little boxes, they'd beall alone.<br> - Huh? - But they don't see us.<br> We hide.<br> - Olly olly oxen free! - Olly olly oxen free! - Olly olly oxen free! - Olly olly oxen free! No! It's not a game.<br> It's real.<br> They're dangerous.<br> They're Grups.<br> Don't you understand? Jahn! All right! Let's hide! [Thump] [Children Scream] Aah! Aah! Dead.<br> I don't understand it.<br> My phaser wasn't set to kill.<br> Her name was Louise.<br> She was just a little bit older than I am when it happened.<br> Oh,Jim.<br> Data has been fed into the computers.<br> - Standby.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> - Are these enough,Jim? - We could use more, if you don't mind.<br> No, I don't mind.<br> There couldn't be any doubt about what you found here? This fellow made these notes in the last weeks after the disaster began.<br> I disregard these last entries.<br> He said himself he was too sick, too far gone to be sure he wasn't already mad, and I agree, but based on the entries he made before that, I know how much time we have.<br> The ship's computers will verify my figures.<br> Only a matter of time before we all go mad, destroy each other, till the last of us finally destroys himself.<br> What about Miri? Our guess was correct.<br> They contract the disease as they enter puberty and their metabolism changes.<br> The notes indicate it doesn't become acute for a month or so.<br> I estimate she has perhaps five or six weeks left.<br> - What about us? - The older the victim, the more rapid the progress of the disease.<br> And you? The disease doesn't seem to be interested in you.<br> I am a carrier.<br> Whatever happens, I can't go back to the ship, and I do want to go back to the ship, Captain.<br> Of course, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We still don't know what we're fighting.<br> But we know what it is and how fast it works.<br> It's progressing.<br> We'll begin to feel it inside soon-- intense fever, great pain in the extremities, fuzziness of vision.<br> Of course, those are the early symptoms.<br> There'll be more.<br> You're certain about the time we have left? I presume my calculations are correct.<br> - Is there any possibility-- - This is the Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> Computer indicates Verified, Captain.<br> We have seven days.<br> Captain's Log, supplement-- This is the second day of the seven left to us.<br> We've found nothing.<br> Enterprise is standing by with labs and computers ready to assist us.<br> There's no data, no stopping point.<br> I think I've found it.<br> Janice, take Miri for a walk.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Only one half intact.<br> - Do you know what they were up to? - More or less.<br> The idea was to create a new series of diseases-- a chain reaction of viruses meant essentially to extend the life of the human cell immeasurably.<br> Unfortunately, they weren't successful.<br> We've seen the results.<br> You two will have to recreate their thinking.<br> If you can isolate that virus, we'll be able to develop a vaccine.<br> Is that all, Captain? We have five days, you know.<br> - I know.<br> - [Children's Voices] - ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' - The children.<br> ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' - Anything? - No, nothing.<br> And you? [Grate Closes] Communicators, Captain they're gone.<br> We've got to have those communicators.<br> Without them, we don't have the computers, and without the computers, we don't have a chance.<br> Captain's Log, stardate 2717.<br>3-- Three days, seven hours left to us.<br> Investigation proves that the supply of food in the area is running dangerously low.<br> Unless something is done, the children will starve in a few months.<br> The disease is working on each of us according to Dr.<br> McCoy's prediction.<br> Our temper sare growing short.<br> We're no further along than we were two day sago.<br> - Haven't you found a thing yet? - Would you like to take a crack at it? [Glass Breaks] No! No! No! I'm upset, Captain.<br> So upset.<br> Back on the ship, I used to try to get you to look at my legs.<br> Captain, look at my legs.<br> We're all frightened.<br> [McCoy] Jim, I found something! The last slide I examined, I failed to make the adjustment.<br> - The slowing down of my responses-- - What did you find? The disease-- the one they created 300 years ago.<br> - There's a chance! - A chance.<br> At least it's a race now, and we've just wasted a minute.<br> That would be some foolie, Miri, but do you think it would work? I know.<br> I know.<br> Don't you think I've heard them talk? They have such little time to do this dumb thing of theirs-- This baninski thing.<br> If we get her away-- that yeoman-- that's one person less to start off with.<br> But how, Miri, if they're so busy, if they're going to have the big emergency, how are you going to get her away? It's easy.<br> She's always asking me about the youngest Onlies-- \"What if they get sick, who takes care of them? \"Do they have enough to eat? Where do they sleep?\" I'll just tell her one of you fell down and got hurt.<br> - Me.<br> Say it's me.<br> - All right.<br> You.<br> But Grups-- they know things and all that.<br> You know, I bet they'll be able to do it with one person less.<br> Not one-- two.<br> Because he'll try to find her.<br> Who? Who will, Miri? The captain.<br> He'll try to find her, but he won't Mr.<br> Lovey-dovey.<br> Lovey-dovey-- Bunk bunk on the head.<br> Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! - It looks right.<br> - The nitrogen cycle-- it has to be.<br> Yeah, but the question is-- what's the dosage? Hmm.<br> That is a very good question.<br> Where is she, Miri? Where's Janice? What's the matter with you? How should I know? Where is she? Has something happened to her? Don't you feel all right? No, I don't feel all right! None of us feel all right! Can't you see what's going on? Jim, I don't want anything to happen to you.<br> - I've got to find Janice.<br> - That's not all, Captain.<br> We've got to find those communicators.<br> We're trying.<br> We're trying very hard.<br> That's not enough! This could be it, but we can't test it without the ship's computers.<br> - We've got to have those communicators.<br> - This is the vaccine? That's what the computers will tell us.<br> Without them, it could be a beaker full of death.<br> Did you hear them? We only have a few hours left.<br> I don't care.<br> You've got to care.<br> Miri I'm going to tell you something.<br> You, your friends, all the Onlies are going to get the disease unless we succeed in what we're doing.<br> - You've seen your friends get it.<br> - Sometimes.<br> Not sometimes.<br> All the times, Miri! As soon as you start growing up the way you are-- Don't you know why you don't like to play games anymore, why you don't see your friends the way you used to? It's because you're becoming a young woman and the moment you become a young woman, you get the disease-- all of you.<br> That's not true.<br> Itjust happens sometimes.<br> All the time, Miri! It's happening to you right now! - Look at it! It's in you! - No! No! No! Blah, blah, blah! No, you got the wrong game-- A teacher, I told you! Now, what does a teacher say, huh? Yeah.<br> Study, study, study, or bunk bunk, bad kid.<br> - It's not funny.<br> - It's a foolie.<br> What are you going to do with me? You think I'd tell you? [Door Opens] Miri.<br> - You're not supposed to be here.<br> - I know.<br> - Something go wrong? - No.<br> Okay, then.<br> Don'tjust stand there in the doorway.<br> Come on in.<br> - Listen to him.<br> - You listen, Miri.<br> Why do you think I brought him here? Tell them,Jim.<br> \"Tell them,Jim.<br>\" \"Tell them,Jim.<br>\" Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! - Tell them,Jim! - Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Tell them,Jim! Listen to me.<br> Listen to me! No yelling in the classroom! Look at him-- a very bad citizen.<br> This isn't a game.<br> It never was a game.<br> - Call the police! - I'm the police.<br> - Bunk bunk unless you're good.<br> - You're the teacher.<br> I got twojobs.<br> Bunk bunk! [Children] Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Blah blah blah! Listen to me! You've got our communicators-- the boxes we talk into.<br> - We need them to talk to the ship.<br> - Blah blah blah! No blah blah blah! Because if we don't talk to the ship, if you don't help us there won't be any games anymore.<br> There won't be anything nothing-- no Grups, no Onlies, nobody left forever and ever.<br> Captain! Now, listen to me.<br> You've got to help us before it's too late.<br> Let Janice go.<br> Give me those communicators before it's too late.<br> ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah ' ' Nyah yah yah-yah yah \" You've seen your friends change one by one as they grew up.<br> Did you ever see one of them not change? One by one, they got the disease, and they became like-- Iike those creatures you're afraid of-- Iike Louise.<br> They changed and got the disease.<br> The disease I've got, like Miri has.<br> Do you understand what I'm saying? You're not babies.<br> We can help you! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! No, please.<br> No! It's waiting foryou.<br> It may only be a matter of months.<br> Listen to him.<br> He's telling the truth.<br> He's funny.<br> He thinks he's funny.<br> - Bunk bunk! Get him! - Look at my arms! That's what's going to happen to you unless you let me help you.<br> - Bunk bunk! - Bunk bunk! And the little ones what's going to happen to them after you've gone, after you've turned into creatures like Louise? They'll still be here, but not for long, because the food's all gone.<br> You've eaten it.<br> Maybe six months left, that's all, and then nothing left to eat, nobody left to take care of them.<br> They'll die, too.<br> Look at my arm.<br> It's happening to me.<br> - He's telling the truth.<br> - They're Grups! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! Bunk bunk! You want a foolie? All right.<br> I dare you.<br> I double-dare you.<br> Look at the blood on my face.<br> Blood on your hands.<br> Now who's doing the hurting? Not the Grups.<br> It's you hurting, yelling, maybe killing, just like the Grups and creatures you're afraid of.<br> You're acting like them, and you're going to bejust like them unless you let me help you.<br> I'm a Grup and I want to help you.<br> I'm begging you.<br> Let me help you, or there won't be anything left at all.<br> Please.<br> We can't wait for those communicators any longer.<br> - We must.<br> The vaccine could be fatal.<br> - The disease certainly is.<br> How long do we have left-- hours, minutes? How much longer do you want to wait? Bickering is pointless.<br> I'll check on the captain's progress.<br> Spock! Is he dead, Mr.<br> Spock? Not yet.<br> - 3 hours, 11 minutes left.<br> - Thank you, Lieutenant.<br> Keep this channel open.<br> Clear your computers.<br> - What happened to McCoy? - He injected himself with the vaccine.<br> He was unconscious when I found him.<br> Look at his face.<br> The blemishes are fading.<br> [Spock] They're fading.<br> Who will understand the medical mind? Is this supposed to be a good thing, Miri? Of course it is.<br> They were just children.<br> To leave them there with a medical team-- just children-- I've already contacted space central.<br> - They'll send teachers, advisers.<br> - And truant officers, I presume.<br> They'll be all right.<br> Miri-- she really loved you, you know.<br> Yes.<br> I never get involved with older women, yeoman.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? - Captain?

Thank you.<br> I believe regulations call for me to check my weapon.<br> No, no.<br> That won't be necessary in your case, Captain.<br> Just keep it out of sight, hmm? I know you people feel as naked without a weapon as we do without a medikit.<br> A small toast.<br> Do you mind? It's such a great day for us here on Tantalus when we have visitors, no matter what the excuse.<br> Doctor-- Now, Captain, you made your apology from upstairs.<br> Now forget it.<br> I don't think you'll be able to get through the security screen, Captain.<br> Just a second, hmm? There.<br> Now try it.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> Your landing coordinates were right on the nose, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We arrived safely, and we're here with Dr.<br> Adams right now.<br> Kirk out.<br> Affirmative, Captain.<br> Enterprise out.<br> Ah, Lethe come in.<br> Lethe, this is Captain Kirk and Dr.<br> Helen Noel.<br> Lethe came to us for rehabilitation and stayed on as a therapist, and a very good one, too, I might add.<br> I love my work.<br> Go right ahead, Captain.<br> Before you came here I was another person, malignant, hateful.<br> May I ask what crime you committed? Does it matter? That person no longer exists.<br> Uh, part of our cure, if you will, Captain, is to bury the past.<br> Why should a person go on living with unbearable memories if there's no necess-- I feel quite sure that you'd concur with me in that, Doctor--Helen.<br> A shifting of memory patterns is basic to psychotherapy.<br> Yes.<br> And now to the toast, hmm? You'll forgive us, Lethe.<br> There you are, Captain.<br> To all mankind may we never find space so vast, planets so cold, heart and mind so empty that we cannot fill them with love and warmth.<br> Quite a tour, Doctor.<br> Very impressive.<br> Thank you.<br> Hi, Carl.<br> Doctor.<br> Yes? Hmm? Ah I was afraid you would ask about this, Captain.<br> One doesn't like to talk about their personal failures, you know? It was just an experiment that went wrong, I'm afraid.<br> May I see it? Captain, if something hasn't worked out and therefore has no scientific fact-- Shall we leave it up to the doctor? Since you brought me down here for advice, Captain-- One of the advantages of being a captain, Doctor, is being able to ask for advice without necessarily having to take it.<br> I think I'll have to award that round to the captain, Helen.<br> You're fighting over your weight.<br> All right, let's take a look.<br> SIMON: I'm not a criminal! I do not require neural neutralizer.<br> Neural neutralizer.<br> Can you explain that, Dr.<br> Van Gelder? A room.<br> A device.<br> Door.<br> Control panel.<br> I see it.<br> A device.<br> A light! The light! This room-- what happens there? Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah.<br> A neural neutralizer-- experimental.<br> Actually, we don't expect to get much use out of it at all.<br> That beam from above neutralizes brain waves.<br> It relaxes the patient's mind.<br> Does them no harm, of course, and the effects are only temporary.<br> One question, Doctor.<br> If it doesn't do any good-- Why do we go on using it? Hmm, Captain? Hope.<br> Yes, there's always that slight chance that it might do some good in the more violent cases.<br> Tranquillizers are fine, Captain, but to continually pump chemicals into a person's bloodstream-- Exactly my point, Helen.<br> Yes.<br> Shall we? How does it work? Quite simple.<br> Off/on switches, and the large control here changes the strength of the brain neutralizing beam.<br> Captain you remind me of the ancient skeptic who demanded of the wise old sage to be taught all the world's wisdom while standing on one foot.<br> HELEN: Beam neutralizing has been experimented with on Earth, Captain.<br> I'm not acquainted with this particular style of equipment, but I can assure you that Dr.<br> Adams has not created a chamber of horrors here.<br> I didn't mean to suggest that he had.<br> The reason I asked, sir, was you haven't mentioned where Dr.<br> Van Gelder's injury occurred.<br> Right here, Captain.<br> Yes.<br> Simon was a very stubborn man.<br> He could've sat in that room for years with the beam at that volume or even higher.<br> Or if he simply had someone standing by to snap it off in case he got into trouble, but but no.<br> He tried it alone and on full volume.<br> It's a pity.<br> Thank you.<br> You will forget all you have heard.<br> To remember any portion of it, any word, will cause you pain, terrible pain, growing more terrible as you fight to remember.<br> Can you give us your present location, Captain? KIRK: ln Dr.<br> Adams' study, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Why? Then you're with Dr.<br> Adams now.<br> Affirmative.<br> Captain Van Gelder has made reference to a particular treatment room.<br> The term was neural neutralizer.<br> Yes.<br> He was injured there.<br> I've seen the room.<br> Dr.<br> Adams explained the mistake Van Gelder made.<br> Go ahead, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Anything further? Your Mr.<br> Spock sounds like a very excellent second in command, Captain Kirk.<br> Please tell him to go ahead and speak freely.<br> I have to check in with a member of my staff anyway.<br> - Thank you, Dr.<br> Adams.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Stand by, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Dr.<br> Adams has left with some things to attend to.<br> What is it, Mr.<br> Spock? Van Gelder is extremely agitated, Captain, and warns that you are in danger.<br> Well, that's foolish! SPOCK: Uh, please repeat, Captain.<br> I didn't receive that.<br> Tell McCoy the technical expert he sent along with me insists that any concern is unjustified.<br> According to Adams, Van Gelder created his own problem.<br> He's suffering from neuro-synapse damage, as if his brain were short-circuited.<br> It's no wonder he's having delusions.<br> McCoy here.<br> Received and understood.<br> But we still have some doubts up here, Captain.<br> Can you tell us any more? Not really.<br> SPOCK: When do you plan to beam back up, Captain? Ithink we'll spend the night here, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No! No.<br> No, no.<br> And you will continue to check in every four hours? Affirmative.<br> Kirk out.<br> No! No.<br> No, don't let them! You must warn your captain.<br> No! No! Don't let him stay! Don't let him stay! Don't! No.<br> No.<br> Don't hypo me.<br> Please don't hypo me.<br> I'll try not to fight.<br> I'll try.<br> But you must listen.<br> Warn your captain.<br> Dr.<br> Adams Doc Dr.<br> Adams will destroy.<br> Destroy how? What? Right death.<br> SPOCK: Enterprise log.<br> First officer Spock, acting captain.<br> I must now use an ancient Vulcan technique to probe into Van Gelder's tortured mind.<br> Spock, if there's the slightest possibility it might help-- I've never used it on a human, Doctor.<br> If there's any way we can look into this man's mind to see if what he's seeing is real or delusion-- It's a hidden, personal thing to the Vulcan people, part of our private lives.<br> Now look, Spock, Jim Kirk could be in real trouble.<br> Will it work or not? It could be dangerous.<br> Do you understand? It requires I make pressure changes in your nerves, your blood vessels.<br> You must open my mind.<br> Let me warn you and explain to you.<br> This will not affect you, Dr.<br> McCoy, only the person I touch.<br> It is not hypnosis.<br> I understand.<br> McCOY: Good.<br> The reading's levelling.<br> You'll begin to feel a strange euphoria.<br> Your body floats.<br> Yes.<br> I begin to feel it.<br> Open your mind.<br> We move together.<br> Our minds sharing the same thoughts.<br> [Door buzzes] Good evening.<br> Good evening.<br> What did you think of the inmates we saw here this afternoon? You could've waited until tomorrow morning to ask me that, Captain.<br> I didn't.<br> I thought they were happy, well-adjusted.<br> But a bit blank.<br> Captain, if you're questioning the methods of a man like Tristan Adams-- I'd like to see that treatment room again.<br> You say you're somewhat familiar with the theory behind it? Yes, somewhat.<br> But if you'd simply state any doubts you have to Dr.<br> Adams-- And if he's lying, he'll continue to lie, and I won't find out a thing.<br> The only way I can be sure is to see that machine at work.<br> Or is that too impractical and unscientific of me, Doctor? Well? Coming.<br> What is our name? Who are we? We are Simon Van Gelder.<br> Dr.<br> Adams the neural neutralizer.<br> What did he do to us? He can reshape any mind he chooses.<br> He used it to erase our memories, put his own thoughts there.<br> He was surprised it took so much power.<br> We fought him, remember? But we grew so tired.<br> Our minds so blank so open SIMON: that any thought he placed there became our thoughts.<br> Our minds so empty Iike a sponge, needing thoughts, begging.<br> Empty.<br> Loneliness.<br> So lonely to be sitting there empty wanting any word from him.<br> Love.<br> Yes.<br> Hate.<br> Yes.<br> Live.<br> Yes.<br> Die.<br> Yes.<br> Such agony to be empty.<br> Empty.<br> Lonely.<br> Lonely.<br> So empty.<br> Empty.<br> So empty.<br> KIRK: I have no desire to damage my brain.<br> Can this be handled with reasonable safety? Yes or no? Yes.<br> And will you be able to determine if that beam is harming me in the slightest? Yes, Captain.<br> I know my profession.<br> - Ready? - Mm-hmm.<br> We'll try minimum intensity-- a second or two.<br> Anytime you're ready, Doctor, just for a second or two.<br> We already tried it for that long, Captain.<br> - Nothing happened.<br> - Something happened.<br> Your face went completely blank.<br> Try a harmless suggestion.<br> You're hungry.<br> You know, when we finally get through this, I'd like to locate and raid a kitchen somewhere.<br> I put that suggestion in your mind, Captain.<br> I said simply that you were hungry.<br> Remarkably effective for a device that Dr.<br> Adams was going to abandon.<br> I think we should try this again.<br> Yes.<br> Pick something unusual, an unusual suggestion, something we can both be sure of.<br> At the Christmas party we met.<br> We danced.<br> You talked about the stars.<br> I suggest now that it happened in a different way.<br> You swept me off my feet and carried me to your cabin.<br> [Laughing] Merry Christmas.<br> Captain, if your crew saw you carry me here My crew is sworn to secrecy.<br> But my reputation I mean, just having met like this.<br> Of course it would be different if you cared for me.<br> You want me to manufacture a lie, wrap it up as a Christmas present for you?

No message sent from here.<br> No message received by your vessel.<br> Then I suggest the record tapes have been deliberately changed.<br> A computer expert can change record tapes, say anything, say nothing.<br> Your first officer's former captain is horribly injured at this base.<br> That first officer's the only one who heard that message.<br> He could have requested leave.<br> I would have granted it.<br> Well, that's true.<br> Of course.<br> Who would want to divert us here? There's no trouble in the space sector we're patrolling now.<br> No alien problems.<br> Computer Center.<br> Chief Humboldt here, sir.<br> Have you rechecked all the record tapes on the date in question? Yes, sir.<br> Coulda message have been sent from here without us knowing it? Negative, Commodore.<br> We've checked everything possible.<br> All right.<br> Start checking the impossible.<br> Mendez out.<br> Oh, have I introduced Miss Piper, Jim? This is Captain Kirk, Miss Piper.<br> I recognized the captain immediately.<br> A mutual friend described you, sir-- Lieutenant Helen Johansson.<br> Helen described She merely mentioned she knew you, sir.<br> Oh.<br> You have something to report, Miss Piper? Oh, yes, sir.<br> I'm afraid our investigation turned up very little, Commodore.<br> There is, of course, Mr.<br> Spock's years of service with Captain Pike.<br> Indications of loyalty to this former commander.<br> A Vulcan can no sooner be disloyal than he can exist without breathing, present commander as well as past.<br> We're forced to consider every possibility, sir.<br> Captain Pike could not have sent a message.<br> He's under observation every minute of every day.<br> And totally unable to move.<br> His wheel chair is constructed to respond to his brain waves.<br> Oh, he can turn it, move it forwards, or backwards slightly.<br> Through the light, he can say yes or no.<br> But that's it, Jim.<br> That's as much as that poor devil can do.<br> His mind is as active as yours and mine, but it's trapped inside a useless vegetating body.<br> He's kept alive mechanically a battery-driven heart.<br> There's no way he could even have asked for that message to be sent?

Mr.<br> Spock is with me here.<br> He'll answer all questions.<br> Kirk out.<br> This is Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The ship's computers will handle the helm on this voyage.<br> Course will be set automatically.<br> You will not discuss this with ship's crew or starbase personnel.<br> Do you read? Acknowledge, sir.<br> Stand by.<br> We'll warp out of orbit in one hour.<br> He keeps blinking no.<br> No to what? They've tried questioning him.<br> He's almost agitated himself into a coma.<br> How long will he live? As long as any of us.<br> Blast medicine anyway.<br> We've learned to tie into every human organ in the body except one-- the brain.<br> The brain is what life is all about.<br> That man can think any thought that we can, and love, hope, dream as much as we can, but he can't reach out, and no one can reach in.<br> He keeps blinking no.<br> No to what? They could question him for days, weeks, before they stumble on the right thing.<br> Bones Could this have anything to do with Spock? I don't read you at all, Jim.<br> What I mean is either a message was received It was one of two things.<br> Either someone sent a message diverting us here, or someone lied about receiving it.<br> Could that someone be Mr.<br> Spock? Forgetting how well we both know Spock, the fact that he's a Vulcan means he's incapable of telling a lie.<br> He's also half human.<br> And that half is completely submerged.<br> To be caught acting like us or even thinking like us would completely embarrass him.<br> Someone's interfering with my command.<br> I mean to find out who.<br> If you had the technical know-how, I'd suspect you.<br> But you don't.<br> Spock does.<br> He would not make-- There's a false entry in the log right now.<br> Explain that.<br> I can't.<br> But to question Spock? Me, yes.<br> I could run off half-cocked.<br> So could you, but not Spock.<br> That's impossible.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, report to Transporter Control.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy to Transporter Control.<br> McCoy here.<br> You're needed aboard the Enterprise, doctor.<br> Medical emergency.<br> Well, what is it?

Who said Jim needed a medical rest leave? This call about me being needed aboard-- No call was made.<br> Doctor, I regret they elected to keep certain things from you.<br> Will you come with me, please? What is this, Spock? Captain, are you all right? I see that you're still signaling-- Doctor, one moment, please.<br> Kirk to Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I'm recording you this message, Bones, so there will be no misunderstanding.<br> I'm sorry to have to make it an order.<br> You're not to disturb Captain Pike.<br> Simply take good care of him.<br> Follow Spock's instructions to the letter.<br> Kirk out.<br> Sir, scanners report an object following us about the size of a starbase shuttlecraft.<br> Shall we reverse helm?

The command reports stated Talos contained no practical benefits to mankind.<br> Spock would have some logical reason for going there.<br> Maybe.<br> Maybe he's just gone mad.<br> I keep wondering who might be after us.<br> I keep coming up with the same answers.<br> But I can't be right, can l, Mr.<br> Spock?

Sir, I waive counsel.<br> Further, I waive rights to this hearing and request immediate court-martial.<br> Request denied.<br> May I inquire on what grounds, Captain? A mutiny requires a trial board of no less than three command officers.<br> Since there are only two of that rank available-- Sir, I must point out there are three officers of command rank available-- yourself, Commodore Mendez, and Captain Christopher Pike.<br> Denied.<br> Captain Pike is a complete invalid.<br> I believe you'll find he's still on the active duty list.<br> We didn't have the heart to retire him.<br> He's got you.<br> Whatever he's up to, he's planned it well.<br> Captain's log-- stardate 3012.<br>6.<br> General court-martial convened.<br> Mr.<br> Spock has again waived counsel and has entered aplea of guilty.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, are you aware in pleading guilty that a further charge involving the death penalty must be held against you should this vessel enter the Talos stargroup? I am.<br> Why? What does it accomplish to go there or to take Captain Pike there? I want to know why.<br> Are your comments a part of the record, sir? Yes, it's on the record.<br> Thank you.<br> Request monitor screen be engaged.<br> For what purpose? To comply with the request you just made, sir-- that I explain the importance of going to Talos IV.<br> By asking why, you've opened the door to any evidence he may wish to present-- Apparently what he had in mind.<br> Present your evidence.<br> Screen on.<br> This is 1 3 years ago.<br> The Enterprise.<br> And its commander-- Captain Christopher Pike.<br> Definitely something out there, Captain, headed this way.<br> Screen off.<br> Chris, was that really you on the screen? That's impossible.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, no vessel makes record tapes in that detail, that perfect.<br> What were we watching? I cannot tell you at this time.<br> Captain Pike, were any record tapes of this nature made during your voyage? The court is not obliged to view evidence without knowing its source.<br> Unless the court asks a prisoner why, Commodore.<br> You did ask that question.<br> You mean I was maneuvered into asking.<br> Your evidence is out of order.<br> I contest that.<br> I want to see more.<br> You have that right, Captain.<br> But just because the prisoner is your first officer and your personal friend-- That has nothing to do with it.<br> Very well.<br> Continue.<br> Screen on, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> No.<br> It'ssomething else.<br> There's still something out there.<br> As I stated, gentlemen, this was 13 years ago.<br> We were on routine patrol when the ship's sensors detected something ahead.<br> At first we were not certain what it was.<br> Coming to speed of light.<br> Collision course.<br> The meteorite beam has not deflected it, Captain.<br> Evasive maneuvers, sir? Steady as we go.<br> It's a radio wave, sir.<br> We're passing through an old-style distress signal.<br> They were keyed to cause interference and attract attention this way.<br> A ship in trouble making a forced landing, sir.<br> That's it.<br> No other message.<br> I have a fix.<br> It comes from the Talos stargroup.<br> We've no ships or Earth colonies that far out.<br> Their call letters check with a survey expedition.<br> S.<br>S.<br> Columbia disappeared in that region approximately 18 years ago.<br> It would take that long for a radio beam to travel.<br> Records show the Talos group has never been explored.<br> Solar system similar to Earth.<br> Number IV seems to be Class \"M\"-- Oxygen atmosphere.<br> Then they could still be alive, even after 18 years.<br> If they survived the crash.<br> We aren't going to go, to be certain? Not without any indication of survivors, no.<br> We'll continue to the Vega Colony, take care of our own sick and injured first.<br> You have the helm.<br> Maintain present course.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Boyce here.<br> Drop by my cabin, Doctor.<br> [Knock on Door] What's that? I didn't say there's anything wrong with me.<br> I understand we picked up a distress signal.<br> That's right.<br> Unless we get anything more positive on it, the condition of our own crew takes precedent.<br> I'd like to log the ship's doctor's opinion, too.<br> Oh, I concur with yours, definitely.<br> Good.<br> I'm glad you do.<br> We're going to stop first at the Vega Colony and replace anybody who needs hospitalization and also-- What are you putting in there, ice? Who wants a warm martini? What makes you think I need one? Sometimes a man will tell his bartender things he'llnever tell his doctor.<br> What's been on your mind, Chris, the fight on Rigel 7? Shouldn't it be? My only yeoman and two others dead, seven injured.<br> Was there anything you personally could have done? I should have smelled trouble when I saw the swords.<br> Instead I got attacked by one of their warriors.<br> Chris, you set standards for yourself no one could meet.<br> You treat everyone like a human being except yourself.<br> And now you're tired, and you-- You bet I'm tired.<br> You bet.<br> I'm tired of being responsible for 203 lives, and I'm tired of deciding which mission is too risky and which isn't and who's going on the landing party and who doesn't and who lives and who dies.<br> Boy, I've had it, Phil.<br> To the point of taking my advice-- a rest leave? To the point of considering resigning.<br> And do what? Well, for one thing, go home.<br> Nice little town with around it.<br> Remember I told you I had two horses? We used to take food and ride out all day.<br> Ah, that sounds exciting-- ride out with a picnic lunch every day.<br> I said that's one place I might go.<br> Or I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.<br> You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal, women slaves? The point is this isn't the only life available.<br> There's a galaxy of things to choose from.<br> Not for you.<br> A man either lives life as it happens to him, meets it head-on, and licks it, or he turns his back on it and starts to wither away.<br> Now you're beginning to talk like a doctor, bartender.<br> Take your choice.<br> We both get the same two kinds of customers-- the living and the dying.<br> [Intercom Whistles] Mr.<br> Spock here.<br> We're intercepting a follow-up message.<br> There are crash survivors on Talos.<br> \" 11 survivors from crash.<br> gravity and oxygen within limits.<br> food and water obtainable, but unless\" The message faded at that point, sir.<br> Address inner craft.<br> System open.<br> This is the captain.<br> Our destination is the Talos stargroup.<br> Our time warp, Factor 7.<br> Course computed andon the screen.<br> All deck shave acknowledged, sir.<br> Engage.<br> Screen off.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I'm truly amazed at your technical prowess in some how manufacturing all this.<br> I congratulate you on your imagination.<br> But this is a court of space law, not a theater.<br> Captain, please tell the court this is not imagination, nor some clever photographic record.<br> Are we seeing the actual events of 13 years ago? Yes, gentlemen.<br> On that screen as it happened-- the incredible experience of Captain Christopher Pike on Talos IV.<br> If, after witnessing this, the court wishes to turn this vessel back, I will release this ship to manual control.<br> You're in no position to bargain.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> This man mutinied, stole your ship, abducted Captain Pike.<br> This has gone far enough.<br> We haven't heard the full story.<br> I vote to continue.<br> I vote we do not.<br> Deadlock.<br> There's still one member of the trial board to be heard from.<br> Very well.<br> Captain Pike, it's up to you.<br> Do we continue under these conditions?

Guilty.<br> Of sabotaging the computers of this vessel and locking it on a course for planet Talos IV? Guilty.<br> And of forcibly attempting to transport Captain Pike to that planet? Guilty.<br> Why? Why does Spock want to take to that forbidden world his former captain, mutilated by a recentspace disaster, now a shell of a man, unable to speak or move? The only answer Spock would give was on the hearing-room screen.<br> Spock refused to explain how, but there, before our eyes, actual images from 13 years ago of Captain Pike as he was when he commanded this vessel, of Spock in those days, and of how the Enterprise had become the first and only starship to visit Talos IV.<br> They had received a distress signal from that planet and discovered there, still alive after many years, the survivors of a missing vessel, only to find it wasallan illusion-- No survivors no encampment it wasalla trap set bya race of beings and Captain Pike was gone, a prisoner for some unknown purpose.<br> The images we've been seeing are-- Are coming from Talos IV.<br> You're aware of orders regarding any contact with Talos IV.<br> You have deliberately invited the death penalty.<br> Do you know what you're doing? Have you lost your mind? Captain.<br> Jim, please.<br> Don't stop me.<br> Don't let him stop me.<br> It's your career and Captain Pike's life.<br> You must see the rest of the transmission.<br> Space-- the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds, to seek out newlife and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> The court-martial of Mr.<br> Spock has been convened in closed session.<br> Despite all we can do, images continue to be transmitted to us from Talos IV.<br> Starfleet has ordered no contact with Talos IV.<br> They made no exceptions.<br> You have no choice, sir.<br> I'm sorry.<br> The keeper has taken control of our screen.<br> Do you understand, sir? As you saw before, Captain Pike had been knocked unconscious and captured by the Talosians.<br> Can you hear me? I'm Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from the stellar group at the other end of this galaxy.<br> Our intentions are peaceful.<br> Can you understand me? It appears, Magistrate, that the intelligence of the specimen is shockingly limited.<br> This is no surprise since his vessel was baited here so easily with a simulated message.<br> As you can read in its thoughts, it only now suspects that the survivors and encampment were an illusion we placed in their minds.<br> You're not speaking, yet I hear you.<br> Note the confusion asit reads our thought transmissions.<br> All right, then, telepathy.<br> You can read my mind.<br> I can read yours.<br> Now, unless you want my ship to consider capturing me an unfriendly act-- You now see the primitive fear/threat reaction.<br> The specimen is about to boast of his strength, the weaponr of his vessel, and so on.<br> Next frustrated into a need to display physical prowess, the creature will throw himself against the transparency.<br> If you were in here, wouldn't you test the strength of these walls, too? There's a way out of any cage, and I'll find it.<br> Despite its frustration, the creature appears more adaptable than our specimens from other planets.<br> We can soon begin the experiment.<br> The inhabitants of this planet must live deep underground, probably manufacture food and other needs down there.<br> Our tests indicate the planet surface, without considerably more vegetation or some animals, simply too barren to support life.<br> So we just thought we saw survivors there.<br> Exactly.<br> An illusion placed in our minds by this planet's inhabitants.<br> It was a perfect illusion.<br> They had us seeing just what we wanted to see-- human beings who had survived with dignity and bravery, everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp, the tattered clothing, everything.<br> Let's be sure we understand the danger of this.<br> The inhabitants of this planet can read our minds, can create illusions out of a person's own thoughts, memories, and experiences, even out of a person's own desires, illusions just as real and solid as this table top and just as impossible to ignore.<br> It's Captain Pike they've got.<br> He needs help.<br> If we buzz about down there, we may find their mental power is so great, they could swat this ship like a fly.<br> That entry resisted hand lasers.<br> We'll transmit the ship's power against it, enough to blast half a continent.<br> Engineering deck will rig to transmit ship's power.<br> We'll try blasting through that metal.<br> Thousands of us are already probing the creature's thoughts, Magistrate.<br> We find excellent memor capacity.<br> I read most strongly a recent death struggle in which it fought to protect its life.<br> We will begin with this, giving the specimen something more interesting to protect.<br> Come on.<br> We must hide ourselves.<br> Come.<br> Come.<br> Hurry.<br> It's deserted.<br> There'll be weapons and perhaps food.<br> This is Rigel 7.<br> Please, we must hide ourselves.<br> I was in a cage, a cell, in some kind of a zoo.<br> I must still be there.<br> Come on.<br> They've reached into my mind and taken the memory of somewhere I've been.<br> [ Grrr ] The Kaylar! Ohh! It's starting just as it happened two weeks ago.<br> [ Grrr ] Except foryou.<br> A brilliant deduction by Captain Pike, gentlemen.<br> Yes, he was still inside his cell, but knowing that couldn't help him.<br> The Talosians controlled his brain.<br> And could make him live any place, any time, any situation they wished.<br> He would see, taste, suffer with the same reality as you gentlemen sitting there.<br> Longer hair, different dress, but it is you, the one the survivors call Vina.<br> Roar! Or rather the image of Vina.<br> But why you again? Why didn't they create a different girl? [Grrr] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] Quick.<br> If you attack while it's not looking But it's only a dream.<br> [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] Kill him as you did before.<br> Tell my jailers I won't go along with it.<br> I'm not an animal performing for its supper.<br> What ever you call this, you'll feel it.<br> You'll feel it.<br> That's what matters.<br> You'll feel whatever happens to you.<br> [ Clanging ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] [ Grrr ] Oh! Aah! [ Grrr ] Ohh! Aah! Ohh! Ohh! [ Grrr ] Aah! Aah! [ Grrr ] It's over.<br> Why have they stopped the images? Because they know that Captain Pike is fatigued.<br> We can reconvene later.<br> Then they care about the captain? They want him back alive, sir.<br> I demand to know why.<br> If you'll be patient, the answers-- You're forgetting you're on trial, Spock.<br> You will answer all questions put to you.<br> My answer to your question would be quite unbelievable.<br> I regret we'll have to wait and see it there.<br> Personal log, stardate 3013.<br>2.<br> Reconvening court-martial of Mr.<br> Spock and the strangest trial evidence ever heard aboard a starship.<br> From the mysterious planet now only one hour ahead of us, the story  of Captain Pike's imprisonment there.<br> Why are you here? To please you.<br> Are you real? As real as you wish.<br> No.<br> No.<br> No, that's not any answer.<br> I've never met you before, never even imagined you.<br> Perhaps they made me out of dreams you've forgotten.<br> And dress you in the same metal fabric they wear? I can wear whatever you wish or be anything you wish.<br> So they can see how their specimen performs? They want to see how I react? Don't you have a--a dream, something you've always wanted very badly? Or do they do more than just watch me? Do they feel with me, too? You can have whatever dream you want.<br> I can become anything, any woman you-- you've ever imagined.<br> You can have anything you want in the whole universe.<br> Let me please you.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, you can please me.<br> You can tell me about them.<br> How can I keep them from probing my mind, from using my thoughts against me? Does that frighten you? Does that mean there is a way? You're a fool.<br> Since you're not real, there's not much point in continuing this conversation, is there? All circuits engaged, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Standing by, Number One.<br> Take cover.<br> Increase to full power! Can you give us any more? Our circuit sare beginning to heat.<br> We'll have to cease power.<br> Disengage.<br> The top of that knoll should have been sheared off the first second.<br> Maybe it was.<br> I tried to explain.<br> Their power of illusion is so great, we can't be sure of anything we do, of anything we see.<br> Perhaps ifyou asked me some questions I could answer.<br> How far can they control my mind? If I tell you, then will you pick some dream you've had and let me live it with you? Perhaps.<br> They--they can't actually make you do anything you don't want to do.<br> But they try to trick me with their illusions.<br> They can punish you when you're not cooperative.<br> Did they ever live on the surface of this planet? Why did they go underground? War, thousands of centuries ago.<br> That's why it's so barren up there? The planet's only now beginning to support life again.<br> So the Talosians who came underground found life limited here and concentrated on developing their mental power.<br> But they found it's a trap like a narcotic, because when dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating.<br> You even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors.<br> You just sit, living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought record.<br> Or sit probing minds of zoo specimens like me.<br> You're better than theater.<br> They create the illusion foryou.<br> They watch you react, feel your emotions.<br> They have a whole collection of specimens, descendants of life brought back long ago from all over this part of the galaxy.<br> Which means they had to have more than one of each animal.<br> Please.<br> They'll need a pair of humans.<br> Where will they get the Earth woman? You said if I answered questions-- That was a bargain with something that didn't exist.<br> You said you weren't real, remember? I'm a woman as real and as human as you are.<br> We are like Adam and Eve.<br> If we-- Ohh! Don't! Please! Don't punish me! I'll die! Ohh! Aah! An Earth woman? You were captured as breeding stock? Why? Just to maintain a supply of zoo specimens? Much more, Captain.<br> The vial contains a nourishing protein complex.<br> Is the keeper actually communicating with one of his animals? If the form and the color is not appealing, it can appear as any food you wish to visualize.<br> And if I prefer To starve? You overlook the unpleasant alternative of punishment.<br> Aah! [ Screaming ] From a fable you once heard in childhood.<br> You will now consume the nourishment.<br> Why not just put irresistible hunger in my mind? Because you can't, can you? You do have limitations, don't you? If you continue to disobey, from deeper in your mind, there are things even more unpleasant.<br> That's very interesting.<br> Now to the female.<br> You were startled.<br> Weren't you reading my mind? As you've conjectured, an Earth vessel did crash on our planet, but with only a single survivor.<br> Let's stay on the first subject.<br> All I wanted for that moment was to get my hands around your neck.<br> We repaired the survivor's injuries and found the species interesting.<br> Do primitive thoughts put up a block you can't read through? It became necessary to attract a mate.<br> All right.<br> Let's talk about the girl.<br> You've gone out of your way to make her attractive, to make me feel protective.<br> This is necessary in order to perpetuate the species.<br> Seems more important to you now that I begin to accept her and like her.<br> We wish our specimens to be happy in their new life.<br> Assuming that's a lie, why would you want me attracted to her, so I'll feel love in a husband-wife relationship? That would be necessary only if you intend to build a family group or perhaps a whole human community.<br> With the female now properly conditioned.<br> You mean properly punished! I'm the one who's not cooperating! Why don't you punish me? First, an emotion of protectiveness.<br> Now one of sympathy.<br> Excellent.<br> You want some coffee, dear? I left the thermos hooked to my saddle.<br> [ Whinny ] Tango! You old devil, you.<br> Uh, I'm sorry I don't have any sug-- Well, they think of everything, don't they? Is it good to be home? They read our minds very well.<br> Home, anything else I want if I cooperate, is that it? It turned out to be a lovely day, didn't it? You're home.<br> You can even stay if you want.<br> But we're not here, neither of us.<br> We're in a menagerie, a cage! No.<br> I can't help if you won't let me.<br> Now, you told me once they used illusions as a narcotic.<br> They couldn't repair their ancestors' machines.<br> Is that why they want us, to build a colony of slaves? Stop it.<br> Don't you care what they'll do to us? In my cage, it seemed for two minutes our keeper couldn't read my thoughts.<br> Do emotions like hate, keeping hate in your mind, does that block off our mind from them? Yes.<br> They can't read through primitive emotions, but you can't keep it up for long enough.<br> I've tried.<br> They keep at you and at you year after year, tricking and punishing.<br> And they've won.<br> They own me.<br> I know you must hate me for that.<br> Oh, no.<br> I don't hate you.<br> I can guess what it was like.<br> But that's not enough.<br> Don't you see? They read my thoughts, my feelings, my dreams of what would be a perfect man.<br> That's why they picked you.<br> I can't help but love you.<br> And they expect you to feel the same way.<br> If they can read my mind, then they know I'm at tracted to you.<br> I was from the very first moment I saw you.<br> You were like a wild little animal.<br> I'm beginning to see why none of this has worked for you.<br> You've been home, and fighting as on Rigel-- That's not new to you, either.<br> A person's strongest dreams are about what he can't do.<br> Yes, a ship's captain, always having to be so formal, so decent and honest and proper.<br> You must wonder what it would be like to forget all that.<br> [ Flutes And Drums Play ] Nice place you have here, Mr.<br> Pike.<br> Vina? That's Vina again, as the green Orion slave girl? [ Mendez ] They're like animals-- vicious, seductive.<br> They say no human male can resist them.<br> [ Kirk ] Strange evidence from thepast, how the Talosians, planning to breed a society of human slaves, tempted Captain Pike with the Earth woman they held in captivity.<br> Ass he appeared to him in many forms, each more exciting than the last, Pike was beginning to weaken.<br> Suppose you had all of space to choose from and this was only one small sample.<br> Wouldn't you say it was worth a man's soul? You all know the situation.<br> We're hoping to transport down inside the Talosian community.<br> If our measurements and readings are an illusion also, one could find oneself materialized inside solid rock.<br> Nothing will be said if any volunteer wants to back out.<br> The women! Captain.<br> Captain No! Let me finish! But we were a party of six.<br> We were the only ones transported.<br> It's not fair.<br> You don't need them.<br> They don't work.<br> They were fully charged when we left.<br> It's dead.<br> I can't make this thing work.<br> What is it? Don't say anything.<br> I'm filling my mind with a picture of beating their huge, misshapen heads to pulp, thoughts so primitive they black out everything else.<br> I'm filling my mind with hate.<br> How long can you block your thoughts? A few minutes, an hour? How can that help? Leave him alone.<br> He doesn't need you.<br> He's already picked me.<br> Picked her? For what? I don't understand.<br> Now, there's a fine choice for intelligent offspring.<br> Offspring as in children? Offspring as in, he's Adam.<br> Is that it? You're no better choice.<br> They'd have more luck crossing him with a computer.<br> Shall we do some time computation? Vina was listed on that expedition as an adult crewman.<br> Adding 1 8 years to your age then-- [ Door Opens ] It's not fair.<br> I did what you asked.<br> Since you resist the present specimen, you now have a selection.<br> I'll break out of this zoo somehow and get to you.<br> Is your blood red like ours? I'm going to find out.<br> Each  of the two new specimens has qualities in her favor.<br> The female you call Number One has the superior mind and would produce highly intelligent children.<br> All I want to do is get my hands on you.<br> Can you read these thoughts-- images of hate, killing? The other new arrival considered you unreachable but now realizes this has changed.<br> The factors in her favor are youth and strength plus unusually strong female drives.<br> You'll find my thoughts more interesting, thoughts so primitive you can't understand.<br> Emotions so-- Oh! Wrong thinking is punishable.<br> Right thinking will be as quickly rewarded.<br> You will find it an effective combination.<br> Captain-- No.<br> No.<br> Don't help me.<br> I have to concentrate.<br> They can't read through hate.<br> Hold still, or I'll-- You hold still, or I'll-- Don't hurt them.<br> They don't mean to be evil.<br> I've had some samples of how good they are.<br> [ Grrrr ] You stop this illusion, or I'll twist your head off.<br> All right.<br> Now, you try one more illusion, you try anything at all, and I'll breakyour neck.<br> Your ship release me, or we'll destroy it.<br> He's not bluffing, Captain.<br> They can make your crew work the wrong controls or push any button it takes to destroy your ship.<br> I'll gamble you're too intelligent to kill for no reason at all.<br> On the other hand, I've got a reason.<br> I bet you've created an illusion this laser is empty.<br> I think it blasted a hole that you keep us from seeing.<br> Want me to test my theory out on your head? Captain.<br> Seems the Talosians have deserted you.<br> Gentlemen, a moment, please.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock? May I have your verdict? Signal you want them to wait.<br> Captain, please.<br> It's your life now at least a chance for life.<br> You keep talking about life, a chance for life.<br> How? As a prisoner, caged, a zoo specimen, living the illusions that amuse his keepers? No, Captain.<br> there's more to it.<br> Watch.<br> Guilty, yes or no, Captain? Yes.<br> I must also vote guilty as charged.<br> And you, Captain? Guilty as charged.<br> Security control affirmative.<br> Stand to, forward phaser.<br> Aft scanner to bridge.<br> Bridge to commander.<br> Mendez here.<br> Sir, we're entering orbit Talos IV.<br> Talos controls the vessel now, sir, as they did 13 years ago.<br> You've asked me why.<br> You'll see the answer now.<br> Make contact, Number One.<br> They kept us from seeing this, too.<br> We cut through and never knew it.<br> Captain.<br> As you see, your attempt to escape accomplished nothing.<br> I want to contact our ship.<br> You're now on the surface where we wished you to be.<br> With the female of your choice, you will now begin carefully guided lives.<br> And start by burying you? That is your choice.<br> To help you reclaim the planet's surface, our zoological gardens will furnish a variety of plant life.<br> I'll make a deal with you.<br> You and your life for the lives of these two Earth women.<br> Show proof our ship's all right, send these two back, and I'll stay with Vina.<br> It's wrong to create a race of humans to live as slaves.<br> Is this a deception? Do you intend to destroy yourselves? What's that? The weapon is building up an overload, a forced chamber explosion.<br> You still have time to get underground.<br> Well, go on! Just to show you how primitive humans are, Talosian, you go with her.<br> If--if you all think it's this important, then I can't go, either.<br> I suppose if they have one human being, they might try again.<br> Wait.<br> Their method of storing records is crude and consumed much time.<br> Are you prepared to assimilate it? We had not believed this possible.<br> The customs and history of your race show a unique hatred of captivity.<br> Even when it's pleasant and benevolent, you prefer death.<br> This makes you too violent and dangerous a species for our needs.<br> He means that they can't use you.<br> You're free to go back to the ship.<br> And that's it.<br> No apologies you captured one of us, threatened all of us.<br> Your unsuitability has condemned the Talosian race to eventual death.<br> Is this not sufficient? No other specimen has shown your adaptability.<br> You were our last hope.<br> But wouldn't some form of trade mutual cooperation Your race would learn our power of illusion and destroy it self, too.<br> [ Intercom Whistles ] Captain, we have transporter control now.<br> Let's get back to the ship.<br> I can't.<br> I can't go with you.<br> Sir, it just came on.<br> [ Intercom Whistles ] Mr.<br> Spock here.<br> All power has come on.<br> The helm is answering to control.<br> The captain.<br> You see why I can't go with you.<br> This is the female's true appearance.<br> They found me in the wreckage, dying, a lump of flesh.<br> They rebuilt me.<br> Everything works.<br> But they had never seen a human.<br> They had no guide for putting me back together.<br> It was necessary to convince you her desire to stay is an honest one.<br> You'll give her back her illusion of beauty? And more.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the system is coming on again.<br> What's happened to Vina? Isn't she coming with us? No.<br> No, and I agreed with her reasons.<br> All decks prepare for hyperdrive.<br> All decks are ready, sir.<br> Engage.<br> Commodore, don't you think that-- What you now seem to hear, Captain Kirk, are my thought transmissions.<br> The commodore was never aboard your vessel.<br> His presence there and in the shuttlecraft was an illusion.<br> Mr.<br> Spock had related to us your strength of will.<br> It was thought the fiction of a court-martial would divert you from too soon regaining control of your vessel.<br> Captain Pike is welcome to spend the rest of his life with us, unfettered by his physical body.<br> The decision is yours and his.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, even if regulations are explicit, you could have come to me and explained.<br> Ask you to face the death penalty, too? One of us was enough, Captain.<br> [ Intercom Whistles ] Yes.<br> [ Uhura ] Message from Starbase 11, sir.<br> \"Received images from Talos IV.<br> \"In view of historic importance of Captain Pike\" \"in space exploration,\" \"GeneraI Order 7 prohibiting contact Talos IV\" \"issuspended this occasion.<br>\" \"No action contemplated against Spock.<br>\" \"Proceed as you think best.<br>\" \"Signed, Mendez,J.<br>I.<br>, Commodore, Starbase 11.<br> \" Chris do you want to go there?

I'm the captain.<br> I didn't think we'd be meeting again so soon.<br> You probably wouldn't believe me if I told you I arranged it.<br> No, but it's a delightful thought.<br> Captain, we need your help.<br> We've been stranded.<br> It seems that our transportation has canceled out on us.<br> Can't you make other arrangements? Well, yes, but not in time.<br> Our schedule is like a chain-- one break, and it all collapses.<br> Be a shame if that happened.<br> If ever we needed a good Samaritan.<br> Well, l I appeal to you.<br> The regulations are very clear about taking on passengers.<br> I'll make a bargain with you.<br> What have you got to trade?

He's a fine young officer.<br> He's bound to consider this transfer a disciplinary action.<br> I don't wish to discuss it.<br> Please follow my orders.<br> When the man on top walks along his street, the chain of command is often a noose.<br> Spare me your philosophical metaphors, Doctor.<br> The captain is acting strangely.<br> I'm asking if you've noticed.<br> Negative.<br> This is the first time in a week I've had time for a drop.<br> Would you care for a drink, Mr.<br> Spock? My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.<br> Oh.<br> Now I know why they were conquered.<br> What are you worried about? Jim generally knows what he's doing.<br> It was illogical for him to bring those players aboard.<br> Illogical? Did you get a look at that Juliet? That's a pretty exciting creature.<br> Of course your, uh, personal chemistry would prevent you from seeing that.<br> Did it ever occur to you that he might like the girl? It occurred.<br> I dismissed it.<br> You would.<br> Did you know that he suddenly transferred Riley to engineering? Lots of things go on here that I don't know, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> He's the captain.<br> He can transfer whoever he pleases.<br> You can look that up in a hundred volumes of space regulations somewhere.<br> Come on.<br> Have a drink.<br> No, thank you.<br> Well, you're welcome.<br> But I will.<br> And please, Mr.<br> Spock, if you won't join me, don't disapprove of me.<br> At least not until you've tried it, huh? This is the, uh, observation deck.<br> That's the flight deck down there-- with the shuttle craft.<br> Interesting.<br> Isn't it? Tell me, Captain Kirk.<br> Anything.<br> Did you order the soft lights especially for the occasion? If I had ordered soft lights, I'd also have arranged for music and flowers.<br> Unfortunately, it isn't so.<br> On the Enterprise, we try to duplicate earth conditions of night and day as closely as possible.<br> Star light, star bright.<br> I wish I may, I wish I might.<br> Do you remember that, Captain? It's very old.<br> Almost as old as the stars themselves.<br> And this ship.<br> All this power surging and throbbing, yet under control.<br> Are you like that, Captain? All this power at your command, the decisions that you have to make Come from a very human source.<br> Are you, Captain? Human? You can count on it.<br> Tell me about the women in your world.<br> I'd rather talk about you.<br> You must have wanted to perform since you first saw your father act.<br> When? In the beginning.<br> Tell me about it.<br> That's not fair.<br> You haven't answered my question about the women.<br> What would you like to know? Has the machine changed them? Made them just people instead of women? Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman always remains a woman.<br> All this and power, too.<br> The Caesar of the stars and the Cleopatra to worship him.<br> Librarcomputer.<br> Full personal dossiers on the following names-- Dr.<br> Thomas Leighton, Anton Karidian, Lieutenant Kevin Riley.<br> And Captain James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Accomplished.<br> Standing by.<br> Correlate.<br> Check their past histories.<br> Report any item, any past episode or experience they all have in common.<br> Affirmative.<br> I appreciate whatever concern you may have for the ship's company, Mr.<br> Spock-- I will continue, Doctor.<br> According to our library banks, it started on the Earth colony of Tarsus 4.<br> The food supply was attacked by an exotic fungus.<br> There were over 8,000 colonists and virtually no food.<br> And that was when Governor Kodos seized full power and declared emergency martial law.<br> I've heard of it.<br> You may not have heard it all.<br> Kodos began to separate the colonists.<br> Some would live, be rationed whatever food was left.<br> The remainder would be immediately put to death.<br> Apparently he had his own theories of eugenics.<br> Unfortunately, he wasn't the first.<br> Perhaps not.<br> But he was certainly among the most ruthless, to decide arbitrarily who would survive, using his own personal standards, and then to implement his decision without mercy.<br> Children watching their parents die.<br> Whole families destroyed.<br> Over 4,000 people.<br> They died quickly, without pain, but they died.<br> Relief arrived, but too late to prevent the executions.<br> And Kodos, there never was a positive identification of his body.<br> What's Karidian to do with it? His history begins almost to the day where Kodos disappeared.<br> And you think Jim suspects he's Kodos? He'd better.<br> There were nine eye witnesses who survived the massacre who'd actually seen Kodos with their own eyes.<br> Jim Kirk was one of them.<br> With the exception of Riley and Captain Kirk, every other eye witness is dead, and my library computer shows that wherever they were-- on Earth, on a colony, or aboard ship-- the Karidian Company of Players was somewhere near when they died.<br> It's unbelievable.<br> Hey.<br> Rec room.<br> Somebody.<br> Talk to me.<br> Larry Matson here.<br> Is that you, Riley? What's up? Not me.<br> I am down.<br> In the engineering room.<br> You've been a bad boy.<br> Maybe so.<br> Whatever I've done, they're keeping it a secret from me.<br> Hey.<br> Is that Uhura playing? Let me talk to her.<br> I think his heart is sore.<br> What can I do for you? A song.<br> Yep, make it a love song.<br> Just something to reassure me I'm not the only living thing Ieft in the universe, huh? Well, you're not.<br> I'll prove it to you.<br> ' The skies are green and glowing ' ' Where my heart is' ' Where my heart is' ' Where the scented lunar flower's growing' 'Somewhere beyond the stars' 'Beyond Antares' ' I'll be back, though it takes forever ' ' Forever is just a day ' 'Forever is just another journey' ' Tomorrow a stop along the way' 'Andlet theyears go fading' ' Where my heart is ' ' Where my heart is' ' Where my love eternalis' ' Waiting' 'Somewhere' 'Beyond the stars' 'Beyond Antares\" How'd you like that, Riley? [Gags] [Gags] [Coughs] Help me please.<br> [Glass Shatters] You've got to pull him through.<br> I'm not sure I can.<br> If he dies, the only one who'll be able to identify Kodos is the captain, and he'll be the next target.<br> Captain's log-- stardate 2819.<br>1.<br> Ship's officer Riley's condition worsening.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy making lab analysis to determine cause and antidote.<br> Entire crew deeply concerned.<br> As of this date, lab report indicates presence of appreciable amount of tetralubisol, a highly volatile lubricant in use aboard ship.<br> Someone tried to poison him.<br> Tetralubisol's a milky substance.<br> Someone could have gotten careless and made a mistake.<br> I don't believe that.<br> Neither do you.<br> I want the captain to see that report.<br> When I've finished logging it.<br> Now.<br> All right.<br> [Buzzer] Come.<br> My report on Lieutenant Riley.<br> Will he make it? He's got a good chance.<br> We predict the same foryou.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Let's have it.<br> Lieutenant Riley was a witness.<br> So were you.<br> [Sighs] All right.<br> Someone tried to kill him.<br> Could have been an accident.<br> You should be told the difference between empiricism and stubbornness, Doctor.<br> I checked with the library computer as you did.<br> I got the same information.<br> Aren't you out of line? My personal business-- It's my business when it might interfere with this ship's operation.<br> That happened? It could.<br> I don't like anyone meddling in my private affairs.<br> Jim, Spock's simply trying-- I know what he's doing.<br> It's his job.<br> You know it.<br> And you also know that nothing is proven.<br> Even in this corner of the galaxy, Captain, two plus two equals four.<br> Certainly an attempt will be made to kill you.<br> Why do you invite death? I'm not.<br> I'm interested in justice.<br> Are you? Are you sure it's not vengeance? No, I'm not sure.<br> I wish I was.<br> I've done things I've never done before.<br> I've placed my command in jeopardy.<br> I've got to determine whether or not Karidian is Kodos.<br> He is.<br> You sound certain.<br> I wish I could be.<br> Before I accuse a man of that, I've got to be.<br> I saw him once, Men change.<br> Memory changes.<br> I look at him now, he's an actor.<br> It'll change his appearance.<br> No.<br> Logic is not enough.<br> I've got to feel my way, make absolutely sure.<br> What if you decide he is Kodos? What then? Do you play God, carry his head through the corridors in triumph? That won't bring back the dead,Jim.<br> No.<br> But they may rest easier.<br> Dr.<br> Leighton was murdered while the Karidian Company was on Planet Q An attempt's been made against Riley while the company is on board the Enterprise.<br> Doc isn't sure there was a murder attempt.<br> Besides, I have an idea-- Shh.<br> Listen.<br> [Humming] Do you hear it? That low hum.<br> A phaser.<br> On overload.<br> [Humming] This is the captain.<br> There's a phaser on overload.<br> If it blows, it'll take out the entire deck.<br> Evacuate all personnel in this quadrant.<br> Double red alert.<br> [Siren] You get out of here.<br> You can't stay.<br> Go on.<br> Block off this section.<br> Hurry.<br> I'll find it.<br> Evacuate this section.<br> Seal it off.<br> Clear section C4 and C5.<br> [Explosion] [Siren Stops] [Door Opens] We're overdue for our talk, aren't we? I had hoped you would have respected my privacy, Captain.<br> A moment ago, we narrowly averted an explosion which would have destroyed several decks of this ship.<br> Before that, someone tried to poison one of my crewmen.<br> I am sorry to hear that.<br> I'm sure you are.<br> Are you Kodos? I asked you a question.<br> Do you believe that I am? I do.<br> Then I am Kodos, if it pleases you to believe so.<br> I am an actor.<br> I play many parts.<br> You're an actor now.<br> What were you Younger, Captain.<br> Much younger.<br> So was I.<br> But I remember.<br> Let's see if you do.<br> Read this into that communicator on the wall.<br> It will be recorded and compared to a Kodos voice film we have in our files.<br> The test is virtually infallible.<br> It will tell us whether you're Karidian or Kodos the Executioner.<br> Ready for voice test.<br> Disguising your voice will make no difference.<br> \"The revolution \"is successful, \"but survival depends on drastic measures.<br> \"Your continued existence \"represents a threat to the well-being of society.<br> \"Your lives means slow death \"to the more valued members of the colony.<br>\" Therefore I have no alternative but to sentence you to death.<br> Your execution is so ordered.<br> Signed, Kodos, governor of Tarsus 4.<br> I remember the words.<br> I wrote them down.<br> You said them like you knew them.<br> You hardly glanced at the paper.<br> I learn my parts very quickly.<br> Are you sure you didn't act this role out in front of an audience whom you blasted out of existence without mercy? I find your use of the word mercy strangely inappropriate, Captain.<br> Here you stand, the perfect symbol of our technical society-- mechanized, electronicized and not very human.<br> You've done away with humanity, the striving of man to achieve greatness through his own resources.<br> We've armed man with tools.<br> Striving for greatness continues.<br> But Kodos-- Kodos, whoever he was-- Or is.<br> Or is.<br> Kodos made a decision of life and death.<br> Some had to die that others might live.<br> You're a man of decision, Captain.<br> You ought to understand that.<br> All I understand is that 4,000 people were needlessly butchered.<br> In order to save And if the supply ships hadn't come earlier than expected, this Kodos of yours might have gone down in history as a great hero.<br> But he didn't.<br> And history has made its judgment.<br> If you're so sure that I'm Kodos, why not kill me now? Let bloody vengeance take its final course! And see what difference it makes to this universe of yours.<br> Those are beautiful words, well acted.<br> They change nothing.<br> No, I suppose not.<br> They're merely tools, Iike this ship of yours.<br> There are no previous records to Anton Karidian prior to Blood thins.<br> The body fails.<br> One is finally grateful for a failing memory.<br> I no longer treasure life, not even my own.<br> I am tired! The past is a blank.<br> Did you get everything you wanted, Captain Kirk? If I had gotten everything I wanted you might not walk out of this room alive.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> You better rest now.<br> There's a stain of cruelty on your shining armor, Captain.<br> You could have spared him and me.<br> You talked of using tools.<br> I was a tool, wasn't l? A tool to use against my father.<br> In the beginning perhaps.<br> But later, I wanted it to be more than that.<br> Later.<br> Everything's always later.<br> Later.<br> Latest.<br> Too late.<br> Too late, Captain.<br> You are like your ship-- powerful and not human.<br> There is no mercy in you.<br> If he is Kodos, then I've shown him more mercy than he deserves.<br> And if he isn't then we'll let you of fat Benecia, and no harm done.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Who are you to say what harm was done? Who do I have to be? Medical log-- Lieutenant Riley's sufficiently recovered to be discharged, but the captain has ordered him restricted to sick bay to prevent contact with passenger who calls himself Karidian and who's suspected of being Kodos the Executioner and of murdering the Lieutenant's family.<br> Captain's log-- stardate 2819.<br>8.<br> Suspect under surveillance.<br> Strategic areas under double guard.<br> Performance of the Karidian Players taking place as scheduled.<br> [Fanfare Plays] Tonight, the Karidian Players present Hamlet, another in a series of living plays presented in space, dedicated to the tradition of classic theater.<br> Hamlet is a violent play about violent times when life was cheap andambition was God.<br> I believe we have a match, Captain.<br> But not an exact match, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're dealing with a man's life.<br> No machine can make that decision.<br> In the long history of medicine, no doctor has ever caught the first few minutes of a play.<br> Don't forget-- Riley? - Captain Kirk, McCoy here.<br> - Yes, Doctor.<br> Riley's gone.<br> I was recording my log about Karidian and Kodos.<br> If he overheard-- You've made your point, Doctor.<br> Captain, security, \"H\" deck-- The weapons locker has been broken into.<br> One phaser is missing.<br> This is the captain.<br> Security 2 alert.<br> Find and restrain Lieutenant Kevin Riley.<br> He's armed and possibly headed towards the ship's theater.<br> Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, Uncle.<br> No further.<br> Mark me.<br> I will.<br> My hour is almost come, when I to sulphurous and tormenting fires must render up myself.<br> Speak.<br> I am bound to hear.<br> So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.<br> I am thy father's spirit, doomed for a certain term to walk the night Riley get back to the sick bay.<br> He murdered my father and my mother.<br> You could be wrong.<br> Don't throw away your life on a mistake.<br> I'm not wrong.<br> But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison-house I know that voice.<br> That face, I know it.<br> I saw it.<br> He murdered them.<br> Thy soul, freeze thy young blood.<br> It's an order.<br> Give me the weapon.<br> If thou didst ever thy dear father love Get back to the sick bay.<br> Go on.<br> [Applause] It's going beautifully.<br> What is it? What's wrong? There was a voice out of the past haunting me, torturing me.<br> There was another part I once played long ago.<br> I never told you about it.<br> Now that same curtain rises again.<br> The time has come.<br> No, Father.<br> The time will never come.<br> Tonight, after my performance, the last two who can harm you will be gone.<br> What are you saying? There were nine.<br> Now there are only two, and they will be gone as soon as I-- Don't look at me like that.<br> What have you done? What had to be done.<br> They had to be silenced.<br> All of them? All seven? More blood on my hands? No, Father.<br> Not anymore.<br> I'm strong, Father.<br> It's nothing.<br> Second act-- three minutes.<br> We'll be ready.<br> Don't you see? All the ghosts are dead.<br> I've buried them.<br> There's no more blood on your hands.<br> Oh, my child.<br> My child.<br> You've left me nothing! You were the one thing in my life untouched by what I'd done.<br> But you're safe now, Father.<br> I've saved you.<br> Now no one can touch you.<br> Not even Captain Kirk.<br> See Caesar come.<br> He's awed by your greatness your shining brightness.<br> Bright as a blade before it is stained with blood.<br> Bright as a blade.<br> Come with me, both of you.<br> Of course.<br> After the play.<br> The play is over.<br> It's been over for 20 years.<br> I was a soldier in a cause.<br> Terrible things had to be done.<br> Stop it, Father! You have nothing to justify.<br> Murder, flight, suicide, madness.<br> I never wanted the blood on my hands ever to stain you.<br> I did it foryou.<br> I've saved you.<br> By killing seven innocent men.<br> They weren't innocent! They were dangerous! I would have killed a world to save him! Curtain going up-- one minute.<br> The play, Captain.<br> He must go on.<br> This is the great Karidian.<br> Guard.<br> You cannot deny him his last performance! Lenore, don't! Aah! Aah! You'll never get off the ship.<br> Then it will become a floating tomb, drifting through space with the soul of the great Karidian giving performances at every star he touches.<br> I know how to use this, Captain.<br> Lenore, no.<br> Caesar, beware the ides of March.<br> No, child! Don't! Uhh! Aah! Father.<br> Father.<br> O proud death! What feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou, such a prince, at a shot so bloodily hast struck? The curt-- The curtain.<br> The curtain rises.<br> It rises.<br> 'This no time to sleep.<br> The play.<br> The play.<br> The play's the thing where in we'll catch the conscience of the king.<br>' Medical report.<br> [Beep] She'll receive the best of care,Jim.<br> She remembers nothing.<br> She even thinks her father's still alive giving performances before cheering crowds.<br> You really cared for her, didn't you? Ready to leave Benecia orbit, Captain.<br> Stand by, Mr.<br> Leslie.<br> All channels cleared, Uhura?

No identification, sir.<br> There can't be much doubt who's attacking, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, put this star sector on our screen.<br> Now show our position.<br> Signal this to all decks, Lieutenant.<br> All decks standing by, sir.<br> This is the captain speaking.<br> In our next action, we can risk neither miscalculation nor error by any man aboard.<br> Listen carefully.<br> Science Officer.<br> Referring to the map on your screens, you will note beyond our vessel a line of Earth outpost stations.<br> Constructed on asteroids, they monitor the Neutral Zone established by treaty after the Earth-Romulan conflict a century ago.<br> As you may recall, this conflict was fought, by standards today, with primitive atomic weapons and in primitive space vessels which allowed no quarter, no captives, nor was there even ship-to-ship visual communication.<br> Therefore, no human, Romulan, or ally has ever seen the other.<br> Earth believes the Romulans to be warlike, cruel, treacherous, and only the Romulans know what they think of Earth.<br> The treaty, set by sub-space radio, established this Neutral Zone, entry into which by either side would constitute an act of war.<br> The treaty has been unbroken since that time.<br> Captain.<br> What you do not know and must be told is that my command orders are precise and inviolable.<br> No provocation will be considered sufficient reason to violate the zone.<br> We may defend ourselves, but, if necessary to avoid interspace war, both these outposts and this vessel will be considered expendable.<br> Captain out.<br> We know outpost 4 has been attacked, sir.<br> If we intercept Romulans now-- After a century, what will a Romulan ship look like? I doubt they'll identify themselves.<br> They're painted like a giant bird of prey.<br> Is history your specialty? Family history.<br> A Captain Stiles was in the space service, and several officers-- all lost in that war, sir.<br> Their war, Mr.<br> Stiles.<br> Not yours.<br> Don't forget it.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Outpost 2 coming into sensor range, Captain.<br> Outpost 2 was the first to go silent?

This is Commander Hansen.<br> Kirk here.<br> We're minutes away, Hansen.<br> What's your status? Outposts 2, 3, and 8 are gone.<br> Unknown weapon.<br> Completely destroyed, even though we were alerted.<br> Had our deflector shield on maximum.<br> Hit by enormous power.<br> First attack blew our deflector shield.<br> If they hit us again with our deflector shield gone Do you read me, Enterprise?

Negative.<br> It seems to have disappeared somehow.<br> I have you on my screen now.<br> Switching to visual.<br> Tie us in.<br> Tied in, sir.<br> Enterprise, can you see it? My command post here.<br> We're a mile deep on an asteroid.<br> Almost solid iron.<br> And even through our deflectors, it did this.<br> Can you see? Affirmative.<br> What about the intruder? No identification.<br> No answer to our challenge.<br> Only a glimpse of it.<br> Then they fired something at us-- some form of high-energy plasma.<br> Fantastic power.<br> And then the whole vessel disappeared, but it's out there somewhere.<br> Our sensors show that much.<br> Enterprise, something coming on our viewing screen.<br> Lock us onto your screen.<br> Switching.<br> Can you see it, Enterprise?

Negative.<br> You and Mr.<br> Sulu will match its course and speed exactly, move for move.<br> If he has sensors, he should think we're a reflection, an echo.<br> Do not enter the Neutral Zone without direct orders.<br> Acknowledged, sir.<br> Cancel battle stations.<br> All decks-- standby alert.<br> Cancel battle stations.<br> May I respectfully remind the captain what has happened? Romulans have attacked our outposts, killed our men.<br> Mr.<br> Stiles-- It was a sneak attack.<br> Are you questioning my orders? Negative, sir.<br> We could have Romulan spies aboard this ship.<br> I agree, sir.<br> Respectfully recommend all decks maintain security alert.<br> Very well.<br> All decks-- security alert.<br> Security alert, sir.<br> Picking up communications.<br> It's from their ship.<br> Pipe it in.<br> Sounds like code, sir.<br> I have a fix on it, Captain.<br> I can lock on it, get a picture of their bridge.<br> Put it on the screen.<br> Decoding? Cryptography is working on it, sir.<br> Give it to Spock.<br> I didn't quite get that, Mr.<br> Stiles.<br> Repeat it.<br> I was suggesting that Mr.<br> Spock could probably translate it for you, sir.<br> I assume you're complimenting Spock's abilities.<br> I'm not sure, sir.<br> Here's one thing you can be sure of-- Ieave any bigotry in your quarters.<br> There's no room for it on the bridge.<br> Do I make myself clear? You do, sir.<br> Transmission has been cut off.<br> I made a tape of it, sir.<br> Very well.<br> [Transmission Playing] Something visual ahead, Captain, at extreme range.<br> He's changing course, sir.<br> Stay with him, helm.<br> Turning, sir.<br> We grow visible.<br> Attend the cloaking system.<br> It consumes much power, Commander.<br> With no enemy to concern-- That Earth outpost called to an Earth vessel.<br> Which neither retreats nor grows near.<br> It is our judgment we run from a reflection.<br> Perhaps so, but my judgment prevails.<br> Cloaking system on, sir.<br> It is good we approach the Neutral Zone.<br> Not too soon for me to see the stars of home.<br> I know they are following.<br> If an Earth ship, why does he not attack? First study the enemy, seek weakness.<br> If I were their commander, that is what I would do.<br> My commander sent for Decius.<br> A message was dispatched.<br> You've broken the rule of silence.<br> Only to inform our praetor of the glorious mission.<br> Your carelessness might have ended this glorious mission.<br> You're reduced two steps in rank.<br> Take care, Commander.<br> He has friends, and friends of his kind mean power, and power is danger.<br> Danger and I are old companions.<br> We've seen 100 campaigns together.<br> Still I do not understand you.<br> I think you do.<br> You know what happens when we reach home with proof of the Earthmen's weakness, and we will have proof.<br> The Earth commander will follow.<br> When he attacks, we will destroy him.<br> Our gift to the homeland-- another war.<br> If we are strong, isn't this the signal for war? Must it always be so? How many comrades have we lost? Our portion, Commander is obedience.<br> Obedience duty.<br> Death and more death.<br> Soon even enough for the praetor's taste.<br> Centurion I find myself wishing for destruction before we can return.<br> Worry not.<br> Like you, I am too well-trained in my duty to permit it.<br> Continue evasive maneuvers.<br> Now back to the first course.<br> They're turning, sir.<br> We're staying with them.<br> Steady on 111, mark 14.<br> Back on their original course, Captain, toward the Neutral Zone.<br> What's our position, navigator? We'll enter the Neutral Zone in less than an hour, assuming, of course, that we don't turn back.<br> [Scott] We now have aboard debris from outpost 4, Captain.<br> Bring it to the briefing room.<br> Are you ready, gentlemen? From the outpost protective shield-- cast rodinium.<br> This is the hardest substance known to our science.<br> Lab theorizes an enveloping energy plasma forcing an implosion.<br> Comments? Obviously, their weaponry is superior to ours, and they have a practical invisibility screen.<br> You're discussing tactics.<br> Do you realize what this comes down to? Millions of lives hanging on what we do.<br> Or on what we fail to do.<br> The question remains.<br> Can we engage them with a reasonable possibility of victory? No question.<br> Their power is simple impulse.<br> We can outrun them? To be used in chasing them or retreatingsir? Go ahead.<br> I'm looking for opinions.<br> - We have to attack immediately.<br> - Explain.<br> They're still on our side of the Neutral Zone.<br> It's clear they broke the treaty.<br> Attack without a visible target? How do we aim our phasers? Aim with sensors.<br> Not accurate, but-- Enough for a lucky shot before they target us? If we don't, they'll report we saw their weapons and ran.<br> And if they could report they destroyed us? You run away from Romulans, and you guarantee war.<br> They'll be back with everything they've got.<br> You know that, Mr.<br> Science Officer.<br> You've always left out that point.<br> I'm very interested in why.<br> Sit down, mister.<br> I agree.<br> Attack.<br> Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight? Based on what? Memories of an old war? On theories about a people we've never even met? We know what they look like.<br> Indeed we do.<br> If Romulans are an offshoot of my Vulcan blood, then attack becomes even more imperative.<br> War is never imperative.<br> It is for them, Doctor.<br> Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive colonizing period, savage even by Earth standards.<br> If Romulans retain this martial philosophy, then we dare not show weakness.<br> Do you want a galactic war? Captain to bridge.<br> This is Uhura.<br> What's our position? Course unchanged.<br> Estimating treaty boundary in 21 minutes.<br> Are you broadcasting tactical reports? Affirmative.<br> At this distance? Approximately three hours before receiving a reply to our first message.<br> Check our course ahead, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A comet, magnitude 7, dead ahead, and the intruder changing course toward it.<br> Comet lchyrus-4.<br> Composition? Quite ordinary.<br> An ionized mass, a trail of frozen vapor particles.<br> And when an invisible object passes through it It leaves a visible trail.<br> Ah! Our chance, gentlemen.<br> Prepare to attack.<br> All hands--battle stations.<br> I hope we won't need your services, Bones.<br> Amen to that.<br> You're taking a big gamble, Jim.<br> Battle status? All stations manned, Captain.<br> Phaser weapons energized.<br> Set for proximity blast.<br> Intruder bearing directly for comet's tail.<br> Plot his point of entry, Stiles.<br> Computed.<br> On the board, sir.<br> When he enters the comet's tail, he's visible.<br> End run, gentlemen.<br> We'll swing around the other side and catch him at that moment.<br> Acknowledged, Captain.<br> He's maintaining that bearing, Captain.<br> Let's get him, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> How pleasing to the eye it is.<br> Behold a marvel in the darkness.<br> You spoke of entrapment.<br> Its many particles will obscure their sensing device, centurion.<br> We enter it, Commander.<br> Once fully obscured, we will turn suddenly back upon our adversary.<br> The screen is clear.<br> Clear? Our reflection no longer follows us.<br> Escape maneuver one! Quickly! We're losing sensor contact, Captain.<br> Steady as she goes.<br> Phaser crews ready? Phaser crews signal ready, sir.<br> He'll only be visible for a moment.<br> Stand by.<br> Sir he must have-- Guessed our move.<br> Hard to starboard, helm! Hard to starboard! He did exactly what I would have done.<br> I won't underestimate him again.<br> Now, fire blind.<br> Lay down a pattern.<br> Traverse pattern! All phasers fire! Phaser one, fire! Phaser one, fire! Phaser two, fire! Phaser two, fire.<br> Divert all power to weapons.<br> Phaser overload.<br> Control circuit burnout.<br> It'll take time to correct, sir.<br> Captain, are they surrendering? Full astern! Emergency warp speed! - Do we have emergency warp? - Full power.<br> It's still overtaking us.<br> If we can get one phaser working, sir, one shot would detonate it.<br> Navigation? Estimate it will overtake us in two minutes.<br> Phasers, Mr.<br> Spock? Impossible, Captain.<br> Feed this to the space recorder and jettison immediately.<br> Captain, should I continue log entry-- Yeoman.<br> Affirmative, continue log entries.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain It's dissipating, sir.<br> It must have a range limit.<br> impact! Limited range.<br> Phasers operational, Captain.<br> Intruder bearing 111, mark 14.<br> Back to his old course.<br> He may think we're destroyed.<br> I wouldn't make that assumption.<br> I don't think their captain will, either.<br> Intruder holding steady, course 111, mark 14.<br> Same as before, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Stay with him.<br> Commander, the reflection returns.<br> Activate our cloak.<br> Our fuel's low! Quickly! The Earth vessel? lmpossible.<br> It moves as we move.<br> Its commander is not one to repeat a mistake.<br> We'll enter the Neutral Zone in one minute, captain.<br> Do we violate the treaty, Captain? They did, Doctor.<br> Once inside, they can claim we did.<br> They want war, we provoke it.<br> We're still on our side, Captain.<br> Let's get them before we enter the Neutral Zone.<br> Full ahead, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Maximum warp.<br> Ahead, sir.<br> Maximum.<br> Phasers, stand by.<br> At this distance? We know their achilles heel, Mr.<br> Stiles.<br> Their weapon takes all their energy.<br> They must become visible to launch it.<br> A phaser hit at this distance would be wild luck.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> Are phasers ready? Phasers show ready.<br> Commander! Evasive action.<br> The Earth ship again.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, inform command base In my opinion, no option.<br> On my responsibility, we are proceeding into the Neutral Zone.<br> Steady as we go, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Continue firing.<br> Commander, they stay within range! I will tend to the centurion.<br> No need.<br> Centurion is dead.<br> Why don't we fire, Commander? No.<br> No, he's shrewd, this starship commander.<br> He tries to make us waste energy.<br> He has estimated we have only enough It is time.<br> All debris into disposal tubes.<br> Yes, Commander.<br> The body of the centurion, too.<br> Forgive me, my old friend, but I must use all my experience now to get home.<br> Motion sensor signal stopped.<br> Cease fire.<br> Debris scatter ahead, sir.<br> We've hit it.<br> Vessel wreckage-- metal molds, conduit, plastaforms, and a body, Captain.<br> However However? Insufficient mass, sir.<br> What? Simple debris.<br> Not a vessel, a trick.<br> Go to sensor probes.<br> Nothing, sir.<br> No motion out there at all.<br> We've lost them, Captain.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 1709.<br>6.<br> We are at the Neutral Zone.<br> Have lost contact with the intruder.<br> No reaction on our motion sensors, but believe the Romulan vessel is close by with all engines and systems shut down.<br> The Enterprise also waits in silence in hope of regaining contact.<br> Captain, I must make further repairs on the transfer coil.<br> It's giving out again.<br> Work quietly.<br> Now 20 full cycles, Commander.<br> Still no sign.<br> I say he's been fooled.<br> He must have gone on.<br> Shh he is there somewhere.<br> I feel it.<br> Captain's Log, supplemental.<br> Now motionless for 9 hours, 47 minutes.<br> Can I get you something, sir? Coffee, at least? Thank you, Yeoman.<br> Bring it to the bridge.<br> I'll be there in a moment.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I wish I were on a long sea voyage somewhere.<br> Not too much deck tennis.<br> No frantic dancing.<br> No responsibility.<br> Why me? I look around that bridge, and I see the men waiting for me to make the next move.<br> And, Bones what if I'm wrong? Captain-- No, I don't really expect an answer.<br> But I've got one.<br> Something I seldom say to a customer, Jim.<br> In this galaxy, there's a mathematical probability of 3 million Earth-type planets.<br> And in all of the universe, And in all of that, and perhaps more, only one of each of us.<br> Don't destroy the one named Kirk.<br> [Alarm Sounds] It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> A signal, Commander.<br> We have him.<br> Move toward him.<br> Power on.<br> Reverse course.<br> He'll try to slip under us.<br> Lateral power.<br> Coming around.<br> Phasers, fire.<br> Phasers, fire.<br> Commander, how? He's a sorcerer, that one.<br> He reads the thoughts in my brain.<br> Our fuel supply all but gone, and he stays out of reach.<br> We are beaten.<br> Can it be true? The praetor's finest and proudest flagship beaten! Perhaps we can yet save your praetor's pride for him.<br> More debris into the tubes! Decius, do we have the old-style nuclear warheads aboard? Yes, but only for self-destruction.<br> Place one with the debris.<br> Proximity fuse.<br> Yes, Commander, at once.<br> More wreckage across our path.<br> Cease fire.<br> Debris on our scanners.<br> Analysis, quickly.<br> Same as before.<br> Except one metal-cased object! Helm, hard over! Phasers, fire point-blank! Phasers, fire! Glorious.<br> Glorious.<br> Now we go home.<br> They're at our mercy.<br> Commander I remind you of your duty.<br> - Captain to sick bay.<br> - McCoy here.<br> - Casualties? - 22 so far.<br> Mainly radiation burns from the ship's outer areas.<br> Could have been much worse, Captain.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> Report, Mr.<br> Spock? Nuclear device of some kind, sir.<br> Our phasers detonated it less than 100 meters away.<br> - Ship damage? - Mainly overloads and circuit burnouts.<br> - Weapons status? - We've only the forward phaser room.<br> - Fully operable, Scotty? - Yes, sir.<br> But Tomlinson is manning it alone.<br> No standby crew available.<br> Sir, my first assignment was in weapons control.<br> Go.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, take over navigation.<br> Yes, Captain.<br> We have engine power now, Captain, if you'd like to move off and make repairs.<br> No.<br> Maybe we can pull them back to our side of the Neutral Zone.<br> Hold our position.<br> Play dead.<br> Still no sign of movement, Commander.<br> We're damaged ourselves.<br> Our fuel reserve is gone.<br> And it is our duty to crush the praetor's enemies.<br> I do not trust their captain.<br> We are in the Neutral Zone! They will not enter.<br> If you refuse, permit me the glory of the kill, Commander.<br> We will attack but on my order.<br> Damage reports, Mr.<br> Stiles? Negative.<br> Will you require assistance? This time, we'll handle things without your help, Vulcan.<br> Tomlinson! Enemy vessel becoming visible, sir.<br> Forward phasers, stand by.<br> Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire! Stiles! Weapons! Mr.<br> Sulu, prepare to move in on the Romulan vessel.<br> Ship-to-ship, Uhura.<br> Put this on the screen.<br> Hailing frequencies open.<br> Captain, standing by to beam your survivors aboard our ship.<br> Prepare to abandon your vessel.<br> No.<br> No, that is not our way.<br> I regret that we meet in this way.<br> You and I are of a kind.<br> In a different reality, I could have called you friend.<br> What purpose will it serve to die? We are creatures of duty, Captain.<br> I have lived my life by it.<br> Just one more duty to perform.<br> - You all right, Mr.<br> Spock? - Yes, very well, Captain.<br> - And you, Stiles? - I'm alive, sir.<br> But I wouldn't be.<br> Mr.<br> Spock pulled me out of the phaser room.<br> He saved my life.<br> He risked his life after l-- I saved a trained navigator so he could return to duty.<br> I am capable of no other feelings in such matters.<br> How many men did we lose? Only one-- Tomlinson.<br> The boy who was getting married this morning.<br> His fiancee's at the chapel.<br> We finally received an answer from command base, sir.<br> They'll support whatever decision you have to make.<br> It never makes any sense.<br> You both have to know that there was a reason.<br> I'm all right.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I couldn't have prescribed better.<br> We are one weary ship.<br> Think the captain will authorize shore leave here? Depending upon my report and that of the other scouting parties.<br> You know, you have to see this place to believe it.<br> It's like something out of Alice in Wonderland.<br> The captain has to come down.<br> He'd like it.<br> He needs it.<br> You've got your problems.<br> I've got mine.<br> He's got ours plus his plus 430 other people.<br> Where are you going? a flower petal.<br> With these, we can tell the whole planet biology.<br> Oh, my paws and whiskers! I'll be late.<br> Excuse me, sir.<br> Have you seen a rather large white rabbit with a yellow waistcoat and white gloves here about? Thank you very much.<br> Sulu! What is it? What's the matter? Did you see them? See what? I don't see anything.<br> What is it, Doc? Space-- the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission-- to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain 's log.<br> Stardate 3025 uh, .<br>3.<br> We are orbiting an uninhabited planet in the Omicron Delta region, a planet remarkably like Earth or how we remember Earth to be-- park like, beautiful, green, flowers, trees, green lawn, quiet and restful, almost too good to be true.<br> Sir, I don't see your name in any ofthe shore parties.<br> I may be tired, Yeoman, but I'm not falling apart.<br> Dismissed.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Shore-leave party one, standby your section.<br> You willbe called in alphabetical order.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we're beaming down the starboard section first.<br> Which section would you like to go with? Not necessary in my case, Captain.<br> On my planet, \"to rest\" is to rest, to cease using energy.<br> To me it is quite illogical to run up and down on green grass using energy instead of saving it.<br> [Intercom Whistles] Kirk here.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy calling from the planet, Captain.<br> Open a channel, Uhura.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Captain, are you beaming down? I hadn't planned to.<br> Why? Well, either our scouting probes and detectors are malfunctioning and all us scouts careless and beauty-intoxicated, or I must report myself unfit for duty.<br> Explain.<br> On this supposedly uninhabited planet, I just saw a large rabbit pull a gold watch from his vest and claim that he was late.<br> That's pretty good.<br> I got one for you.<br> The rabbit was followed by a little blond girl, right? As a matter of fact, yes, and they disappeared through a hole in a hedge.<br> All right, Doctor, I'll take your report under consideration.<br> Captain out.<br> That's a McCoy pill with a little mystery sugar coating.<br> He wants to get me down there.<br> Afraid I won't swallow it.<br> Very well, Captain.<br> Something I did come to discuss.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock, what is it? I picked this up from Dr.<br> McCoy's log.<br> We have a crew member aboard who's showing signs of stress and fatigue-- reaction time down 9-12%, associational reading norm minus 3.<br> That's much too low.<br> He's becoming irritable and quarrelsome, yet he refuses to take rest and rehabilitation.<br> He has that right, but-- A crewman's right ends where the safety of the ship begins.<br> That man will go a shore on my orders.<br> What's his name? \"James Kirk.<br>\" Enjoy yourself, Captain.<br> It's an interesting planet.<br> You'll fi nd it quite pleasant, very much like your Earth.<br> Scouts have detected no animals, artifacts, or force fields of any kind, only peace, sunshine, and good air.<br> You'll have no problems.<br> Always have to be work with you? So much love liness.<br> You won't find all this so lovely if our report for the captain isn't ready when he asks for it, which shouldn't be long.<br> Rodriguez, Teller, everything all right? Yes, sir.<br> We've completed the specimen survey.<br> That should be sufficient.<br> Beam it up to Mr.<br> Spock and start enjoying yourselves.<br> Sir, I think you'll find Dr.<br> McCoy and Mr.<br> Sulu that way.<br> Thank you.<br> Restful.<br> After what we've been through, it's hard to believe a place this beautiful exists.<br> It is beautiful, so lovely, and restful.<br> I mean, affirmative, Captain.<br> McCoy!

As a matter offact, I do, but this is not one ofthem.<br> Look at this.<br> I saw what I saw, or maybe I hallucinated it, but I want you to take a look and tell me what you think.<br> Footprints.<br> Could be a rabbit.<br> It would have to be an unusual creature to make this size tracks.<br> What about Mr.<br> Sulu? Will he confirm what you saw? Negative.<br> He was examining the flora.<br> [Beeping] Bridge, this is the Captain.<br> Where is Mr.<br> Sulu? Collecting specimens.<br> Bridge.<br> Has the first shore party beamed down yet? They're just about to start.<br> Get this message.<br> Stand by.<br> No one is to leave the ship.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> You're canceling shore leave on account of this? Can you explain this? Well, no, but Neither can I.<br> I admit it looks harmless.<br> Probably is harmless, but before I bring my people down here, I want proofit's harmless.<br> [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] What do you think you're doing? Target shooting, Captain.<br> Isn't it a beauty? Haven't got anything like this in my collection.<br> Where did you get it? I found it.<br> It's a crazy coincidence, but I've always wanted one like this.<br> Found it lying over there-- an old-time police special, and in beautiful condition.<br> Hasn't been one like this made in, oh, a couple centuries.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> It fi res lead pellets propelled by expanding gases from a chemical explosion.<br> I'll hang on to it.<br> The fresh air seems to have made you trigger-happy.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy's rabbit, sir, he must have gone through here.<br> Are you sure our instruments didn't show any animal life on this planet? Absolutely.<br> No birds, no mammals, no insects--nothing.<br> I'm certain our readings weren't off.<br> I'd like to believe this is an elaborate gag, but Yeoman Barrows, accompany Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Find out where those tracks came from.<br> Doctor, come with me back to the glade.<br> I'd like another look at that area.<br> This is turning out to be one very unusual shore leave.<br> It could have been worse.<br> How? You could have seen the rabbit.<br> What's the matter, getting a persecution complex? Well, I'm beginning to feel picked on.<br> I know the feeling.<br> I had it at the academy.<br> An upper classman there-- one practical joke after another and always on me-- my own personal devil, a guy by the name of Finnegan.<br> And you being the very serious young-- Serious? I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end.<br> He's the kind of guy to put cold soup in your bed or a bucket ofwater propped over a door.<br> You never knew where he'd strike next.<br> More tracks.<br> Looks like your rabbit came from over there.<br> A girl's footprints.<br> The young blond girl I saw chase him.<br> Yes.<br> You follow the rabbit.<br> I'll backtrack the girl.<br> I'll meet you around the other side ofthe hill.<br> Good.<br> I got a personal grudge against that rabbit.<br> Jim.<br> Finnegan? I can't believe it.<br> You never know when I'm going to strike, huh,Jim? Ha ha ha ha! How's this? Come on, come on.<br> It's me, Finnegan.<br> All right,Jimmy boy.<br> Ha ha ha ha! Whoo-ha ha ha ha! Lay one on me.<br> That's what you always wanted, isn't it? Come on.<br> Come on.<br> All right, let's try that one again.<br> Come on.<br> Aah! Aah! Go! Any excuse,Jim baby.<br> Run away! Run away! Aah! Run away! Aah! - What was it? - Yeoman Barrows.<br> [Crying] What happened? I don't know.<br> I mean I do know, I guess.<br> I was following the tracks, and there he was.<br> Who was?

Captain, I know it sounds incredible, but I did not imagine it any more than I imagined he did this.<br> Sounds like Don Juan.<br> Yes.<br> Yes.<br> It was-- It was so sort of story book walking around here, and I was thinking, \"All a girl needs is Don Juan.<br>\" Just day dreaming the way you would about someone you'd like to meet.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu was with you.<br> Where is he now?

I like them fine, but all our surveys showed-- Then, offhand, I'd say our instruments are defective.<br> There are indeed life-forms on this planet.<br> Sir, uh our surveys couldn 't have been that wrong.<br> Mr.<br> Rodriguez, have the search parties rendezvous at the glade.<br> I'd like some answers to all this.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - You have to go?

Could be coming from beneath the planet's surface.<br> Patterns indicate some sort of industrial activity.<br> Keep me posted, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We'll continue our investigation down here.<br> Captain out.<br> Feeling better? A little, but I wouldn't want to be alone here.<br> This is a beautiful place.<br> Strange, I'll admit.<br> That's just it.<br> It's almost too beautiful.<br> I was thinking, before my tunic was torn, that in a place like this a girl should be oh, let's see now, a girl should be dressed like a fairy-tale princess with lots of floaty stuff and a tall hat with a veil.<br> I see what you mean, but then you'd have whole armies of Don Juans to fight off and me, too.<br> Is that a promise, Doctor? Oh, Doctor, they're lovely.<br> Look at me, Doctor-- A lady to be protected and fought for.<br> A princess of the blood royal.<br> You are all of those things and many more.<br> They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.<br> Doctor I'm afraid.<br> Now, look, I don't know how or why, but the dress is here.<br> I'd like to see you in it.<br> Why don't you put it on? All right but you stay right there.<br> And don't peek.<br> My dear girl, I am a doctor.<br> When I peek, it's in the line of duty.<br> [Beeping] Calling Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> McCoy here.<br> I, uh I can't read you very well.<br> Is this Rodriguez?

You're the science officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I want some answers.<br> First there was McCoy's Alice in Wonderland where there's supposedly no animal life.<br> And Sulu's gun where there's no refined metal detected.<br> Rodriguez' birds and then my well, the two people I saw.<br> Any chance these could be hallucinations? One hallucination flattened me with a clout on the jaw.<br> That sounds like a painful reality.<br> Yes.<br> There must besome logical explanation.<br> Your signal's weak.<br> Can you turn up your gain? I'm already on maximum.<br> Captain, shall I beam down an armed party? Negative.<br> Our people here are armed with phasers.<br> Besides, there's yet to be any real danger.<br> Captain out.<br> McCoy.<br> McCoy, do you read me? Kirk to McCoy.<br> Come in.<br> Captain, take cover! There's a samurai after me.<br> I mean, there was Captain, you've got to believe me.<br> I've met some interesting personalities myself.<br> Have you seen any ofthe others? Got a call a few minutes ago.<br> Rodriguez.<br> Said you were rendezvousing back at the glade.<br> I hope he got through to everybody.<br> Communications are almost out.<br> That's not all.<br> So's my phaser.<br> Yeah.<br> We better get to the glade.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Look.<br> Someone beaming down from the bridge.<br> Trying to.<br> Something's obstructing it.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No one was to leave the ship.<br> Necessary, Captain.<br> Unable to contact you by communicator, and the transporter is useless now.<br> There's an unusual power field down here.<br> It's soaking up all the energy at the source.<br> After calculating its growth rate, I reasoned we might transport one more person.<br> Good.<br> We can use your help.<br> We're stranded here, Captain? Until we can find out what this is all about.<br> There's no one here.<br> This is where the captain said to rendezvous.<br> I'd swear I heard someone moving around.<br> Don't talk like that.<br> A princess shouldn't be afraid, not with a brave knight to protect her.<br> [Tiger Roars] That way.<br> Spread out.<br> Let's find it.<br> [Hoofbeats] These things cannot be real.<br> Hallucinations can't harm us.<br> Go back to where you were.<br> Aah That doesn't work.<br> He's dead.<br> Captain 's log, supplemental.<br> All contact with the Enterprise has been lost.<br> We're trapped here.<br> Our ship 's surgeon, my personal friend, is dead.<br> We're certain now that whatever we're facing is terribly real.<br> It's my fault.<br> It never would have happened.<br> It's my fault.<br> It is, it is.<br> I'm to blame.<br> Yeoman.<br> We're in trouble.<br> I need every crewman alert and thinking.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Captain!

Still operating, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> What do you make oft hat? This is not human skin tissue, Captain.<br> It more closely resembles the cellular casting we use for wound repairs.<br> Much finer, of course.<br> I want an exactjudgment, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> This is definitely a mechanical contrivance.<br> It has the same basic cell structure as the plants here, even the trees, the grass.<br> Are you saying this is a plant, Mr.<br> Spock? I'm saying that these are all multicellular castings.<br> The plants, the animals, the people-- they're all being manufactured.<br> By who? And why? And why these particular things? All we know for certain is that they act exactly like the real thing, Just as pleasant or just as deadly.<br> [Airplane Approaches] What is it? Of all the crazy things Remember what I was telling you a while ago, about the early wars and funny air vehicles they used? That's one ofthem.<br> Can it hurt us? Not unless it makes a strafing run.<br> A what? The way they used to attack people on the ground.<br> Come on.<br> Angela Angela Captain! McCoy's body.<br> He's gone.<br> Dragged off.<br> The black knight, too.<br> Spock? My analysis may not sound very scientific.<br> McCoy's death is a fact.<br> There is one possibility, very slim, but never the less-- Captain, what were your thoughts Just before you encountered the people you described? I was I was thinking about the academy.<br> My days Hey,Jim baby! I see you brought reinforcements.<br> Ha! Well, I'm waiting for you,Jimmy boy.<br> Finnegan.<br> Finnegan! What's been happening to my people? Whoo, ha ha ha ha Take Sulu.<br> Find McCoy's body.<br> This man is my problem.<br> Captain, wait.<br> That's an order, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Here I am! Yaah, ha ha! Run! \"Jim \" Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Catch me! Can't you see me? Ha ha ha Come and get me! Ha ha ha ha Here I am! You're blind! You never could find your head with both hands!

You officer and gentleman, you.<br> You're a stupid under classman.<br> I've got the edge.<br> I'm still 20 years old.<br> Look at you.<br> Heh.<br> You're an old man.<br> Aah I--I can't move me leg.<br> I can't feel me leg.<br> My back is broken.<br> You've broken me back.<br> Feel that?

You never could take me, you know.<br> Finnegan one thing-- Sure.<br> Name it.<br> Answers.<br> Earn them! Not bad.<br> Kind of makes up for things, huh,Jim? A lot of things.<br> What's been happening to my people? I never answer questions from plebes,Jimmy boy.<br> I'm not a plebe.<br> This is today, What are you doing here? I'm being exactly what you expect me to be,Jimmy boy.<br> Did you enjoy it, Captain? Yes, I enjoyed it.<br> After all these years I did enjoy it.<br> The one thing I wanted to do was to beat the tar out of Finnegan.<br> Which supports a theory I've been formulating.<br> That we're all meeting people and things that we happen to be thinking about at the moment.<br> Yes.<br> Somehow our thoughts are read, these things are quickly manufactured for us.<br> Dangers we happen to think of-- Yes.<br> We must all control our thoughts.<br> The force field is obviously underground manufacturing these things.<br> Passages lead to the surface.<br> When Rodriguez thought of a tiger-- We've got to get back to the landing party and warn them.<br> [Airplane Approaches] Oof! Oh! Aah No.<br> No! Sulu, Rodriguez, Barrows, front and center.<br> Sir-- Don't ask any questions.<br> Face front, everyone.<br> Don't talk Don't breathe Don't think You're at attention.<br> Concentrate on that and only that.<br> Concentrate.<br> Captain.<br> Who are you? I'm the caretaker of this place, Captain Kirk.<br> You know my name? But of course.<br> Lieutenant Rodriguez Lieutenant Sulu Yeoman Barrows, and Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We'vejust discovered you don't understand all this.<br> These experiences were intended to amuse you.<br> Amuse? That's your word for what we've been through? But none of this is permanent.<br> Here, you have to only imagine your fondest wishes, old ones you wish to relive or new ones, anything-- fear, love, triumph Anything that pleases you can be made to happen.<br> The term is amusement park.<br> Of course.<br> An old Earth name for a place where people could go to see and do all sorts of fascinating things.<br> This entire planet was constructed for our race of people to come and play.<br> Play? As advanced as you obviously are, and you still play? Yes, play, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> The more complex the mind, the greater the need for the simplicity of play.<br> Exactly, Captain.<br> How perceptive ofyou.<br> That still doesn't explain the death of my ship's surgeon.<br> Possibly because no one has died,Jim.<br> I was taken below the surface for some rather remarkable repairs.<br> It's amazing.<br> They've got a factory complex you wouldn't believe.<br> They can build or do anything immediately.<br> And, uh, how do you explain them? Oh.<br> Them.<br> Well I, uh I was thinking about a cabaret I know on Rigel II, and, uh, there were these two girls in a chorus line And, well, here they are.<br> Well, after all, I am on shore leave.<br> And so am l.<br> Yes.<br> So you are.<br> Well, girls, I suppose you can turn something up.<br> We regret that some of you've been made uncomfortable.<br> You say your people built all this.<br> Who are you? What planet are you from? My impression is that your race is not yet ready to understand us, Captain.<br> I tend to agree.<br> [Communicator Beeps] Kirk here.<br> This is the bridge, Captain.<br> Our power systems have just come back in.<br> Do you require assistance? Everything is in order.<br> Stand by.<br> - However - Aye, aye, sir.<br> If you would use the proper caution, this amusement planet could be an ideal place for your people to enjoy themselves if you wish.<br> It's what the doctor ordered,Jim.<br> Lieutenant Sir? Commence transporting shore leave parties.<br> Tell them to prepare for the best shore leave they've ever had.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain, I'll go back aboard ship and take over.<br> With all due respect to the young lady, I've already had as much shore leave as I care for.<br> No, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'll go.<br> You-- On the other hand I'll stay for a day or two.<br> Did you enjoy your rest, gentlemen? Yes, wedid, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I think we did.<br> Indeed we did, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Most illogical.<br> Ahead warp factor 1, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Sir, l-- Make up your mind, Mr.<br> Latimer.<br> This indicator's gone crazy.<br> That's to be expected, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Quasars are extremely disruptive.<br> Just how much, we don't know.<br> Considerably, Mr.<br> Boma.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, radiation is increasing.<br> Stop forward momentum, Mr.<br> Latimer.<br> I can't, sir.<br> Nothing happens.<br> Galileo to Enterprise.<br> Galileo to Enterprise-- Come in, please.<br> Ionic interference, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're being drawn right into it.<br> Galileo to Enterprise.<br> Galileo to Enterprise.<br> We are out of control, being pulled directly into the heart of Murasaki 312.<br> Being hit by violent radiation on outer hull.<br> Course, 3.<br>2 by-- Anything at all? Nothing clear, Captain.<br> Just a few words about being pulled off course.<br> Get a fix on the Galileo.<br> Scanners are blank, Captain.<br> We're getting a mass of readings I've never seen.<br> Nothing makes sense.<br> [Computer] Negative ionic concentration-- to the 9th power meters, Radiation wave length-- harmonics--upward along entire spectrum.<br> What is it, Captain? That thing out there has ionized this complete sector.<br> None of our instruments work.<br> At least four complete solar systems in the immediate vicinity.<br> And out there somewhere, a 24-foot shuttlecraft, off course, out of control.<br> Finding a needle in a haystack would be child's play.<br> Space the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission-- to explore strange, new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's Log: Stardate 2821.<br>7.<br> The electromagnetic phenomenon known as Murasaki 312 whirls like some angrblight in space.<br> A depressive reminder tha seven shipmates haven't been heard from.<br> Equally bad, the effect has renderedour normal searching systems useless.<br> Without them, we are blind and almost helpless.<br> I was opposed to this from the beginning! Our flight to Makus 3 is of the highest priority.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> At the same time, I have certain scientific duties I must perform.<br> Investigating the Murasaki effect is one.<br> Yes, but you've lost your crew.<br> We have two days to find them.<br> Two days? ln all that? Two days? What would you have me do, leave them? You shouldn't have sent them in the first place.<br> Captain, there's one planet capable of sustaining human life.<br> Type M, oxygen/nitrogen, and it's listed as Taurus 2.<br> It's unexplored.<br> As far as we can determine with our equipment malfunction, it's just about dead-center of the Murasaki effect.<br> Thank you, Lieutenant.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Set course for Taurus 2.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> You all right? Yeah.<br> Scotty? Boma? Yeah.<br> Now, that's what I call a ride.<br> Yeoman? Yeah.<br>Just a little bump on the head.<br> Upsy-daisy.<br> Thank you.<br> What happened? I can't be sure, but I'd say that the magnetic potential of the effect was-- Thank you-- was such that as we gathered speed, it was multiplied geometrically.<br> And we were simply shot into the center of the effect, Like a projectile.<br> I'd say your evaluation is reasonable, Mr.<br> Boma.<br> What a mess.<br> Picturesque descriptions will not mend broken circuits, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I think you'll find your work is cut out for you.<br> Galileo to Enterprise-- Come in, please.<br> You don't expect an answer, do you? I expect nothing, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> It is merely logical to try all the alternatives.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, a reading on the atmosphere, please.<br> Partial pressure of oxygen, nitrogen--1 40.<br> Breathable, if you're not running in competition.<br> Just the facts, Doctor.<br> Traces of argon, neon, krypton.<br> All in acceptable quantities.<br> However, I wouldn't recommend this place as a summer resort.<br> Your opinion will be duly noted.<br> You're recording this, Yeoman? Of course, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, if you'll make a survey of damage.<br> Logical.<br> I think we should move outside, make room for Mr.<br> Scott to do his work.<br> Mr.<br> Latimer, Mr.<br> Gaetano, you'll arm yourselves.<br> Scout out the area, keeping in visual contact with the ship.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> What do you think our chances are of contacting the Enterprise? Under present conditions, extremely poor.<br> But they'll be looking for us.<br> If the ionization effect is as widespread as I believe, they'll be searching without instrumentation, by visual contact only.<br> On those terms, this is a very large planet.<br> You don't think they'll find us.<br> Not while we're grounded.<br> We may be here for a very long time.<br> Nothing, Captain.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Yes, Captain? Anything on your scanners? Totally inoperative, sir.<br> Have you tried tying in to the auxiliary power? Yes, sir.<br> No change.<br> Transport room this is the captain speaking.<br> Are the transporters beaming up yet? Not 100%, Captain.<br> We beamed down some inert material, but it came back in a disassociated condition.<br> We wouldn't dare try with people.<br> Thank you.<br> This is the captain speaking.<br> Flight deck, prepare Columbus for immediate exit for a search of the planet surface.<br> Correlate coordinates with Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Thank you.<br> Anything, Uhura? All wave lengths dominated by ionization effects, sir.<br> Transmission is blocked, reception impossible.<br> Well, Captain? We have until 2823.<br>8 to continue the search, Commissioner.<br> You don't really think you'll have any luck, do you? Look, these people are my friends and my shipmates.<br> I intend to continue the search for them until the last possible moment.<br> Very well, Captain.<br> But not one second beyond that moment.<br> Is that clear? If it isn't, Iook at book 1 9, section 433, paragraph 1 2.<br> I'm familiar with the regulations, Commissioner.<br> I know all about your authority.<br> Launch shuttlecraft Columbus.<br> [Tricorder Whines] I can't say much for the circumstances, but at least it's your big chance.<br> My big chance? For what, Doctor? Command.<br> Oh, I know you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You've never voiced it, but you've always thought that logic was the best basis on which to build command.<br> I am a logical man, Doctor.<br> It'll take more than logic to get us out of this.<br> Perhaps, but I know of no better way to begin.<br> I realize command does have its fascinations, even under circumstances such as these.<br> But I neither enjoy the idea of command, nor am I frightened of it.<br> It simply exists.<br> And I will do whatever logically needs to be done.<br> Excuse me.<br> Very bad, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> In what way? We've lost a great deal of fuel.<br> We have no chance to reach escape velocity.<br> And if we ever hope to make orbit, we'll have to lighten our load by 500 pounds.<br> The weight of three grown men.<br> Aye, you could put it that way.<br> Or the equivalent in equipment.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, with very few exceptions, we use virtually every piece of equipment in attaining orbit.<br> There's very little excess weight, except among the passengers.<br> Three of us must stay behind.<br> Unless the situation changes radically, yes.<br> And who's to choose? As commanding officer, the choice will be mine.<br> You wouldn't be interested in drawing lots? A very quaint idea, Mr.<br> Boma, but I believe I'm better qualified to make the selection than random lots.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Who? My choice will be a logical one, arrived at through logical means.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, life and death are seldom logical.<br> But attaining a desired goal always is, Doctor.<br> Gentlemen, I suggest we move outside to examine the hull in the event we've overlooked any minor damage.<br> If any minor damage was overlooked, it was when they put his head together.<br> Not his head, Mr.<br> Boma, his heart.<br> His heart.<br> [Thrumming] What is it? I--I don't know.<br> It's from up there.<br> N-No, it's from back there.<br> It's everywhere.<br> It's all around us! Let's get out of here.<br> Aah! Come on, Boma.<br> What was it? It was something huge, terrible.<br> U-Up there.<br> I think I hit it.<br> Did you see what it was? Vaguely.<br> It was like a giant ape.<br> Poor Latimer.<br> At least it was quick for him.<br> We'll get of fall right.<br> Nothing there.<br> I tell you there was.<br> I don't doubt your word.<br> There must be something.<br> I swear I hit it! Folsom Point.<br> Sir? This.<br> Remarkable resemblance to the Folsom Point discovered in 1 925, old world calendar, near Mexico, North America.<br> A bit more crude about the shaft, I believe.<br> Not very efficient.<br> Not very efficient? Is that all you have to say? Am I in error, Mr.<br> Boma? You, err? Impossible.<br> Then what, Mr.<br> Boma? There's a man lying there dead, and you talk about stone spears.<br> What about Latimer? My concern for the dead will not bring him back to life.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> In the interest of efficiency, I don't think we should leave his body here.<br> Bringing him back to the ship should not interfere with our repair efforts.<br> If you need assistance-- We'll do it.<br> Give me a hand with Latimer, will you? Captain's Log.<br>: Stardate 2822.<br>3.<br> We continue to search but I find it more difficult each moment to ward off a sense of utterfutility and great loss.<br> Captain, the Columbus has returned from searching quadrant 779X by 534M.<br> Results--negative.<br> Proceed to the next quadrant.<br> Any word from engineering on our sensors? They're working on them, sir.<br> Still inoperable.<br> What about the transporters? They're still reported unsafe.<br> Thankyou, Lieutenant.<br> Captain.<br> Yes, Commissioner? I don't relish the thought of abandoning your crewmen, however I must remind you-- I haven't forgotten, Commissioner.<br> You're running out of time.<br> I haven't forgotten that.<br> This is the captain.<br> Try using overload power on the transporters.<br> - We've got to get them working.<br> - Aye, aye, Captain.<br> Uhura.<br> Order the Columbus to open its course lap from now on.<br> Captain, 2 degrees means they'll be overlooking more than a dozen terrestrial miles on each search loop.<br> It also means we have a fighting chance to cover the majority of the planet's surface.<br> Mind your helm, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Perhaps if you channeled the second auxiliary tank through the primary intake valve.<br> It's too delicate.<br> It may not be able to take the pressure as it is.<br> This should save us at least 50 pounds.<br> Excellent, Doctor.<br> We should be able to scrape up another 1 00.<br> Which would leave us at least 1 50 pounds overweight.<br> I can't believe you're serious about leaving someone behind.<br> Whatever's out there-- It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six.<br> I'm not talking about rationality.<br> You might be wise to start.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> we're ready.<br> For what? The services for Latimer.<br> Mr.<br> Boma, we're working against time.<br> The man's dead.<br> He deserves a decent burial.<br> You're the captain.<br> A few words.<br> Doctor, perhaps you know the correct words for such an occasion.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, that's your place.<br> My place is here.<br> If you please, Doctor.<br> We may all die here.<br> At least let us die like men, not machines.<br> By dealing with first things first, I hope to increase our chances of staying alive.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> If you'll give me a hand with this conduit.<br> The pressure's dropping.<br> We're losing everything.<br> What happened? One of the lines gave.<br> The strain of coming through the atmosphere and the added load when we tried to bypass.<br> Yeah, that's done it.<br> We have no fuel.<br> That would seem to solve the problem of who to leave behind.<br> Consider the alternatives, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> We have no fuel! What alternatives? Mr.<br> Scott, there are always alternatives.<br> [Bones] Mr.<br> Spock! Something's happening outside.<br> [Thrumming] What do those supersensitive ears of yours make of that? Wood rubbing on some kind of leather.<br> They're getting ready.<br> They'll attack.<br> Not necessarily.<br> It could be a simple tribal rite, assuming a tribal culture.<br> Not a tribal culture.<br> Their artifacts are too primitive.<br> More likely a loose association of some sort.<br> If we knew more-- We know enough! If they're tribal, they'll have a sense of unity.<br> We can use that.<br> How, Mr.<br> Boma? Give them a bloody nose.<br> Make them think twice about attacking us.<br> I agree.<br> If we do nothing, we're giving them an invitation to slaughter us.<br> I'm frequently appalled by the low regard you Earthmen have for life.<br> We're practical about it.<br> I say we hit them before they hit us.<br> Mr.<br> Boma? Absolutely.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy? Seems logical to me.<br> It does, indeed.<br> It seems logical to me, also.<br> But to take life indiscriminately The majority.<br> I am not interested in the opinion of the majority.<br> Components must be weighed-- our dangers to ourselves as well as our duties to other life forms, friendly or not.<br> There's a third course.<br> That could get us killed.<br> I think not! Dr.<br> McCoy and Yeoman Mears return to the ship.<br> Assist Mr.<br> Scott in any way possible.<br> We'll be back shortly.<br> Gentlemen, you'll follow my orders to the letter, firing only when so instructed, and at my designated targets.<br> Now you're talking.<br> You'll fire to frighten, Mr.<br> Gaetano, not to kill.<br> Oh, for You saw what they did to Latimer! I am in command, Mr.<br> Gaetano.<br> The orders and the responsibility will be mine.<br> Follow me.<br> [Thrumming] [Rrraarr] [Rrrarr] The mists, l I can't see them.<br> I hear them.<br> They're directly ahead of us.<br> Several, I believe.<br> Direct your phasers to 2:00 and 1 0:00.<br> - I say we hit them dead on.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> But fortunately, I'm giving the orders.<br> Take aim, please, and fire when I give a signal.<br> Fire.<br> Cease fire.<br> They should think twice before bothering us again.<br> We should have killed them.<br> It was not necessary.<br> Fear will do what needs to be done.<br> Mr.<br> Boma, return with me to the Galileo.<br> Mr.<br> Gaetano, remain on guard here keeping contact with the ship.<br> Did you find them? Yes, we found them.<br> They won't bother us again.<br> I hope not.<br> Scotty has an idea.<br> It's dangerous, but it might work.<br> Go, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I can adjust the main reactor to function with a substitute fuel supply.<br> That's all very well, but we don't have a substitute supply.<br> Aye, we do.<br> Our phasers.<br> I can adapt them and use their energy.<br> It'll take time, but it's possible.<br> Trouble is, they happen to be our only defense.<br> They would also seem to be our only hope.<br> Aye.<br> Yeoman, your phaser.<br> But what if the creatures attack again? They won't attack for several hours.<br> By then, with luck, we'll be gone.<br> If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands.<br> Not that we can maintain it long.<br> We don't have to maintain it very long.<br> In less than 24 hours, the Enterprise will be forced to abandon its search in order to make a rendezvous.<br> If we can't maintain orbit after that time, it won't make any difference.<br> If we burn up in a decaying orbit or die here on the planet's surface, we shall surely die.<br> Doctor, your phaser.<br> Go to work, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> They came back all right, sir.<br> In my opinion, the transporters are now safe for human transport.<br> Good.<br> This is the captain.<br> Landing parties 1 , 2, and 3, report to transporter room for immediate beaming-down to the surface of the planet, ordinance condition 1 -A.<br> Captain, it's a big planet.<br> It'll be sheer luck to find anything.<br> I'm depending on luck.<br> It's almost our only working tool.<br> [Growling] Aahh [Rrraarr] Aah! Take this back to Mr.<br> Scott for conversion, please, Doctor.<br> Nobody knows what's happened to Gaetano, and you hand over his phaser Iike nothing's happened at all.<br> And give this to Mr.<br> Scott in the event I don't return.<br> Just where are you going? I have a certain scientific curiosity about what's become of Mr.<br> Gaetano.<br> Return to the ship, please.<br> I don't know.<br> He'll risk his neck locating Gaetano.<br> Then if he finds him, he's just as liable to order him to stay behind.<br> You tell me.<br> Do you really think the ship will ever leave? Well, it won't unless we get these phasers back.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock, they didn't stay frightened very long, did they? Most illogical reaction.<br> We demonstrated our superior weapons.<br> They should have fled.<br> You mean they should have respected us? Of course.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, respect is a rational process.<br> Did it ever occur to you they might react emotionally, with anger? Doctor, I am not responsible for their unpredictability.<br> They were perfectly predictable to anyone with feeling.<br> You might as well admit it, Mr.<br> Spock, your precious logic brought them down on us.<br> Why haven't they done anything? They're studying us, for the moment.<br> Another prediction, Mr.<br> Spock? My opinion, Mr.<br> Boma.<br> [Crash] Seal the windows! Studying us, Mr.<br> Spock? They seem to learn rather quickly.<br> Spock, you have all the answers.<br> What now? Your tone is increasingly hostile.<br> My tone isn't the only thing that's hostile, Mr.<br> Spock! Curious.<br> Most illogical.<br> I'm sick and tired of your logic! We could use a little inspiration.<br> Strange.<br> Step by step, I've made the correct and logical decisions.<br> And yet, two men have died.<br> And you've brought our furry friends down on us.<br> I do seem to have miscalculated regarding them and inculcated resentment on your parts.<br> The sum of the parts cannot be greater than the whole.<br> Less analysis and more action-- That's what we need, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> How much longer, Mr.<br> Scott? Another hour, maybe two.<br> It won't be long enough.<br> Doctor, a phaser can only drain so fast! How long do you think those plates will hold out? We've got to do something! Well, you've got your hands full.<br> Captain's Log.<br>: Stardate 2823.<br> 1.<br> Our landing parties are on the surface of Taurus 2.<br> We continue to hope.<br> Instruments are slowly returning to an operable condition as the ion storm slowly disperses.<br> On the ship, we can only wait helplessly.<br> What word from the sensor section? At last report-- I want to know now! Yes, sir.<br> You have 2 hours and 43 minutes, Captain.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> But I shall continue to remind you.<br> You do that.<br> Sir, sensor section reporting.<br> Static interference still creating false images.<br> Estimates What about radio communication? Clearing slowly.<br> Still incapable of transmission or reception.<br> What do you intend to do? Do? I intend to continue the search, inch by inch, by candlelight, if necessary, until the last possible moment.<br> If you'd keep your nose off my bridge, I'd be thankful.<br> I'm sure the authorities will be pleased by your diligence.<br> I'm not sure they'll appreciate the way you address a high commissioner.<br> I'm in command here, Mr.<br> Ferris.<br> You are, Captain.<br> For another 2 hours and 42 minutes.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, how much power do we have left in the ship's batteries? They're in good shape, but they won't launch us.<br> Will they electrify the ship's exterior? That they will, Mr.<br> Spock! Get to the ship's center.<br> Don't touch the plates.<br> Be sure you're insulated.<br> Stand by.<br> Are you ready, Scott? Ready, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> All right.<br> Go! Again! Again! I daren't use any more and be sure of ignition.<br> We've used enough.<br> Drain the phasers.<br> Aye, aye.<br> It must've worked.<br> For the moment.<br> For the moment? When they discover they're not seriously hurt, they'll be back.<br> Meanwhile, please check the aft compartments.<br> See if there's anything you can unload to lighten the ship.<br> Mr.<br> Gaetano's body is back there.<br> It will be left behind.<br> Not without a burial.<br> I wouldn't recommend it.<br> The creatures won't be far away.<br> Not without a burial.<br> It would expose the crew to unnecessary peril.<br> I'll take that chance.<br> You see, Mr.<br> Spock, I would insist upon a burial even if you were back there.<br> Mr.<br> Boma.<br> I'm sick and tired of this machine! That's enough! Gentlemen.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Boma, you'll have your burial, provided the creatures will permit it.<br> Captain Kirk, landing party number 2 has been beamed back aboard ship.<br> They have casualties-- one dead, two injured.<br> Put Lieutenant Kelowitz on visual.<br> Kelowitz, Captain.<br> Report.<br> We were attacked, Captain.<br> Huge, furr creatures.<br> I checked with astral anthropology, and they're order similarto life forms discoveredon Hansen's Planet, but much larger.<br> Your casualties? Ensign O'Nealgot a spear through the body before we even knew they were around.<br> Lieutenant lmmamura has a dislocated shoulder and severe lacerations, but he'll make it.<br> Captain, the creatures are all over the place.<br> If the Galileo is down on that planet, I-- Thank you, Lieutenant.<br> You better report to sick bay yourself.<br> Aye, aye, Captain.<br> Captain Kirk check your chronometer.<br> You'll see that it is Your time is up.<br> But they're still out there.<br> So are the plague victims on New Paris.<br> I'm sorry, Captain.<br> I now assume authority granted me under title 15, galactic emergency procedures, and I order you to abandon search.<br> The Columbus hasn't returned yet.<br> I have two search parties out.<br> You're procrastinating, Captain.<br> You have your orders.<br> Recall your search parties and proceed to Makus 3 immediately.<br> [Radio Static] Lieutenant order the transporter room to immediately beam up the two search parties from the surface.<br> Attempt to contact the Columbus.<br> I'm in partial contact now, sir.<br> Have them return immediately.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, prepare to abandon search.<br> Set course for Makus 3.<br> Captain's Log, supplement.<br> The search parties have returned to the ship, and the Columbus is on its way back.<br> I have been compelled to abandon the search.<br> Captain, the sensor section says the beams are working again.<br> What about the other systems? No, sir.<br> Too much interference.<br> Course set for Makus 3.<br> Stand ready, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> How long before the Columbus comes on board? Enterprise, this is Galileo.<br> Come in, please.<br> Enterprise! Nothing, sir.<br> Just ionic interference.<br> That's it.<br> How about weight? If we shed every ounce, we might achieve orbit.<br> How long can we hold it? A few hours, no longer.<br> But if we time it right, we can cut out of orbit and save enough fuel for a controlled reentry.<br> To land here again.<br> Not an attractive possibility.<br> We have very few alternatives.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy! Mr.<br> Boma! When can we lift off, Scott? Maybe eight minutes if the weight's right.<br> Gentlemen, The ship will lift off in exactly 10 minutes.<br> You have that long to bury Mr.<br> Gaetano.<br> It appears to be clear outside for the moment.<br> I'll assist you.<br> Hurry.<br> The Columbus is aboard, sir.<br> The flight hatch is closed.<br> Transporter room reports Iast of the landing parties have beamed safely up.<br> All systems report secured for warp factors.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, proceed on course for Makus 3 at space normal speed.<br> Space normal, sir? Those are my orders.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, order all sensor sections to direct beams aft.<br> Full function, continuous operation until further orders.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Get to the ship! Immediate lift off! Aah! No! Go back! Lift off! Go back! No! All right, All right! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go, Scott! Aye, aye, sir.<br> I told you to lift off! Don't be a fool! We couldn't leave you out there! Get us off, Scott! We should be moving, but we're not.<br> Quite right, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> They seem to be holding us down.<br> All systems are go, but we're not moving.<br> What are you doing? Our boosters.<br> We won't hold orbit.<br> Would you rather stay here? No, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're moving! Let it go! We're off! We have yet to achieve orbit, nor can we maintain it long.<br> An hour from now we may be right back where we started from.<br> By coming after me, you may well have destroyed your slim chance for survival.<br> The logical thing foryou to have done was to have left me behind.<br> Remind me to tell you that I'm sick and tired of your logic.<br> That is a most illogical attitude.<br> Orbit in one minute, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Fuel status? Approximately enough for one orbit, sir.<br> After that? Tapping our boosters ended our last chance for a soft landing.<br> You mean a burn-up? The usual end of a decaying orbit.<br> I don't want to die up here.<br> Infinitely preferable to the kind of death we'd have on the planet's surface.<br> I admire your ability to make so measured a choice.<br> You said a while ago that there were always alternatives.<br> Did l? I may have been mistaken.<br> Well, at least I lived long enough to hear that.<br> Is there anything we can do? The Enterprise is surely on course for Makus 3 by now.<br> I, for one, do not believe in angels.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock, so ends your first command.<br> Yes.<br> My first command.<br> Orbit attitude, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> With our present fuel, that gives us about 45 minutes.<br> Galileo to Enterprise.<br> Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.<br> Galileo to Enterprise, come in, please.<br> Mr.<br> Spock! [Jet Surge] What happened? Hejettisoned the fuel and ignited it.<br> We need that fuel to maintain orbit.<br> Are you crazy? Perhaps, Mr.<br> Boma.<br> How long do we have? The orbit will start decaying as soon as the fuel's exhausted.<br> Say six minutes.<br> [Voices On Radio Transmission] Forward scanner to bridge, status report.<br> Section on alert-- Captain, there's something there on the screen, at Taurus 2.<br> Sensors a meteorite?

Quite simply, Captain.<br> I examined the problem from all angles, and it was plainly hopeless.<br> Logic informed me that, under the circumstances, the only possible action would have to be one of desperation.<br> Logical decision, logically arrived at.<br> Aha, ha ha.<br> I see.<br> You mean you reasoned that it was time for an emotional outburst.<br> Well, I wouldn't put it in exactly those terms, Captain, but those are essentially the facts.<br> You're not going to admit that for the first time in your life, you committed a purely human, emotional act?

Nonsense.<br> You're my guests.<br> You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society.<br> You came by at the most propitious moment.<br> I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest.<br> Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest.<br> When we do battle, it's because we have no choice.<br> That's the official story, eh?

I don't, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> It simply exists.<br> Artificial or a freak of nature.<br> The fact remains that life can exist in that area.<br> Aye, it could, but it couldn't move around much.<br> Apply a fine tuning on our sensors.<br> Locate any life-forms in that stable area.<br> If we find any, it may not be our people.<br> Affirmative.<br> But if the captain is down there and alive, that's where he'll have to be.<br> We'll attempt to transport up any living beings our sensors detect.<br> Shooting in the dark? Or stand by and do nothing, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> And this, of course, is an array of your battle flags and pennants dating back to the Crusades, to Hannibal's invaders, the Grecian war galleys, and the hordes of Persia.<br> Can't you imagine it, Captain? The thousands of men marching off to their deaths, singing beneath these banners.<br> Doesn't it make your blood run swiftly? Captain where could he possibly come from? Who is this maniac? Better say, what is he? I monitored him, and what I found was unbelievable.<br> Not alive? Not in the way we define life.<br> No trace.<br> Zero.<br> You mean it shows he's dead? It doesn't even show that he exists at all, alive or dead.<br> Notice the wood fire, Captain? Burning steadily, ember bed glowing, and it doesn't give off any heat at all.<br> Fire without heat, mistaking all this for present-day Earth without taking into account the time differential.<br> Whatever we're dealing with, he certainly isn't all-knowledgeable.<br> He makes mistakes.<br> Discussing deep-laid plans, I'll wager.<br> [ Laughs ] I cannot wait to see them evolve.<br> Trelane we haven't planned-- Tut-tut.<br> Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem.<br> Quite the contrary.<br> I have nothing but admiration for your whole species.<br> If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty.<br> Our ship needs us.<br> We have tasks to perform.<br> Oh, I can't let you go now.<br> I was getting a bit bored until you came.<br> You must stay.<br> I insist.<br> For how long? Until this is over.<br> Until what is over? Dear Captain, so many questions.<br> Make the most ofan uncertain future.<br> Enjoy yourself today.<br> Tomorrow may never come at all.<br> Even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us.<br> Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at the separation.<br> There are 400 men and women aboard that ship.<br> Women? Do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew? Oh, how charming.<br> Ha ha.<br> And they must be all very beautiful.<br> And I shall be so very gallant to them.<br> Here, let me fetch them down at once.<br> No.<br> No?

What was it? What was down there? Well, it was a-- Oh, forget it.<br> Look.<br> Where are all your weapons, Captain? Don't you display your weapons? Trelane.<br> Don't fret, Captain.<br> I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mr.<br> Spockyou mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he? I'm Spock.<br> Oh, surely not an officer.<br> Isn't quite human, is he? My father is from the planet Vulcan.<br> And are its natives predatory? Not generally.<br> But there have been exceptions.<br> Oh, really? You will see to his punishment? On the contrary.<br> I commend his action.<br> But I don't like him.<br> Get off my ship.<br> Oh, rot! You're all going back with me.<br> We're not going anywhere.<br> Nonsense.<br> I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for you all.<br> You shan't spoil it for me.<br> Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate and tasteful.<br> Don't you agree?

Fair Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.<br> Yeoman Teresa Ross.<br> I believe you have met our science officer Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You do realize, don't you, that it's in deference to the captain that I brought you here? Affirmative.<br> Well, I don't know if I like your tone.<br> It's most challenging.<br> That's what you're doing, challenging me? I object to you.<br> I object to intellect without discipline.<br> I object to power without constructive purpose.<br> Oh, Mr.<br> Spock, you do have one saving grace after all.<br> You're ill-mannered.<br> The human half of you, no doubt.<br> Ah, come, my little wood nymph.<br> Won't you dance with your swain? Give us some sprightly music, my dear girl.<br> Oh, I don't know how to play this.<br> Of course you do.<br> Captain, how far do we go along with this charade? Until we can think our way out.<br> Meanwhile, we accept his hospitality.<br> You should taste his food.<br> Straw would taste better than his meat, water a hundred times better than his brandy.<br> Nothing has any taste at all.<br> It may be unappetizing, Doctor, but it is very logical.<br> There's that magic word again.<br> Does your logic find this fascinating, Mr.<br> Spock? No.<br> \"Fascinating\" is a word I use for the unexpected.<br> In this case, I should think \"interesting\" would suffice.<br> You don't find this unexpected, Mr.<br> Spock? That his food has no taste, his wine no flavor? No.<br> It simply means that Trelane knows all ofthe Earth forms, but none ofthe substance.<br> And if he's fallible, he can't be all-powerful, which means he has something helping him.<br> Evidently.<br> A machine? A device? Something which does these things for him.<br> Ah, my dear, don't we make a graceful pair? Except for one small detail-- that dress hardly matches this charming scene.<br> Ah, yes, that's more what we want-- the dashing warrior and his elegant lady.<br> That mirror it's part of his audience, his ego.<br> He never wanders from it.<br> Is it ego or something else? Explain.<br> The mirror.<br> What? You noted he never gets far from it.<br> I suppose it could be vanity.<br> No, no, Mr.<br> Spock, that's not the reason.<br> What kind ofa machine could do these things? A machine with the ability to turn energy into matter guided by thought waves.<br> It would have a very complex memory bank.<br> It would be extremely sophisticated.<br> Like a computer, only much more.<br> Could the machine that maintains the environment in this immediate area be kept in this house? I think not.<br> A device capable of keeping out this planet's natural atmosphere would be immense.<br> Good.<br> I agree.<br> That leaves me free.<br> Free, Captain? If I'm not mistaken, Mr.<br> Spock, I think I can turn his lights off at the source.<br> Don't be too upset by what you see, gentlemen.<br> After all, his actions are those ofan immature, unbalanced mind.<br> I overheard that remark, Captain.<br> I'm afraid I'll have to dispense with you.<br> You only heard part of it.<br> I just started.<br> Oh? Yes.<br> I want you to leave my crew alone.<br> Don't dance with him.<br> Did it make you angry? Don't accept his gifts, either.<br> I believe the dear captain's Jealous of me.<br> I don't care what you believe.<br> Keep your hands off her! How curiously human, how wonderfully barbaric.<br> I've had enough of your attentions to her.<br> Of course.<br> That's the root of the matter, isn't it?

Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.<br>3.<br> First Officer Spock reporting.<br> Still no word from Captain Kirk on the surface below us.<br> Waiting time is almost up.<br> I willsoon be forced to attempt departure as per instructions.<br> Until a moment ago, I didn't think it possible, but it was.<br> I did it.<br> I was angry.<br> I actually experienced genuine rage.<br> This experiment has been successful.<br> I'm glad you weren't disappointed.<br> Why, Captain, you're still angry.<br> Would that I could have sustained that moment.<br> Ah, no matter.<br> Do you have a last request? If you think I'm going to obediently stick my head in that noose-- You still haven't learned.<br> You have no choice.<br> Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome.<br> It's all so very easy.<br> That's your problem, Trelane-- everything's easy.<br> It's given you a bad habit.<br> You're not aware of it, but you have it.<br> You don't think, Trelane.<br> That's your problem.<br> You miss opportunities, Iike your anger before and mine right now.<br> Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why? Because you're a bumbling, inept fool.<br> Take care, now.<br> Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it.<br> You want to commit murder? Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging? The sport? Yes the terror of murder, the suspense, the fun.<br> Oh, I'm intrigued.<br> Go ahead, Captain.<br> What do you suggest? A personal conflict between us-- not like the duel before, but the real thing.<br> The stakes? A human life--mine.<br> Oh yes! Yes! That's the idea.<br> Oh, then you approve? Yes, but you can do better than that.<br> There's still not enough sport in killing me with a sword.<br> I know.<br> That will be dull.<br> We'll have to have something more fanciful.<br> Let me see a hunt, a royal hunt-- predator against predator.<br> Now, you may go hide in the forest-- anywhere you like-- and I shall seek.<br> How does that strike you, Captain? It strikes me very well but you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane.<br> Why not up the stakes? The stakes? Yes.<br> While we're playing our game, free my ship.<br> Let it continue on its way.<br> In return, I'll give you a contest you'll remember.<br> Always back to your ship.<br> Oh, well if it will add spice to the pursuit I accept your terms, Captain.<br> [ Trelane ] Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly.<br> Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.<br> At your convenience.<br> Enterprise Enterprise, this is Kirk.<br> Can you hear me? [ Static ] Get the ship away as fast as you can.<br> I'll try and give you the time you need.<br> Can you hear me? Aha! Enterprise Ha ha! Captain Kirk.<br> You must try harder, Captain.<br> This is too easy.<br> Enterprise Enterprise, can you hear me? Touche, Captain.<br> Touche.<br> I must confess you scored first, but after all, I never played this game before.<br> And now let's have at it again! Ha ha ha! Enterprise Enterprise Aha! Tallyho! Aha You made a noble fight of it, Captain.<br> Remember, you promised to let my ship go.<br> But this is such sport.<br> I must fetch all the others back to play.<br> So this is victory.<br> It has a sweet taste.<br> Down, Captain-- on your knees! You haven't won, Trelane.<br> I could run you through! But you haven't won anything.<br> On your knees, Captain! No! Does it still taste as sweet? I order you.<br> You've been beaten! But I'm not defeated.<br> I order you! I order you! You broke it! You broke my sword! You've got a lot to learn about winning, Trelane.<br> You dare to defy me! You've got a lot to learn about everything.<br> I'll fix you! You cheated! You haven't played the game right.<br> I'll show you! [ Woman's Voice ] Trelane! No! No! You said I could have this planet.<br> [ Man's Voice ] This has gone far enough.<br> But you always stop me when I'm having fun.<br> You're disobedient and cruel.<br> We've told you before.<br> Time to come in now, Trelane.<br> I don't want to come in, and I won't.<br> I'm a general, and I won't listen to you.<br> Enough, Trelane.<br> Come along.<br> But why? I didn't do anything wrong.<br> I was just playing.<br> We said come along.<br> But I haven't finished studying my predators yet.<br> This is not studying them.<br> If you cannot take proper care of your pets, you cannot have them.<br> Aw, but I was winning.<br> I was winning.<br> They're beings, Trelane.<br> They have spirit.<br> They're superior.<br> No, no.<br> You saw.<br> You'll grow up, Trelane.<br> You'll understand.<br> Now come along.<br> Aw, but you said I could.<br> You promised.<br> I never have any fun.<br> Stop that nonsense at once, or you'll not be permitted to make any more planets.<br> Aw, but you saw.<br> I was winning.<br> I would have won honest.<br> No, Trelane.<br> No, Trelane.<br> I would have.<br> I would have.<br> I would have.<br> I would.<br> I would.<br> I would.<br> I would.<br> Captain, we regret that the life paths of yourself and your companions have been disturbed.<br> Who are you? Who is Trelane? You must forgive our child.<br> The fault is ours for indulging him too much.<br> He will be punished.<br> We would not have let him intercept you had we realized your vulnerability.<br> Forgive us, Captain.<br> We will maintain your life-support conditions while you return to your ship.<br> Please accept our apologies.<br> Captain to Enterprise.<br> Captain to Enterprise.<br> [ Spock ] Captain, we're receiving you.<br> Beam me up, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're free to go.<br> Warping down, Captain.<br> Our warp factor--4.<br> Approach channels clear, Captain.<br> Colony Beta 6 clears us for normal approach, sir.<br> Normal orbit approach procedures, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Captain.<br> Still thinking about Trelane, is that it? For the record, how do we describe him-- pure mentality, force of intellect, embodied energy, superbeing? He must be classified, sir.<br> God of war, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Well, I hardly find that fitting.<br> Then a small boy, and a very naughty one.<br> It will make a strange entry in the library banks.<br> He was a very strange small boy.<br> He was probably doing things comparable to the mischievous pranks you played when you were a boy.<br> Mischievous pranks, Captain? Yes-- dipping little girls' curls in inkwells, stealing apples from the neighbors' trees, tying cans on-- Forgive me Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I should have known better.<br> I shall be delighted, Captain.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Why? Why did they do it? There has to be a reason.<br> There has to be a reason! It was a trap-- Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus III, getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.<br> Very clever.<br> As to the reason-- The reason is crystal clear.<br> The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.<br> Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open.<br> You allude to invasion, Captain, yet positive proof-- I have all the proof I need on Cestus III.<br> Not necessarily.<br> Several possible explanations-- How can you explain a massacre like that? No, Mr.<br> Spock, the threat is clear and immediate.<br> Invasion.<br> Very well, then.<br> If that's the case, you must make certain that the alien vessel never reaches its home base.<br> I intend to.<br> If we can keep them in the dark as to our strength, they'll never dare move against us.<br> - Captain to helms man.<br> - Sulu here, sir.<br> - Is the alien still making warp 5? - Affirmative, sir.<br> - Initiate warp 6.<br> - Affirmative, sir.<br> Overtake.<br> Phaser banks Iock on to the enemy vessel.<br> Stand by for firing orders.<br> [Siren] All hands, this is the captain.<br> We are going into battle.<br> All hands, battle stations.<br> Red alert.<br> I repeat, red alert.<br> This is no drill.<br> This is no drill.<br> Captain's log, Stardate 3046.<br>2.<br> We are in hot pursuit of the alien vessel which destroyed the Earth outpost on Cestus III.<br> - Mr.<br> Depaul.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Position.<br> latest chart limits, sir.<br> All scanners lock into computer banks.<br> I want a complete record of this.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, what do we have on this general area?

A sustained warp 7 speed will be dangerous, Captain.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> -I mean to catch them.<br> -We'll either catch them or blow up.<br> They may be faster than we are.<br> They'll have to prove it.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock? -You mean to destroy the alien ship.<br> -Of course.<br> I thought perhaps the hot pursuit alone might be sufficient.<br> Destruction may be unnecessary.<br> Colony Cestus III has been obliterated, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The destruction of the alien vessel will not help that colony,Jim.<br> If the aliens go unpunished, they'll be back, attacking other Federation installations.<br> I merely suggested that a regard for sentient-- There's no time for that.<br> It's a matter of policy.<br> Out here, we're the only policemen around.<br> And a crime has been committed.<br> Do I make myself clear?

No, sir.<br> He's headed away from it.<br> Captain, sensors report we're being scanned.<br> By the alien ship? No, sir.<br> It's from that solar system ahead.<br> Any interference, resistance? No, sir, Just scanning beams.<br> It's on an unusual wave length.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? It would appear someone is curious about us.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Is the alien still heading away from that solar system? Yes, sir.<br> We're closing, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, anything further on those scanning beams? There's no hostility, sir.<br> They're not tractors or weapons ofany sort, Just increasing in intensity.<br> Steady.<br> Regular.<br> It's growing stronger, sir.<br> Captain! Yes, what is it? The alien it's slowing down.<br> Warp 542.<br> It's going sublight, sir.<br> Sir? It's stopped dead in space.<br> He may be turning to fight.<br> No, sir.<br> They're just dead out there.<br> Are you sure? Yes, sir.<br> Unmoving.<br> Then we've got him!

I don't know, sir, but whatever it is, we cannot move.<br> We're being held in place, Captain, apparently from that solar system.<br> This far out? That's impossible.<br> We are being held.<br> Tractor beam? No, sir, an unidentifiable power.<br> [Male Voice] We are the Metrons.<br> You are one of two crafts which have come into our space on a mission of violence.<br> This is not permissible.<br> Yet we have analyzed you and have learned that your violent tendencies are inherent.<br> So be it.<br> We will control them.<br> We will resolve your conflict in the way most suited to your limited mentalities.<br> Captain James Kirk.<br> This is Kirk.<br> We have prepared a planet with a suitable atmosphere.<br> You will be taken there as will the Captain of the Gorn ship which you have been pursuing.<br> There you will settle your dispute.<br> I don't understand.<br> You will be provided with a recording-translating device, in hopes that a chronicle ofthis contest will serve to dissuade others of your kind from entering our system-- but you will not be permitted to communicate with your ship.<br> You will each be totally alone.<br> What makes you think you can interfere-- It is you who are interfering.<br> We are simply putting a stop to it.<br> The place we have prepared foryou contains sufficient elements for either ofyou to construct weapons lethal enough to destroy the other, which seems to be your intention.<br> The winner ofthe contest will be permitted to go his way unharmed.<br> The loser, along with his ship, shall be destroyed in the interests of peace.<br> The contest will be one of ingenuity against ingenuity, brute strength against brute strength.<br> The results will be final.<br> -Just a min-- - There will be no discussion.<br> It is done.<br> Aah! He's gone.<br> [Roaring, Hissing] The Enterprise is dead in space, stopped cold during her pursuit of an alien raider by mysterious forces, and I have been somehow whisked off the bridge and placed on the surface of an asteroid, facing the captain of the alien ship.<br> Weaponless, I face the creature the Metrons calleda Gorn-- Large, reptilian.<br> Like most humans, I seem to have an instinctive revulsion to reptiles.<br> I must fight to remember that this is an intelligent, highly advanced individual-- the captain ofa starship, like myself, undoubtedly a dangerously clever opponent.<br> [Hissing] [Growling] [Hissing] [Growling] [Growling] [Hissing] You tried overload? Aye, sir.<br> It does no good.<br> How about bypassing the transformer banks-- feed the impulse engines directly? I tried that, sir-- Nothing.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, have sensors learned anything about the nature ofthe force which holds us here? No, sir.<br> They report they emanate from that solar system ahead.<br> No indication of its composition-- gravimetric, magnetic, electronic? Nothing, sir.<br> This is Captain James Kirk of the Starship Enterprise.<br> Who ever finds this please get it to Star fleet Command.<br> I'm engaged in personal combat with a creature apparently called a Gorn.<br> He's immensely strong.<br> Already he has with stood attacks from me that would have killed a human being.<br> Fortunately, though strong, he is not agile.<br> The agility, and I hope the cleverness, is mine.<br> The Metrons, the creatures that sent us both here, said that the surface of the planet provides the raw material to construct weapons.<br> There's very little here-- scrub brush, rocks, an abundance of mineral deposits-- but no weapons in the conventional sense.<br> Still, I need to find one.<br> Bare-handed against the Gorn I have no chance.<br> Leave channel one open, Lieutenant, just in case.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> What are you going to do, Mr.<br> Spock? I'm going to wait, Doctor.<br> There is little else I can do.<br> What about the captain? If I could help him, I would.<br> I cannot.<br> Now, you're the one that's always talking about logic.<br> What about some logic now? Where's the captain, Mr.<br> Spock? He's out there, Doctor-- out there somewhere in 1,000 cubic parsecs ofspace, and there's absolutely nothing we can do to help him.<br> [Growling, Chuckling] A large deposit of diamonds on the surface-- perhaps the hardest substance known in the universe, beautifully crystallized and pointed, but too small to be useful as a weapon.<br> An incredible fortune in stones yet I would trade them all for a hand phaser, or a good solid club.<br> Yet the Metrons said there would be weapons if I could find them.<br> Where? - [Gorn Growling] - What kind? [Growling, Hissing] [Growling] [Gorn Growling] [Hissing] [Growling] [Hissing] This is the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise calling the Metrons.<br> Our channels are open.<br> Come in, please.<br> We urgently desire a conference.<br> Please answer.<br> This may be my last entry.<br> I am almost exhausted.<br> Unless I find the weapon the Metron mentioned I have very little time left.<br> Native sulfur, diamonds.<br> This place is a mineralogist's dream.<br> Yet there is something about sulfur.<br> Something very old.<br> Something-- [Growling] If only I could remember.<br> The ship, our engines, our weapons it'sjust inconceivable that we are immobilized.<br> But it has happened, Doctor.<br> We are the Metrons.<br> Your captain is losing his battle.<br> We would suggest you make whatever memorial arrangements, if any, which are customary in your culture.<br> We believe you have very little time left.<br> We appeal to you in the name of civilization.<br> Put a stop to this.<br> Your violent intent and actions demonstrate that you are not civilized.<br> However, we are not without compassion.<br> It is possible you may have feelings toward your captain.<br> So that you will be able to prepare yourself, we will allow you to see and hear what is now transpiring.<br> [Hissing] If there were only some way we could contact him.<br> Yes, indeed, Doctor, if only there were.<br> Notice the substance encrusting that rock.<br> Yes.<br> Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate.<br> So? Perhaps nothing, Doctor.<br> Perhaps everything.<br> Earthling! Captain! Who is this, the Metron? This is your opponent, Earthling.<br> I have heard every word you have said.<br> All right.<br> What do you want? I'm weary of the chase.<br> Wait for me.<br> I shall be merciful and quick.<br> Like you were at Cestus III? You were intruding! You established an outpost in our space.<br> You butchered helpless human beings-- We destroyed invaders, as I shall destroy you! Can that be true? Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space? It may well be possible, Doctor.<br> We know very little about that section of the galaxy.<br> Then we could be in the wrong.<br> Perhaps.<br> That is something best decided by diplomats.<br> The Gorn simply might have been trying to protect themselves.<br> Yes.<br> [Gorn Snarls] [Hissing] Fascinating.<br> Good.<br> Good.<br> He knows, Doctor.<br> He has reasoned it out.<br> [Gorn Snarls] Yes.<br> Yes.<br> What is it, Spock? An invention, Doctor.<br> First potassium nitrate, and now if he can find some sulfur and a charcoal deposit or ordinary coal What's he doing? Diamonds-- the hardest known substance.<br> Impelled by sufficient force, they would make formidable projectiles.<br> What force? Recall your basic chemistry, Doctor.<br> Gunpowder.<br> Captain, let us be reasonable.<br> You have lost! Admit it to yourself! Stop running! Coal.<br> [Hissing] Can he do it? If he has the time, Doctor.<br> If he has the time.<br> [Hissing] [Growling] No.<br> No, I won't kill you.<br> Maybe you thought you were protecting yourself when you attacked the outpost.<br> No, I won't kill him! Do you hear? You'll have to get your entertainment someplace else! You're a Metron? Does my appearance surprise you, Captain? You seem more like a boy.<br> I am approximately You surprise me, Captain.<br> How? By sparing your helpless enemy-- who surely would have destroyed you-- you demonstrated the advanced trait of mercy, something we hardly expected.<br> We feel there may be hope for your kind.<br> Therefore you will not be destroyed.<br> It would not be civilized.<br> What happened to the Gorn? I sent him back to his ship.<br> If you like, I shall destroy him for you.<br> No.<br> That won't be necessary.<br> We can talk maybe reach an agreement.<br> Very good, Captain.<br> There is hope for you.<br> Perhaps in several thousand years, your people and mine shall meet to reach an agreement.<br> You are still halfsavage, but there is hope.<br> We will contact you when we are ready.<br> [Uhura] Captain!

Captain Christopher.<br> What about him? We cannot return him to Earth, Captain.<br> He already knows too much about us and is learning more.<br> I do not specifically refer to Captain Christopher, but suppose an unscrupulous man were to gain certain knowledge of man's future? Such a man could manipulate key industries, stocks, and even nations.<br> And, in so doing, change what must be.<br> And if it is changed, Captain, you and I, and all that we know, might not even exist.<br> Your logic can be most annoying.<br> That flight suit must be uncomfortable.<br> Why don't you have the quartermaster issue him something more suitable? Then I want to meet you and him in my quarters.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Computer on.<br> Record.<br> [Computer] Recording.<br> [Doorbell Buzzes] Come.<br> Captain's log-- supplemental.<br> Engineering Officer Scott informs warp engines damaged, but can be made operational and re-energized.<br> [Computer] Computed and recorded, dear.<br> Computer, you will not address me in that manner.<br> Compute.<br> Computed, dear.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I ordered this computer and its interlinking systems repaired.<br> I have investigated it, Captain.<br> To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the entire computer system and a minimum of three weeks at a starbase.<br> I wouldn't mind so much if it didn't get so affectionate.<br> It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.<br> I take it a lady computer is not routine.<br> We'd put in at Signet 14 for general repairs.<br> Signet 14 is a planet dominated by women.<br> They felt the ship's computer system lacked a personality.<br> They gave it one.<br> Female, of course.<br> Ha ha! Well, you people certainly have interesting problems.<br> I'd love to stay around to see how your girlfriend works out, but-- I'm afraid you'll have to.<br> We can't send you back.<br> Can't? Spock said that your transporter can beam down an object, even from an orbit this high.<br> It's not the transporter.<br> It's you.<br> You know what the future looks like.<br> If anybody else finds out, they could change its course, destroy it.<br> Then my disappearance would change something, too.<br> I have run a check on all historical tapes.<br> They show no record of any relevant contribution by John Christopher.<br> Look, Captain, I don't buy all your time-accident story.<br> The experts can figure out who you are, what you are.<br> It's my duty to report what I've seen.<br> What would you do?

Security, this is the captain.<br> Security Chief here, sir.<br> All decks alert.<br> Captain Christopher is not in his assigned quarters.<br> He may be trying to escape.<br> Put a man outside the transporter room immediately.<br> I'm heading there myself.<br> All right! Nice and easy.<br> Now I'm going to step into that thing, and you're going to transport me back to Earth.<br> Well, Jim, with the exception of a slight bruise or two, our captain is as healthy as a proverbial horse.<br> He'll be coming to in a minute.<br> He tried to escape.<br> I know how he feels, but I can't send him back with what he knows.<br> Jim, what if we can't go back? What do we do? Wait up here for our supplies to run out, our power to die? It has to eventually, and we certainly can't go back to Earth.<br> It would be worse than the Captain being returned.<br> There are 430 of us.<br> Now, that means 430 chances of altering the future.<br> Yes We're not in that position yet.<br> I'm glad to hear it.<br> And if we do get back to where we belong, then he won't belong.<br> We're roughly about the same age.<br> But in our society, he'd be useless.<br> Archaic.<br> Maybe he could be retrained, re-educated.<br> Now you're sounding like Spock.<br> If you're going to get nasty, I'm going to leave.<br> Could he be retrained to forget his family? His children? The answer to that is no.<br> Mmm.<br> You all right? Yeah.<br> I see physical training is required in your service, too.<br> Mmm.<br> Crude methods, but effective.<br> What does he mean by that? Just a joke, Captain.<br> You said you had some additional information, Mr.<br> Spock? I made an error in my computations.<br> Oh? This could be an historic occasion.<br> I find that we must return Captain Christopher to Earth after all.<br> Why? You said I made no relative contribution.<br> Poor choice of words on my part.<br> I neglected, in my initial run-through, to correlate the possible contributions by offspring.<br> I find, after running a cross-check on that factor, that your son Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher headed, or will head, the first successful Earth-Saturn probe, which is a rather significant-- Wait a minute.<br> I don't have a son.<br> You mean, yet.<br> The doctor is correct.<br> Unless we return Captain Christopher to Earth, There will be no Colonel Sean Jeffrey Christopher to go to Saturn.<br> Well, that's it, isn't it? We'll have to find some way of A boy.<br> I'm going to have a son.<br> Acknowledging that we must return Captain Christopher, there are several problems, prime of which is the explanation of his return.<br> We tracked his plane wreckage down after our tractor beam crushed it.<br> It crashed in an open section of southern Nebraska.<br> That means those search parties will be crawling all over that range.<br> Captain Christopher himself complicated the matter.<br> When I made visual contact, I turned on my wing cameras.<br> I got close enough to take some pretty clear pictures.<br> Air Defense Command will be processing that film fast.<br> And A.<br>D.<br>C.<br> Control was probably recording my radio transmissions.<br> If I remember my history, these things were being dismissed as weather balloons, sundogs, explainable things-- at least publicly.<br> Captain, our tractor beam caught and crushed an Air Force plane.<br> It'll be impossible to explain this as anything other than a genuine U.<br>F.<br>O.<br> Possibly alien definitely destructive.<br> What about our problem, Mr.<br> Spock? Any ideas on how to get us back to our own time? A theory a reverse application of what happened to us.<br> Logically, it could work.<br> Also, logically, there are a hundred variables, any one of which could put us in a worse position than we're in now.<br> We're going to have to go back and get those reports and photos.<br> If the captain feels duty bound to report what he saw, there won't be any evidence to support him.<br> That makes me look like a liar or a fool.<br> Perhaps.<br> Not at all.<br> You'll simply be one of the thousands who thought he saw a U.<br>F.<br>O.<br> Captain, I know that base.<br> I was stationed there a year ago.<br> I'd like to-- No, Captain.<br> Thank you.<br> But if anything should go wrong, you might get hurt.<br> We couldn't risk that.<br> Neither could you or your son.<br> Well, I'd like to help.<br> I could sketch a layout of the place for you, show you where the record section and the photo lab are.<br> Primitive computer.<br> I've seen them demonstrated in museums.<br> Me, too.<br> If this one's like those, it'll make the devil's noise if you start it.<br> I don't intend to start it.<br> How long have they been down there now? Well, shouldn't they be coming up? It is a fact, Doctor, that prowling by stealth is more time-consuming than a direct approach.<br> In our case-- Shouldn't you be working on your time warp calculations, Mr.<br> Spock? I am.<br> Hold it.<br> Get your hands up.<br> Nowone at a time-- Hand me those belts.<br> And the bag.<br> It's been too long.<br> Jim should have at least signaled by now.<br> You may be correct, Doctor.<br> Open communicator channel.<br> [Beep Beep] What was that? What was what? That noise.<br> I didn't hear anything.<br> [Beep Beep] That noise-- It's coming from one of these things.<br> [Beep Beep] [Whirring] The emergency signal.<br> Stay right where you are.<br> One emergency signal, sir.<br> Beam up immediately.<br> Only one signal.<br> What happened? We'll know in a moment, Doctor.<br> [Signal Sounds] Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> Are you all right, Captain? Yes, I'm all right, but as you can see, we haveanother problem.<br> Captain 's Log, Stardate 3113.<br>9.<br> First Officer Spock recording.<br> Due to an unfortunate accident, we have taken aboard another unwanted passenger.<br> Your surprise package is an air police sergeant from the base.<br> Keep him there.<br> No use in letting him see more of the ship than is necessary.<br> I don't believe there'll be trouble in that respect, Captain.<br> Our guest seems quite satisfied to remain where he is.<br> Kirk out.<br> What was the chronometer reading when we first sighted Christopher's jet? in that time zone-- maybe a little after.<br> Put it at the end of these tapes, will you? You've got them all.<br> [Door Opens] We'll try the darkroom.<br> Photo lab.<br> That's That's it.<br> That's all ofthem.<br> Signal Mr.<br> Spock that we're almost ready to beam up.<br> I'll make a check of the files just in case.<br> Yes, sir.<br> All right.<br> Where's the other one? What other one? Your partner.<br> I saw somebody move in there.<br> No, no, no.<br>Just me.<br> Besides, could anyone get out of here without your seeing them? No.<br> Nobody should have been able to.<br> Your decision to beam up was quite correct, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Engine room to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Spock here.<br> We've completedre-energizing the warp engines, sir.<br> We can refire them anytime.<br> Do so now, engineer.<br> We'll need all power to test our theory.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Engine room out.<br> Hmm.<br> Poor photography.<br> Blast your theories and observations, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> What about Jim? He's down there alone, probably under arrest.<br> He doesn't have a communicator, and we can't locate him or beam him back aboard without one.<br> I am aware of that, Doctor.<br> This is the first officer.<br> Captain Christopher to the briefing room.<br> Now, look, Mister.<br> You and I had better start communicating.<br> I want to know how you got in here.<br> That's a simple question.<br> Nobody saw you.<br> You got all the way inside without tripping any alarm.<br> How did you do it? Believe me, Colonel, you wouldn't believe me.<br> Don't try to be funny.<br> How did you get in? I popped in out of thin air.<br> You seem to think this is some kind of a game.<br> No, Colonel.<br> I know it's no game.<br> What did you say your name was? For the fourth time, my name is James T.<br> Kirk.<br> And how did you get inside a top security installation, James T.<br> Kirk? I told you you wouldn't believe me.<br> UhColonel, would you mind being careful with that? That worries you, huh? Is that a radio, transmitter of some kind? Of some kind.<br> You can be more specific than that, Kirk.<br> I don't like mysteries.<br> If you don't stop being careless with that, you'll have one-- a big one.<br> I'll have it disassembled and examined.<br> We are not dummies, mister.<br> We know how to fi nd out things we want to know.<br> What is that? Is that a uniform of some kind? This little thing? Something I slipped on.<br> Kirk, maybe you don't realize how serious this is.<br> Sabotage of a government installation-- Did I sabotage something? No.<br> We stopped you in time.<br> But what would you have done if we hadn't found you? Believe me, Colonel, nothing at all.<br> Is that what you're here for, nothing at all? That's what would have happened if you hadn't interfered.<br> All right, Kirk.<br> maybe this will make you laugh-- Sabotage, espionage, unauthorized entry, burglary! How are those for starters? I can think up lots more if you don't start talking.<br> All right, Colonel.<br> The truth is, I'm a little green man from Alpha Centauri, a beautiful place.<br> You ought to see it.<br> I am going to lock you up for 200 years.<br> That ought to be Just about right.<br> He's probably being held in security section.<br> Even if they've notified the authorities, it'll take time for someone to get there.<br> Can you give us the coordinates to beam down a landing party near those interrogation rooms? Yes.<br> But you're not going to get them unless you take me with you.<br> I can't do that, Captain.<br> If something went wrong-- Something's already gone wrong.<br> You could beam down anywhere inside that base, but it would take time to find him.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, you and Captain Christopher will beam down with me.<br> The captain will provide the coordinates for the transporter chief.<br> Shall I issue phasers? One for you, one for me, set on heavy stun force.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You don't trust me, Spock.<br> In fact, I do but only to a certain point.<br> Energize.<br> Do they do that all the time? Are you hungry? Uh-huh.<br> What would you like? Maybe some chicken soup.<br> It is.<br> Just a minute, sir.<br> Hold it.<br> [Knock On Door] See what that is, airman.<br> Don't you find that painful, Captain? Yes, I do.<br> What's he doing here? He knew the exact beam down coordinates.<br> It was necessary to bring him along.<br> I see.<br> No harm done.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, did you check out those tapes? Mr.<br> Spock ran them through.<br> We got them all.<br> They know you've been here.<br> They have a mystery and no answers.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, signal the transporter chief.<br> Four to beam up.<br> Uh-uh.<br> Not me.<br> Don't be a fool.<br> You know what's at stake.<br> You bet I do-- My family.<br> A son that isn't born yet.<br> You don't have to return me now, Captain.<br> Spock, come out of there.<br> You can't explain your presence here.<br> It's my duty to report everything.<br> That's explanation enough.<br> Spock! You'll go home, Christopher but you'll do it our way.<br> Over my dead body.<br> I suspected he might not wish to return with us.<br> Four to beam up, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain 's Log, Stardate 3114.<br>1.<br> We must make an attempt to break free of this time, or we and our reluctant passengers will remain its prisoners.<br> All we have is a theory anda few facts.<br> Mr.<br> Scott and I both agree that the only possible solution is the slingshot effect, Like the one that put us here.<br> My computations indicate that if we fly toward the sun, seek out its magnetic attraction, then pull away at full power, the whiplash will propel us into another time warp.<br> Slingshot effects are fine for you people.<br> How do you propose to return the Sergeant and me? Logically, as we move faster and faster toward the sun, we'll begin to move backward in time.<br> We'll actually go back beyond yesterday, beyond the point when we first appeared in the sky.<br> Then, breaking free will shoot us forward in time, and we'll transport you back before any of this happened.<br> You won't remember anything, because it never would have happened.<br> What if you can't pull free of the sun? We'll not be getting so close that my engines couldn't pull us out.<br> What I am worried about, sir-- We may not have much control when we're thrown forward again.<br> Helm control? Braking control, sir.<br> If I can't stop us soon enough, we may overshoot our time, and if I stop the engines suddenly, the strain may tear us apart.<br> Any way we do it, it's a mighty rough ride.<br> Well, gentlemen, we all have to take a chance-- especially if one is all you have.<br> Assume your stations.<br> Affirmative.<br> Engineering to bridge.<br> Environmentalcontrol, negative.<br> Engineering control, negative.<br> Ahead warp factor 3, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Warp factor 3, sir.<br> I never thought I'd make it into space.<br> I was in line to be chosen for the space program but I didn't qualify.<br> Take a good look around, Captain.<br> You made it here ahead of all of them.<br> Sir, our speed is increasing.<br> We're traveling at warp 8.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Since we've passed Mercury, the sun's pull on us has increased greatly.<br> From here, we'll move even faster.<br> And, Captain, notice the chronometers.<br> They've started backward.<br> Minute by minute, the speed o ftime passage will now increase.<br> Get your gear.<br> Report to the transporter room.<br> And Captain Christopher, you only have about 15 years, so you'd better hurry.<br> Approaching breakaway point.<br> On the countdown.<br> Now, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> More power, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Maximum now, sir.<br> She's fighting it.<br> Engineering, can you give a damage report?

Mr.<br> Spock, would you please-- Miss Finney, come with me, please.<br> Captain Kirk, you say you jettisoned the pod after the red alert? You have my sworn deposition.<br> Then, Captain, I must presume you've committed willful perjury.<br> This extract from your computer log says you jettisoned the pod before going to red alert.<br> Consider yourself confined to the base.<br> Official inquiry will determine whether a general court-martial is in order.<br> Space-- the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission-- to explores trange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.<br>5.<br> Starship Enterprise remains in orbit around Starbase 11.<br> Full repair is in progress.<br> I've been ordered to standbyon Starbase 11 until the inquirinto the death of Lieutenant Commander Finney can be conducted.<br> I'm confident of the outcome.<br> Timothy, I haven't seen you since the Vulcanian expedition.<br> Well, I see our graduating class from the academy is well represented.<br> Argan, Heller.<br> How you doing, Mike? I'll get by,Jim.<br> I understand you're laying over for repairs.<br> Big job? Couple of days.<br> You moving out then? - In a hurry to see me go? - I just wondered how long it'd take to get a new records officer.<br> You can talk plainer than that.<br> I can, but I think the point's been made.<br> Ben was a friend of ours.<br> Jim, let's-- Go on.<br> Finish.<br> Ben was a friend of yours, and-- Jim.<br> Go on.<br> I'm waiting to hear the rest.<br> Why don't you tell us? What would be the point? You've already made up your minds.<br> Excuse me, Bones.<br> If you have any doubt, that was indeed Captain James Kirk of the Enterprise.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Are you a friend of his? In these trying times, one of the few.<br> Dr.<br> Leonard McCoy.<br> And you? Areel Shaw.<br> And I'm a friend, too-- an old one.<br> All of my old friends look like doctors.<br> All of his look like you.<br> Well, you might as well join me for a drink.<br> With this inquiry coming up, he's going to need all the friends he can get.<br> [Click] Recording inquir.<br> Matter-- Captain Kirk, James T.<br> Subject-- circumstances of death, Lieutenant Commander Finney, Benjamin.<br> This inquiry to determine whether a general court-martial should be convened against Captain Kirk on charges of perjury and culpable negligence.<br> Ready.<br> Let us begin with your relationship with Commander Finney.<br> You knew him for a long time, didn't you? Yes.<br> He was an instructor at the academy when I was a midshipman.<br> But that didn't stand in the way of our beginning a close friendship.<br> His daughter Jame, who was here last night, was named after me.<br> It's common knowledge that something happened to your friendship.<br> It's no secret.<br> We were assigned to the same ship some years later.<br> I relieved him on watch once and found a circuit open to the atomic matter piles that should've been closed.<br> Another five minutes, it could have blown up the ship.<br> Ship nomenclature-- specify.<br> United Starship Republic, number 1371 .<br> Continue.<br> I closed the switch and logged the incident.<br> He drew a reprimand and was sent to the bottom of the promotion list.<br> And he blamed you for that? Yes.<br> He'd been at the academy for an unusually long time as an instructor.<br> As a result, he was late in being assigned to a starship.<br> The delay, he felt, looked bad on his record.<br> My action, he believed, made things worse.<br> Comment-- service record of Lieutenant Commander Finney to be appended this inquiry.<br> Noted.<br> Now, let's get into the specifics of the storm, Captain.<br> Weather scan indicated an ion storm dead ahead.<br> I sent Finney into the pod.<br> Why Finney? His name was at the top of the duty roster.<br> - If he blamed you-- - He may have blamed me that he never rose to command a ship, but I don't assign jobs on the basis of who blames me.<br> It was Finney's turn, and I assigned him.<br> He had just checked in with me from the pod when we hit the leading edge of the storm.<br> Not too bad at first.<br> I signaled a yellow alert.<br> Then we began encountering pressure, variant stress, force 7, the works.<br> I finally signaled a red alert.<br> Finney knew he had a matter of seconds.<br> I gave him those seconds and more.<br> But apparently it wasn't enough.<br> Then why, Captain, does the computer log from your ship, made automatically at the time, indicate that you were still on yellow alert when you jettisoned and not on red? I don't know.<br> - There's been a mistake.<br> - It would seem so.<br> Could the computer be wrong? Mr.<br> Spock is running a survey right now, but the odds are next to impossible.<br> Stop recording.<br> Now, look,Jim.<br> Not one man in a million could do what you and I have done-- command a starship.<br> A hundred decisions a day, hundreds of lives staked on you making every one of them right.<br> You're played out,Jim.<br> - Exhausted.<br> - Is that the way you see it? That's the way my report'll read ifyou cooperate.<br> Physical breakdown, possibly even mental collapse? - Possibly.<br> - I'd be admitting that a man died-- Admit nothing.<br> Say nothing.<br> Let me bury the matter here and now.<br> No starship captain has ever stood trial before, and I don't want you to be the first.<br> But if what you suspect is true, then I should be punished.<br> I'm thinking of the service.<br> I won't have it smeared.<br> By what, Commodore Stone? All right.<br> By an evident perjurer who's either covering his bad judgment, his cowardice, or-- That's as far as you go, sir.<br> I'm telling you I was there on the bridge.<br> I know what happened.<br> I know what I did.<br> It's in the transcript, and computer transcripts don't lie.<br> I'm telling you, Captain, either you accept a permanent ground assignment, or the whole disciplinary weight of Starfleet command is gonna light right on your neck.<br> So that's the way we do it now? Sweep it under the rug, and me along with it? Not on your life.<br> I intend to fight.<br> Then you draw a general court.<br> Draw it? I demand it.<br> And right now, Commodore Stone.<br> Right now.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 2948.<br>9.<br> The officers who will comprise my court-martial board are proceeding to Starbase 11.<br> Meanwhile, repairs on the Enterprise are almost complete.<br> Areel.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy said you were here.<br> I should have felt it in the air like static electricity.<br> Flattery will get you everywhere.<br> It's been-- How long has it been? Fouryears, seven months, and an odd number of days-- not that I'm counting.<br> You look marvelous.<br> You haven't changed a bit.<br> But things have changed foryou, haven't they? Oh, you've heard about that, have you? I'm a lawyer in thejudge advocate's office, remember? I remember.<br> Let's forget it.<br> We have a lot of lost time to make up for.<br> You're taking it very lightly.<br> - The confidence of an innocent man.<br> - Are you? Mm-hmm.<br> That's not what the rumors indicate.<br> Look, Let's not talk shop.<br> Jim, this could ruin you.<br> Will you take some advice? I never could talkyou into anything.<br> All right.<br> Fire away.<br> The prosecution will build its case on the basis of Kirk versus the computer.<br> Now, if your attorney tries to defend on that basis, you won't have a chance.<br> - Well, what other choice is there? - That's up to your attorney, and that's why he's got to be a good one.<br> You, perhaps? No.<br> I-- I'm busy.<br> Well, a girl with your ability should be able to handle two cases at once.<br> Jim, be serious.<br> You're not an ordinary human.<br> You're a Starship captain, and you've stepped into scandal.<br> If there's any way they can do it, they'll slap you down hard and permanently for the good of the service.<br> You still haven't made any recommendation.<br> Samuel T.<br> Cogley, attorney-at-law.<br> If anyone can save you, he can.<br> He'll be paying you a visit.<br> Jim, I've got to go.<br> Areel.<br> You still haven't told me how you know so much about what the prosecution's going to do.<br> Because,Jim Kirk, my dear old love, I am the prosecution, and I have to do my very best to have you slapped down hard, broken out of the service in disgrace.<br> You Kirk? Yes.<br> What is all this? I figure we'll be spending some time together, so I moved in.<br> I hope I'm not crowding you.<br> What's the matter? Don't you like books? Oh, I like them fine, but a computer takes less space.<br> [Scoffs] A computer, huh? I got one of these in my office.<br> Contains all the precedents, a synthesis of all the great legal decisions written throughout time.<br> - I never use it.<br> - Why not? I've got my own system.<br> Books, young man, books.<br> Thousands of them.<br> Iftime wasn't so important, I'd show you something-- my library.<br> Thousands of books.<br> - What would be the point? - This is where the law is, not in that homogenized, pasteurized, synthesized-- Do you want to know the law, the ancient concepts in their own language, Learn the intent of the men who wrote them, from Moses to the tribunal of Alpha 3? Books.<br> You have to be either an obsessive crackpot who's escaped from his keeper or Samuel T.<br> Cogley, attorney-at-law.<br> Right on both counts.<br> - Need a lawyer? - I'm afraid so.<br> This court is now in session.<br> I've appointed as members of this court Space Command Representative Lindstrom, Starship Captain Krasnovsky, and Chondra.<br> Captain Kirk, I direct your attention to the fact that you have a right to ask for substitute officers if you feel that any of these named harbor any prejudiced attitudes to your case.<br> I have no objections, sir.<br> Do you consent to the service Lieutenant Shaw as prosecuting officer and to myself as president of the court? I do, sir.<br> All right, clerk.<br> Charge-- culpable negligence.<br> Specification-- in that on Stardate 2945.<br>7, by such negligence, Captain Kirk,James T.<br>, did cause loss of life-- to wit, the life of Records Officer Lieutenant Commander Finney, Benjamin.<br> To all recorded charges and specifications, what is the plea? Not guilty.<br> Proceed, Lieutenant.<br> I call Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Spock, serial number S-179-276-SP.<br> Service rank-- Lieutenant Commander.<br> Position-- first officer, science officer.<br> Current assignment-- U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> Commendations-- Vulcanian Scientific Legion of Honor.<br> Awards of valor-- twice decorated by Starfleet command.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, as a first officer, you know a great deal about computers, don't you? I know all about them.<br> It is possible for a computer to malfunction, is it not? - Affirmative.<br> - Do you know of any malfunction which has caused an inaccuracy in the Enterprise computer? Negative.<br> That answer is based on your mechanical survey of the Enterprise computer ordered by the defendant prior to this trial, is it not? - Affirmative.<br> - Now the stardate-- But the computer is inaccurate, never the less.<br> Why do you say that? It reports that the jettison button was pressed before the red alert.<br> In other words, it reports that Captain Kirk was reacting to an extreme emergency that did not then exist.<br> - And that is impossible.<br> - Is it? Were you watching him the exact moment he pressed the jettison button? No.<br> I was occupied.<br> The ship was already on yellow alert.<br> Then how can you dispute the finding of the log? I do not dispute it.<br> I merely state that it is wrong.<br> Oh? On what do you base that statement? I know the captain.<br> He is in-- Please instruct the witness not to speculate.<br> Lieutenant, I am half Vulcanian.<br> Vulcanians do not speculate.<br> I speak from pure logic.<br> If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I need not see it fall to know that it has, in fact, fallen.<br> - I do not see what that has to-- - Gentlemen, human beings have characteristics just as inanimate objects do.<br> It is impossible for Captain Kirk to act out of panic or malice.<br> - It is not his nature.<br> - In your opinion.<br> Yes.<br> In my opinion.<br> Thank you.<br> - Your witness, Mr.<br> Cogley.<br> - No questions.<br> You may step down.<br> I now call the personnel officer for the Enterprise.<br> Service rank-- ensign.<br> Position-- personnel officer.<br> Current assignment-- U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> In the course of your duties as personnel officer of the Enterprise, you would be familiar with the service records of all aboard? Yes, ma'am.<br> With reference to Records Officer Finney, was there in his service record a reported disciplinary action for failure to close a circuit? Yes, ma'am.<br> Was the charge in that instance based upon a log entry by the officer who relieved him? - Yes, ma'am.<br> - And who was that officer? Ensign James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Louder, please, for the court.<br> Ensign James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Now the Captain Kirk who sits in this court room? - Yes, ma'am.<br> - Thank you.<br> Do you wish to cross-examine? No questions.<br> You may step down.<br> I now call Dr.<br> McCoy to the stand.<br> Service rank-- lieutenant commander.<br> Position-- ship's surgeon.<br> Current assignment-- U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> Commendations-- Legion of Honor.<br> Awards of valor-- decorated by Starfleet surgeons.<br> Doctor, you are, on the record, an expert in psychology, especially space psychology-- patterns which develop in the close quarters of a ship during long voyages in deep space.<br> I know something about it.<br> You havejust heard the testimony of your own personnel officer, that it was an action of the then Ensign Kirk which placed an unerasable blot on the record of the then Lieutenant Finney.<br> Psychologically, Doctor, is it possible that Lieutenant Finney blamed Kirk for the incident? It's possible.<br> He could have hated Kirk down through the years, blamed him for being passed over for promotion, blamed him for never being given a command of his own, correct? He could have.<br> Now, let us hypothesize, Doctor.<br> Is it normal for a person to return affection for hatred? - No.<br> - Do we not tend to, at first, resent and then actively dislike the person who hates us? Wait a minute.<br> I don't quite follow you.<br> Hypothetically.<br> Would not Captain Smith begin to hate Lieutenant Commander Jones once he learned that Lieutenant Commander Jones hated and detested him? Well, yes, I suppose it could happen.<br> Then I askyou, is it not possible that Captain Kirk became aware of Lieutenant Commander Finney's hatred toward him and perhaps, even involuntarily, began to reciprocate? Not Captain Kirk.<br> Any normal human, Doctor.<br> Is it possible? But he's not that kind of a man.<br> Is it theoretically possible, Doctor? Yes.<br> It's possible.<br> Thank you.<br> - Your witness, Mr.<br> Cogley.<br> - No questions.<br> You may step down.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley.<br> You've listened to testimony from three witnesses.<br> In neither instance have you availed yourself of your right to cross-examine.<br> Have you abrogated that right? Well, sir, truth is, I've been holding back till we get this preliminary business out of the way.<br> I'd like to call Captain Kirk to the stand.<br> James T.<br> Kirk, serial number SC-937-0176-CEC.<br> Service rank-- captain.<br> Position-- Starship command.<br> Current assignment-- U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> Commendations-- Palm Leaf Of Axinar Peace Mission, Grand Kite Order of Tactics, Class of Excellence, Frenterus Ribbon of Commendation, - Classes first and second-- - May it please the court.<br> Court recognizes counsel for the prosecution.<br> The prosecution concedes the inestimable record of Captain Kirk.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley? I wouldn't want to slow the wheels of progress.<br> But then on the other hand, I wouldn't want those wheels to run over my client in their unbridled haste.<br> Continue.<br> Awards of valor-- medal of honor, silverpalm with cluster, Starfleet citation for conspicuous gallantry, - Carragite Order of Heroism-- - Stop! I think that's enough.<br> I wouldn't want to slow things up too much.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, Captain, despite what these machines indicate, was there indeed a red alert before you jettisoned the pod? Yes, sir, there was.<br> Please tell us about it.<br> Firstly, I am at a loss to explain the errors in the extract from the computer log.<br> We were in an ion storm.<br> Everyone here in this court knows the dangers involved.<br> I was in command.<br> The decisions were mine, no one else's.<br> Charges of malice have been raised.<br> There was no malice.<br> Lieutenant Commander Finney was a member of my crew, and that's exactly the way he was treated.<br> It has been suggested that I panicked on the bridge and jettisoned the ion pod prematurely.<br> That is not so.<br> You've heard some of the details of my record.<br> This was not my first crisis.<br> It was one of many.<br> During it, I did what my experience and training required me to do.<br> I took the proper steps in the proper order.<br> I did exactly what had to be done exactly when it should have been done.<br> You did the right thing, but would you do it again? Given the same circumstances I would do the same thing without hesitation because the steps I took in the order I took them were absolutely necessary if I were to save my ship.<br> And nothing is more important than my ship.<br> Your witness, Miss Shaw.<br> The prosecution does not wish to dishonor this man, but facts are facts.<br> I must invite the attention of the court and Captain Kirk to this visual extract from the Enterprise computer log.<br> Playback.<br> What you are about to see is precisely what took place on the Enterprise bridge during the ion storm.<br> Meteorology reports ion storm upcoming, Captain.<br> We'll need somebody in the pod for readings.<br> Mr.<br> Finneyis top of duty roster, Captain.<br> Post him.<br> Attention, Commander Finney, report topod for reading on ion slates.<br> [Finney] Message Received.<br> Officer posted, Captain.<br> Standby on alert status, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Approaching ion storm, sir.<br> Warp factor 1, Mr.<br> Hanson.<br> Warp 1, sir.<br> Reverse.<br> Stop.<br> Go forward with magnification on the panel.<br> Freeze that.<br> Captain Kirk is now signaling a yellow alert.<br> Go forward, normal view.<br> Call from the pod, sir.<br> Tie in.<br> Finney here, Captain.<br> Ion readings in progress.<br> Make it fast, Ben.<br> I may have to go to red alert.<br> Affirmative.<br> - Holdy our course, Mr.<br> Hanson.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Natural vibrations, force 2, Captain.<br> - Force 3.<br> - Engineering, then ionpod.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Engineering.<br> - One-thirdmore thrust.<br> - Working.<br> - [Finney]ionpod.<br> Standby to get out of there, Ben.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Force 5, sir.<br> Steady as she goes, Mr.<br> Hanson.<br> Freeze that! If the court will notice, the log plainly shows the defendant's finger pressing the jettison button.<br> The condition signal reads yellow alert.<br> Not red alert, but simply yellow alert.<br> When the pod containing Lieutenant Commander Finney was jettisoned, the emergency did not as yet exist.<br> But that's not the way it happened.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 2949.<br>9.<br> The evidence presented by the visual playback to my general court-martial was damning.<br> I suspect even my attorney has begun to doubt me.<br> - Computers don't lie.<br> - Are you suggesting that I did? I'm suggesting that maybe you did have a lapse.<br> It was possible, you know, with the strain you were under.<br> There's still time to change our plea.<br> I could get you off.<br> Two days ago, I would've staked anything on my judgment.<br> You did.<br> Your professional career.<br> I spent my whole life training for decisionsjust like that one.<br> My whole life.<br> Is it possible that when the moment came, l-- No.<br> I know what I did.<br> You can pull out if you want to.<br> There's no place to go, except back to court and hear the verdict.<br> [Communicator Beeps] Kirk here.<br> Captain, I've run a complete megalyte survey on the computer.<br> I'll tell you what you found.<br> Nothing, right? You sound bitter, Captain.<br> Not bitter enough to forget to thank you for your efforts.<br> Further instructions? No.<br> It's not all bad, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Who knows.<br> You may be able to beat your next captain at chess.<br> Kirk out.<br> Chess.<br> Jame.<br> This is Lieutenant Commander Finney's daughter.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley, we've got to stop this.<br> Make him take a ground assignment.<br> I realize it wasn't his fault.<br> I won't make any trouble.<br> - Make him change his plea.<br> - It's too late for that,Jame.<br> But I'm glad you don't blame me anymore for what happened.<br> I was just so upset that night.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - Don't say any more.<br> - But I have to.<br> I never realized how close you and Dad had been until I read through some papers he wrote, Ietters to Mother and me.<br> I don't know how I ever could've thought that you-- Mr.<br> Cogley, ruining Jim won't change what's happened.<br> That's very commendable, Miss Finney, but most unusual.<br> After all, Captain Kirk is accused of causing your father's death, and the evidence would indicate his guilt.<br> - I was just thinking of Jim.<br> - I know, and I thank you.<br> I have to go and change.<br> You ready? No, but I may be getting ready.<br> Bishop, half level right.<br> - Well, I had to see it to believe it.<br> - Explain.<br> They're about to lop off the captain's professional head, and you're - playing chess with the computer.<br> - That is true.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you're the most cold-blooded man I've ever known.<br> Why, thank you, Doctor.<br> I'vejust won my fourth game.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - Observe for yourself.<br> Rook to king's pawn 4.<br> Bishop half level right.<br> Now, this is the computer's move.<br> And now mine.<br> Checkmate.<br> Mechanically, the computer's flawless.<br> Therefore, logically, its report of the captain's guilt is infallible.<br> I could not accept that, however.<br> So you tested the program bank.<br> Exactly.<br> I programmed it myself for chess some months ago.<br> The best I should've been able to attain was a draw.<br> Well, why are you just sitting there? Transporter room, stand by.<br> We're beaming down.<br> Court is now in session.<br> The board will entertain motions before delivering its verdict.<br> Counsel for the prosecution? Sir, the prosecution rests.<br> Counsel for the defense? Sir-- - The defense rests.<br> - [Door Opens] Mr.<br> Cogley.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley! Sir, some new evidence has just been brought to my attention.<br> - I'd like to ask the court-- - Objection! Counsel for the defense has rested his case.<br> - Of what nature is this evidence? - I can't tell you, I have to show you.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley is well-known for his theatrics.<br> Is saving an innocent man's career a theatric? Counsels will direct their remarks to the bench.<br> I'd be delighted to, sir, now that I've got something human to talk about.<br> Rights, sir, human rights-- the Bible, the Code of Hammurabi and of Justinian, Magna Carta, the Constitution of the United States, fundamental declarations of the Martian colonies, the statutes of Alpha 3-- Gentlemen, these documents all speak of rights.<br> Rights of the accused to a trial by his peers, to be represented by counsel, the rights of cross-examination, but most importantly, the right to be confronted by the witnesses against him-- a right to which my client has been denied.<br> Your Honor, that is ridiculous.<br> We produced the witnesses in court.<br> My learned opponent had the opportunity - to see them, cross-examine them-- - All but one! The most devastating witness against my client is not a human being.<br> It's a machine, an information system.<br> The computer log of the Enterprise.<br> I ask this court adjourn and reconvene aboard that vessel.<br> - I protest, Your Honor.<br> - And I repeat, I speak of rights.<br> A machine has none.<br> A man must.<br> My client has the right to face his accuser, and if you do not grant him that right, you have brought us down to the level of the machine.<br> Indeed, you have elevated that machine above us.<br> I ask that my motion be granted, and more than that, gentlemen, in the name of humanity, fading in the shadow of the machine, I demand it.<br> I demand it! Captain's Log, Stardate 2950.<br> 1.<br> After due consideration, the general court-martial has reconvened on board the Enterprise.<br> How many games of chess did you win from the computer, Mr.<br> Spock? Five in all.<br> - May that be considered unusual? - Affirmative.<br> Why? I personally programmed the computer for chess months ago.<br> I gave the machine an understanding of the game equal to my own.<br> The computer cannot make an error.<br> Assuming that I do not either, the best that could normally be hoped for would be stalemate after stalemate, and yet I beat the machine five times.<br> Someone, either accidentally or deliberately, adjusted the programming and, the refore, the memory banks of that computer.<br> Could that have had an effect on the visual playback we saw? Object! The witness would be making a conclusion.<br> - Sustained.<br> - Hypothetically, Mr.<br> Spock, hypothetically, Miss Shaw, if what you suggest had been done, it would be beyond the capabilities of most men.<br> - Is that true? - Affirmative.<br> What man aboard ship would it not be beyond? The captain, myself, and the records officer.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> And at the moment, you have no records officer.<br> Affirmative.<br> Until he was lost, our records officer was Lieutenant Commander Finney.<br> Captain Kirk, will you tell the steps you took to find Mr.<br> Finney after the storm? I instituted a Phase 1 search.<br> Describe a Phase 1 search.<br> It's a painstaking, thorough attempt in and around the ship to find a man who's unable to respond.<br> It presupposes, does it not, that a man wishes to be found? I beg your pardon? If you start a search for a man, you assume, don't you, that he wants to be found? Yes.<br> On a ship of this size, could a man evade such a search? Possibly.<br> Gentlemen, I submit to you that Lieutenant Commander Ben Finney is not dead.<br> Mr.<br> Cogley, we are waiting for proof of your extraordinary statement.<br> You shall have it, but first I need the court's cooperation in conducting an experiment.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Gentlemen, for this experiment, it'll be necessary for all personnel, except for the court and the command crew, to leave the ship.<br> I am ordering all others to report to the transporter room.<br> - Including myself, sir.<br> - This court is not adjourned.<br> I have an errand ashore of vital importance to this court.<br> - I will return.<br> - Very well.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Captain, are you maintaining an engine crew aboard? Our impulse engines have been shut down.<br> We'll maintain orbit by momentum.<br> When the orbit decays? We hope to be finished long before that.<br> Ready, Mr.<br> Spock? Affirmative, Captain.<br> Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor.<br> It can, in effect, hear sounds.<br> By installing a booster, we can increase that capability on the order of The computer should bring us every sound occurring on the ship.<br> All personnel have left the ship as ordered, sir.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy? All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> [Loud Beating] Turn it down a little.<br> [Volume Decreases] Gentlemen, that sound is caused by the heartbeats of all the people on board the ship.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy will use this white sound device to mask out each person's heartbeat so that it will be eliminated from the sounds we're hearing.<br> First, the captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> And lastly, myself.<br> That's all of us, except for crewman in the transporter room.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, eliminate his heartbeat.<br> [Heartbeat Continues] That accounts for everyone.<br> [Single Heart Beats] Finney.<br> Localize that.<br> \"B\" Deck.<br> In or near Engineering.<br> Seal off \"B\" Deck, sections 18-Y through 23-D.<br> Acknowledged.<br> [Beep] So Finney is alive.<br> It would seem so.<br> Commodore, this is my problem.<br> I'd appreciate it if no one left the bridge.<br> Sam Cogley had gone a shore to bring Jame Finney on board.<br> We felt Jame's presence would make Finney easierto handle in the event Finney really were alive.<br> Ben.<br> [Kirk] Ben Finney.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, encountering variants.<br> - Compensate.<br> - What is happening? The orbit's beginning to decay.<br> Ben, where are you? Hello, Captain! Nothing to say, Captain? I'm glad you're alive.<br> You mean you're relieved because you think your career is saved.<br> Well,you're wrong.<br> Ben! Ben, it's not too late.<br> We can help you.<br> Like you helped me all along, kept me down, robbed me of my own command? I'm a good officer.<br> As good as you.<br> I've watched you for years.<br> The great Captain Kirk.<br> They told you to do it to me.<br> You all conspired against me.<br> You ruined me, but you won't do it anymore.<br> Uhh.<br> Put the phaser down, Ben.<br> Oh, I wouldn't kill you, Captain.<br> Your own death would mean too little to you, But your ship-- What about my ship? It's dead.<br> I've killed it.<br> I tapped out your primary energy circuits.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, what's our orbit status?

They killed me, didn't they? It's a fair trade.<br> Is Jame included in that deal? What do you mean? She's on board by now.<br> Yes.<br> She's on board.<br> Why did you do that?

Those like you and me, who resist Landru.<br> An underground.<br> How are you organized? In threes-- myself, Tamar, who's dead now, and one other.<br> Who? I don't know.<br> Tamar was my contact.<br> Give me a decision, Captain.<br> He's coming out of it.<br> He must not regain consciousness.<br> He'll destroy us all.<br> He's of the body.<br> Give him a shot.<br> Keep him asleep.<br> Reger I want some answers.<br> This underground-- If Landru's so powerful, how do you survive? I don't know, Captain.<br> Some of us escaped the directives.<br> Not many, but a few.<br> It was that way when the first Archons came.<br> The Archons, tell me about them.<br> They had invaded the body, but they resisted the will of Landru.<br> You see, Landru had pulled them down from the skies.<br> Pulled them down from the skies? A starship? Mr.<br> Spock, those power readings you took, are they Powerful enough to destroy a starship? Affirmative.<br> Kirk to Enterprise, come in.<br> Captain, we're under attack.<br> There are heat beams of some kind coming up from the planet's surface.<br> Our shields are holding, but they're taking all our power.<br> If we try to move, we'll lose our shields and burn up like a cinder.<br> Orbit condition.<br> Checking.<br> We're going down, Captain.<br> Unless we can get those beams off us so we can use our engines, we're due to hit atmosphere in 12 hours.<br> Keep your shield up.<br> Do everything you can to maintain orbit.<br> We'll try and locate the beam's source and stop it here.<br> Impossible to breakaway.<br> The emergency bypass circuits haven't been effective.<br> [Static] [Spock] Captain.<br> What is it? Sensor beams, very strong.<br> We're being probed in this direction.<br> Landru.<br> Block them out.<br> Too strong, Captain.<br> Can't be blocked.<br> [Probing] Ooh I am Landru.<br> Projection, Captain.<br> Unreal.<br> But beautiful, Mr.<br> Spock, with no apparatus at this end.<br> You have come as destroyers.<br> You bring an infection.<br> You are holding my ship.<br> I demand that you release it.<br> You have come to a world without hate, without fear, without conflict no war no disease no crime none of the ancient evils.<br> Landru seeks tranquillity peace for all the universal good.<br> We mean you no harm.<br> Ours is a mission of peace and good will.<br> The good must transcend the evil.<br> It shall be done.<br> So it has been since the beginning.<br> He doesn't hear you, Captain.<br> Maybe he'll hear this.<br> Put that away.<br> Landru Listen to me.<br> You will be absorbed.<br> Your individuality will merge into the unity of good, and in your submergence into the common being of the body, you will find contentment and fulfillment.<br> You will experience the absolute good.<br> Ohh [High Pitched Noise] Captain 's log.<br> Stardate 3157.<br>4-- The Enterprise, still under attack by some sort of heat rays from the surface of Beta 3, is now being commanded by Engineering Officer Scott.<br> The shore party has been taken by the creature called Landru.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Wake up.<br> Mr.<br> Leslie.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy? He was gone when I woke up, along with the other guard and Mr.<br> O'Neil.<br> I should say they've been here and been removed.<br> Where is here? Evidently a maximum-security establishment.<br> Are you armed? All our phasers are gone.<br> I checked.<br> That's locked.<br> Ohh.<br> Oh, does my headache.<br> The natural result of being subjected to a hypersonic.<br> Oh.<br> Is that what it was? Sound waves.<br> Stronger, they might have killed.<br> They merely rendered us unconscious.<br> Enough analysis.<br> Let's think ofa way to get out of here.<br> What about the Lawgivers' inability to cope with the unexpected? You shouldn't depend on that happening again, Captain.<br> In a society as well organized as this one seems to be, I cannot conceive of such an oversight going uncorrected.<br> Interesting, however-- their reaction to your defiance was remarkably similar to the reaction of a computer when fed insufficient or contradictory data.<br> Are you suggesting that the Lawgivers are mere computers, that they aren't human? Quite human, Captain.<br> It's simply that all the facts are not yet in.<br> There are gaps.<br> [Door Opens] Doc.<br> How-- Hello, friend.<br> We were told to wait here.<br> Doc.<br> Can I help you, friend? Don't you know me? We all know one another in Landru.<br> Like Sulu.<br> Think, man.<br> The Enterprise.<br> The ship.<br> Remember? You speak very strangely, friend.<br> Are you from away? You do remember! Ask Landru.<br> He remembers.<br> He knows, and he watches.<br> You are strange.<br> Are you not of the body? Come.<br> No.<br> Then you will die.<br> You've been corrected, Captain.<br> You'd better go.<br> All right.<br> Work on Bones.<br> See if you can't-- Come.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, what will happen to him? He goes to joy, peace, and tranquillity.<br> He goes to meet Landru.<br> Happiness is to all of us blessed by Landru.<br> I am Marplon.<br> It is your hour.<br> Happy communing.<br> With thanks.<br> Happy communing.<br> Well? Impossible.<br> He's under extremely powerful control.<br> Are we just going to stand here? Little else we can do unless you can think of a way to get through that door.<br> Well, this is simply ridiculous-- a bunch of stone-age characters running around in robes.<br> And apparently commanding powers far beyond our comprehension.<br> Not simple.<br> Not ridiculous.<br> Very, very dangerous.<br> You come.<br> Joy to you, friend.<br> Peace and contentment will fill you.<br> You will know the peace of Landru.<br> Have no fear, friend.<br> The effect is harmless.<br> My name is Marplon.<br> I was too late to save your first two friends.<br> They have been absorbed.<br> Beware of them.<br> What about the captain? He is unharmed, unchanged.<br> I am the third man in Reger's triad.<br> We have been awaiting your return.<br> We are not Archons, Marplon.<br> Whatever you may call yourselves, you are in fulfillment of prophecy.<br> We ask your help.<br> Where is Reger? He will join us.<br> He is immune to absorption.<br> Hurry.<br> We have not much time.<br> Who is Landru? I cannot answer your questions now.<br> Landru, he will hear.<br> Here are your weapons.<br> You may need them.<br> Behave as you saw your captain behave.<br> It is done.<br> Joy be with you.<br> Peace and contentment.<br> Captain-- Peace and tranquillity to you.<br> Are you all right? Quite all right.<br> Be careful of Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I understand.<br> Landru.<br> I am formulating a theory, Captain.<br> And? Not here.<br> The doctor.<br> You speak in strange whispers.<br> This is not the way of Landru.<br> Joy be yours-- and tranquillity, my friend.<br> And peace and harmony.<br> Are you of the body? The body is one.<br> Blessed be the body and health to all of its parts.<br> My friends What is your theory, Mr.<br> Spock? This is a soulless society, Captain.<br> It has no spirit, no spark.<br> All is peace and tranquillity-- the peace of the factory, the tranquillity of the machine, all parts working in unison.<br> And when something unexplained happens Their routine is disrupted? Until new orders are received.<br> The question is, who gives those orders? Landru.<br> There is no Landru, Captain, not in the human sense.<br> You're thinking the same thing I am.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the plug must be pulled.<br> Sir? Landru must die.<br> Captain, our prime directive of noninterference.<br> That refers to a living, growing culture.<br> Do you think this one is? Joy to you all, friends.<br> It is the gift of Landru.<br> I brought your signaling devices.<br> You may need them.<br> What we really need is more information about Landru.<br> You said you wanted us to help you.<br> Prophecy says-- Never mind what the prophecy says.<br> If you want to be liberated from Landru, we'll need your help.<br> Captain.<br> You're not of the body! Peace You're not! to you, friend.<br> Lawgivers! Peace.<br> Lawgivers! Traitor! Traitors! Traitors! [Kirk] I don't want to hurt you.<br> Traitors! [Kirk] Aw, Doc Spock.<br> Isn't that somewhat old-fashioned? The robes.<br> Where is Landru? No.<br> No.<br> Where do we find him? We do not see him.<br> We hear him in the Hall of Audiences.<br> In this building? Yes.<br> You're going to take us there.<br> No.<br> Spock, call the Enterprise.<br> No.<br> Snap out of it! Start acting like men.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> status report.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I've been trying to reach you.<br> Report, Scott.<br> The orbit's still decaying.<br> Give it six hours, more or less.<br> Those heat beams are still on us.<br> If you don't cut them off, we'll cook.<br> Scotty, stand by.<br> We're doing the best we can.<br> How's Mr.<br> Sulu? He's peaceful enough, but he worries me.<br> Put a guard on him.<br> On Sulu? That's an order.<br> Watch him.<br> Captain out.<br> Captain.<br> All right.<br> About Landru.<br> Well, there was war, convulsions.<br> The world was destroying itself.<br> Landru was our leader.<br> He saw the truth.<br> He changed the world.<br> He took us back, back to a simple time, a time of peace and tranquillity.<br> What happened to him? He's still alive.<br> He is here now.<br> He sees.<br> He hears.<br> We have destroyed ourselves.<br> Please go on.<br> You said you wanted freedom.<br> It's time you learned that freedom is never a gift.<br> It has to be earned.<br> Come on.<br> We're going to find Landru.<br> No! No! I was wrong! I submit! I bear myself to the will of Landru! It's too late for that.<br> No! No! Give us help! Help me! All right, it's up to you.<br> Take us to Landru.<br> This is the Hall of Audiences.<br> Open it.<br> But this is Landru.<br> Open it.<br> Landru speaks here.<br> Landru! Landru! We are the Archons! We are the Archons! We've come to speak! We are the Archons.<br> We want to talk to you.<br> Landru! He comes! Despite my efforts to save you, you have invaded the body, and you are causing great harm.<br> We have no intention of causing harm.<br> Obliteration is necessary.<br> The infection is strong.<br> For the good of the body, you must die.<br> It is a great sorrow.<br> We do not intend to die.<br> All who saw you, all who know of your presence here must be excised.<br> The memory of the body will be cleansed.<br> Listen to me.<br> Useless, Captain.<br> A projection.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Let's have a look at the projector.<br> Of course.<br> It had to be.<br> Landru? A machine.<br> This whole society is a machine's concept of perfection-- peace, harmony But no soul.<br> I am Landru.<br> You have intruded.<br> Pull out its plug, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your devices have been neutralized.<br> So it shall be with you.<br> I am Landru.<br> Landru died I am Landru.<br> I am he.<br> All that he was I am-- his experience, his knowledge.<br> But not his wisdom.<br> He may have programmed you, but he could not have given you a soul.<br> You are a machine.<br> Your statement is irrelevant.<br> You will be obliterated.<br> The good of the body is the prime directive.<br> The good of the body, Captain.<br> That's the key.<br> Yes.<br> What is the good? I am Landru.<br> Landru is dead.<br> You are a machine.<br> A question has been asked.<br> Answer it.<br> The good is the harmonious continuation of the body.<br> The good is peace, tranquillity.<br> The good of the body is the directive.<br> Then I put it to you that you have disobeyed the prime directive.<br> You are harmful to the body.<br> The body is.<br> It exists.<br> It is healthy.<br> The body is dying.<br> You are destroying it.<br> Do you ask a question? What have you done to do justice to the full potential of every individual of the body? Insufficient data.<br> Without freedom of choice, there is no creativity.<br> Without creativity, there is no life.<br> The body dies.<br> The fault is yours.<br> Are you aiding the body, or are you destroying it? I am notprogrammed to answer that question.<br> Landru! Guide us! Landru! Not necessary, Captain.<br> They have no guidance, possibly for the first time in their lives.<br> Landru answer the question.<br> Peace, order, and tranquillity are maintained.<br> The body lives, but I reserve creativity to me.<br> Then the body dies.<br> Creativity is necessary for the health ofthe body.<br> This is impossible! Is this truly Landru? What's left of him after he built and programmed this machine You must create the good.<br> That is the will of Landru, nothing else.<br> But there is evil.<br> Then the evil must be destroyed.<br> That is the prime directive, and you are the evil.<br> I think.<br> I live.<br> You are the evil.<br> The evil must be destroyed.<br> Fulfill the prime directive.<br> - You - Landru, help me! are the evil.<br> Fulfill the prime directive.<br> Help me! Help me! Help me! Help me! Well, Marplon, you're on your own now.<br> I hope you're up to it.<br> You can get rid of those robes.<br> If I were you, I'd look for another job.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> come in.<br> Captain, are you all right? What about the ship? The heat rays have gone, Captain, and Mr.<br> Sulu's back to normal.<br> Relieving you.<br> Excellent, Scotty.<br> Stand by to beam up landing party.<br> Let's go see how the others are doing.<br> Marplon can finish up here.<br> Captain 's log.<br> Stardate 3158.<br>7-- The Enterprise is preparing to leave Beta 3 in Starsystem C-111.<br> Sociologist Lindstrom is remaining behind with a party of experts who will restore the planet's culture to a human form.<br> Marvelous.<br> What? The late Landru, Captain.<br> A marvelous feat of engineering.<br> A computer capable of directing the lives of millions of human beings.<br> But only a machine, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The original Landru programmed it with all his knowledge but couldn't give it his wisdom, his compassion, his understanding, his soul, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Predictably metaphysical.<br> I prefer the concrete, the graspable, the provable.<br> You would make a splendid computer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is very kind of you, Captain.<br> [Uhura] Captain, Mr.<br> Lindstrom from the surface.<br> Yes, Lindstrom.<br> Just wanted to say goodbye, Captain.<br> How's it going? Couldn 't be better.<br> Already this morning, we've had six domestic quarrels and two genuine knock-down drag-outs.<br> It may not be paradise, but it's certainly human.<br> Sounds most promising.<br> Good luck.<br> How often mankind has wished for a world as peaceful and secure as the one Landru provided.<br> Yes.<br> And we never got it.<br> Just lucky, I guess.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Well, if you're actually giving me a choice-- I'm not.<br> Oh, I'll need somebody familiar with the late Here's a chance for that historian to do something for a change.<br> What's her name uh, McIverÂs? Lieutenant McGivers.<br> Attention-- the following personnel report to transporter room-- Engineering Officer Scott, Lieutenant McGivers.<br> Acknowledge.<br> McGivers.<br> On my way.<br> Well, it looks like that ship is expecting us.<br> We read heat coming on, complete oxygen atmosphere.<br> Very interesting.<br> You ready, Bones? No.<br> I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine, not to have my atoms scattered across space by this gadget.<br> You're an old-fashioned boy, McCoy.<br> Where's that historian? Come on, Lieutenant, uh McGivers, sir.<br> Energize.<br> Scotty? Definitely Earth-type mechanisms, sir.<br> old-type atomic power, bulky, solid I think they used to call them transistor units.<br> I'd love to tear this baby apart.<br> Captain, it's a sleeper ship.<br> Suspended animation.<br> Uh-huh.<br> I've seen old photographs of this.<br> Necessary because of the time involved in space travel until about the year 2018.<br> It took years just to travel from one planet to another.<br> Is it possible they're still alive after centuries of travel? It's theoretically possible.<br> I've never heard of it being tested for this long a period.<br> What a handsome group of people.<br> Jim, I have a new reading.<br> The lights must have triggered some mechanism.<br> Captain, look here.<br> Scotty? Beats me what's happening.<br> We've triggered something, all right.<br> The heart beat's increasing-- Now passing eight beats per minute-- And there are some signs of respiration beginning.<br> This one was probably programmed to be triggered first.<br> Could he be the leader? The leader.<br> Lieutenant? Yes, sir.<br> The leader was often set to revive first.<br> This would allow him to decide whether the conditions warranted revival of the others.<br> Heart beat now approaching The respiration pattern is firming up.<br> From the northern India area, I'd guess.<br> Probably a Sikh.<br> They were the most fantastic warriors.<br> Heart beat now 52 and increasing.<br> The others? No change, and they're mixed types-- Western, mid-European, Latin, Oriental.<br> A man from the 20th century coming alive.<br> Maybe.<br> Heart beat dropping.<br> Circuit shorting.<br> Probably some dust.<br> Heartbeat now 30, dropping fast.<br> There's a heart flutter.<br> He's dying.<br> Do something, Captain.<br> Can we? Take an hour to figure out.<br> What happens if we get him out? He'll die in seconds if we don't.<br> Howlong? How longhave you been sleeping? Two centuries we estimate.<br> Landing party to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Go ahead, boarding party.<br> We read you.<br> Lock in on McCoy's beam.<br> He's transporting back with a casualty we discovered here.<br> Magnificent.<br> Captain 's Log, supplemental-- Along side the S.<br>S.<br> Botany Bay for 10 hours now.<br> A boarding party of engineering and medical specialists are now completing their examination of the mysterious vessel.<br> Attempts to revive other sleepers await our success or failure with the casualty already beamed over.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is frankly amazed at his physical and recuperative power.<br> Kirk to boarding party.<br> Scott here.<br> Scotty, any records, log books of any kind? Negative.<br> They were in suspended animation when the ship took off.<br> How many alive? Leaving 72 still operating.<br> Kirk out.<br> a group of people dating back into the 1990s.<br> A discovery of some importance, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> There are a great many unanswered questions about those years.<br> A strange, violent period in your history.<br> I find no record what so ever of an S.<br>S.<br> Botany Bay.<br> Captain, the DY 100 class vessel was designed for interplanetary travel only.<br> With simple nuclear-powered engines, star travel was considered impractical at that time.<br> It was 10,000-to-1 against their making it to another star system.<br> And why no record of the trip? Botany Bay That was the name of a penal colony on the shores of Australia, wasn't it? If they took that name for their vessel If you're suggesting this was a penal deportation vessel, you've arrived at a totally illogical conclusion.<br> Oh? Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages.<br> Whole populations were being bombed out of existence.<br> Criminals could have been dealt with far more efficiently than wasting one of their most advanced spaceships.<br> Yes.<br> So much for my theory.<br> I'm still waiting to hear yours.<br> Even a theory requires some facts, Captain.<br> So far I have none.<br> And that irritates you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Irritation? Yeah.<br> I am not capable of that emotion.<br> My apologies, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You suspect some danger in them? Insufficient facts always invite danger, Captain.<br> Well, I'd better get some facts.<br> Rig for towing.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Make course for Star base 12.<br> Aye, sir.<br> That will be all.<br> Bones? He'll live.<br> My compliments.<br> No, I'm good, but not that good.<br> There's something inside this man that refuses to accept death.<br> Now, look at that-- Even as he is now, his heart valve action has twice the power of ours, Lung efficiency 50% better.<br> An improved breed of human.<br> That's what the Eugenics War was all about.<br> I'd estimate he could lift us both with one arm.<br> Be interesting to see if his brain matches his body.<br> Doctor, will he live? It appears he will, Lieutenant.<br> I'd like to talk to you.<br> If I were to rate your performance today-- I know, sir.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Lieutenant, at any one time, the safety of this entire vessel might depend upon a single crewman, and the fact that you find a man strangely compelling to you personally-- Not personally, Captain.<br> Professionally.<br> My profession is historian, and to find a specimen from the past alive-- I mean, the sheer delight of examining his mind.<br> And men were more adventure some then bolder, more colorful? Yes, sir, I think they were.<br> Good.<br> If I can have honesty, it's easier to overlook mistakes.<br> That's all.<br> Yes, sir.<br> A pity you wasted your life on command, Jim.<br> You'd have made a fair psychologist.<br> Fair? Sick bay to Lab.<br> Anything new on those bios? They all came out fine, Doctor.<br> Good.<br> McCoy out.<br> Well, either choke me or cut my throat.<br> Make up your mind.<br> English.<br> I thought I dreamed hearing it.<br> Where am I? You're-- You're in bed, holding a knife at your doctor's throat.<br> Answer my question.<br> It would be most effective if you would cut the carotid artery Just under the left ear.<br> I like a brave man.<br> I was simply trying to avoid an argument.<br> You're aboard the United Spaceship Enterprise.<br> Your vessel is in tow.<br> I remember a voice Did I hear it say I had been sleeping for two centuries? That is correct.<br> Where is your captain? I have many questions.<br> Bridge.<br> I have a patient here with many questions, Captain.<br> On my way.<br> James Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise.<br> I see.<br> And your name? I have a few questions first.<br> What is your heading? Our heading is Star base 12, a planet in the Gamma 400 star system-- our command base in this sector.<br> Is that of any use to you? And, um my people? are still functioning.<br> You will revive them.<br> As soon as we reach Star base 12.<br> I see.<br> And now Khan is my name.<br> Khan--nothing else? Khan.<br> What was the exact date of your lift off? We know it was sometime in the early 1990s.<br> I find myself growing fatigued, Doctor.<br> May we continue this questioning at some other time? The facts I need will take very little time.<br> For example, the nature of your expedition-- Jim Later might be better.<br> Captain, I wonder if I could have something to read during my convalescence.<br> I was once an engineer of sorts.<br> I would be most interested in studying the technical manuals on your vessel.<br> Yes, I understand.<br> You have 200 years of catching up to do.<br> Precisely.<br> They're available to any patient on the viewing screen.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy will show you how to tie into the library tapes.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> You are very cooperative.<br> This Khan is not what I expected of a 20th century man.<br> I note he's making considerable use of our technical library.<br> Common courtesy, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> He'll spend the rest of his days in our time.<br> It's only decent to help him catch up.<br> Would you estimate him to be a product of selective breeding? There is that possibility, Captain.<br> His age would be correct.<br> In 1993, a group of these young supermen did seize power simultaneously in over 40 nations.<br> Well, they were hardly supermen.<br> They were aggressive, arrogant.<br> They began to battle among themselves.<br> Because the scientists overlooked one fact-- Superior ability breeds superior ambition.<br> Interesting, if true.<br> They created a group of AlexanderÂs, Napoleons.<br> I have collected some names and made some counts.<br> By my estimate, there were some 80 or 90 of these young supermen unaccounted for when they were finally defeated.<br> That fact isn't in the history texts.<br> Would you reveal to war-weary populations that some 80 Napoleons might still be alive? Ship's historian, Lieutenant-- Marla McGivers.<br> Yes.<br> I am told you participated in my rebirth.<br> In a small way.<br> I've been reading up on starships, but they have one luxury not mentioned in the manuals.<br> I don't understand.<br> A beautiful woman.<br> My name is Khan.<br> Please sit and entertain me.<br> I'd like some historical information about your ship, its purpose and-- Why do you wear your hair in such an uncomplimentary fashion? It's comfortable.<br> But it's not attractive.<br> There soft natural simple.<br> Mr.<br> Khan, I'm here on business.<br> You find no pleasure here? My interest is scientific.<br> Men of-- That is, the world of the past-- I'm sure you understand to actually talk to a man of your century-- There simple soft Please remember.<br> Perhaps some other time, when you feel more like talking about the past.<br> I'm glad you came.<br> Please do it again.<br> Very impressive.<br> Are we expecting a fleet admiral for dinner? Lieutenant McGivers' idea to welcome Khan to our century.<br> Just how strongly is she attracted to him? Well, there aren't any regulations against romance, Jim.<br> My curiosity is official, not personal, Bones.<br> Well, he has a magnetism, almost electric-- you felt it-- and it could over power McGivers with her preoccupation with the past.<br> Thank you.<br> I hoped, uh, you might guide me to our dinner engagement.<br> Very good.<br> Fine technique.<br> It's a gladiator named Flavius.<br> He once--- And you've rearranged your hair for me.<br> Excellent.<br> All bold men from the past.<br> Richard, Leif Eriksson, Napoleon.<br> A hobby of yours, such men? I am honored.<br> Thank you.<br> But I caution you.<br> Such men dare take what they want.<br> Forgive my curiosity, Mr.<br> Khan, but my officers are anxious to know more about your extraordinary journey.<br> And how you managed to keep it out of the history books.<br> Adventure, Captain.<br> Adventure.<br> There was little else left on Earth.<br> There was the war to end tyranny.<br> Many considered that a noble effort.<br> Tyranny, sir? Or an attempt to unify humanity? Unify, sir? Like a team of animals under one whip? I know something of those years, remember.<br> It was a time of great dreams, of great aspiration.<br> Under dozens of petty dictator ships.<br> One man would have ruled eventually, as Rome under Caesar.<br> Think of its accomplishments.<br> Then your sympathies were with-- You are an excellent tactician, Captain.<br> You let your second-in-command attack while you sit and watch for weakness.<br> You have a tendency to express ideas in military terms, Mr.<br> Khan.<br> This is a social occasion.<br> It has been said that social occasions are only warfare concealed.<br> Many prefer it more honest, more open.<br> You fled.<br> Were you afraid? I've never been afraid.<br> You left at the very time mankind needed courage.<br> We offered the world order! We? Excellent.<br> Excellent.<br> But if you will excuse me, gentlemen and ladies, I grow fatigued again.<br> With your permission, Captain, I will return to my quarters.<br> [Door Buzzes] I wanted to apologize.<br> They had no right to treat you that way.<br> Quite understandable, since I'm something of a mystery to them.<br> You're no mystery to me.<br> I know exactly who you are.<br> Do you? Mm-hmm.<br> Leif Eriksson, Richard the Lion-Hearted, Napoleon.<br> I don't know if you'll like living in our time.<br> Then I'll have to remold it to my liking.<br> Please don't.<br> Go.<br> Or stay.<br> But do it because it is what you wish to do.<br> Well? I'll stay a little longer.<br> How many minutes do you graciously offer? I only meant-- This grows tiresome.<br> You must now ask to stay.<br> I'd like to stay.<br> Please.<br> Open your heart.<br> Will you open your heart? Yes.<br> I intend to take this ship.<br> Do you agree? Oh, please don't ask me-- I need your help.<br> You won't harm anyone? Now you question me? No.<br> Will you assist me? Oh, please, Khan, don't ask me-- Leave me then.<br> Go, I say.<br> No.<br> I promise.<br> I'll do anything you ask.<br> Name-- Khan, as we know him today.<br> Name-- Khan Noonien Singh.<br> From 1992 through 1996, absolute ruler of more than a quarter of your world, from Asia through the Middle East.<br> The last of the tyrants to be overthrown.<br> I must confess, gentlemen.<br> I've always held a sneaking admiration for this one.<br> He was the best of the tyrants and the most dangerous.<br> They were supermen in a sense.<br> Stronger, braver, certainly more ambitious, more daring.<br> Gentlemen, this romanticism about a ruthless dictator is-- Mr.<br> Spock, we humans have a streak of barbarism in us.<br> Appalling, but there, nevertheless.<br> There were no massacres under his rule.<br> And as little freedom.<br> No wars until he was attacked.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you misunderstand us.<br> We can be against him and admire him all at the same time.<br> Illogical.<br> Totally.<br> This is the captain.<br> Put a 24-hour security on Mr.<br> Khan's quarters, effective immediately.<br> Ahh.<br> I'm sorry, Captain.<br> I was, um, Lost in thought.<br> My door-- Locked from outside, a guard posted.<br> Unusual treatment for Khan Noonien Singh.<br> Excellent.<br> You identified me with your computer system, I imagine.<br> I'd like those answers now.<br> First the purpose of your star flight.<br> A new life, a chance to build a world other things I doubt you would understand.<br> Why? Because I'm not a product of controlled genetics? Captain, although your abilities intrigue me, you are quite honestly inferior.<br> Mentally, physically.<br> In fact, I am surprised how little improvement there has been in human evolution.<br> Oh, there has been technical advancement, but, uh, how little man himself has changed.<br> Yes, it appears we will do well in your century, Captain.<br> Do you have any other questions? Thank you.<br> They've all been answered.<br> Move away.<br> Otto.<br> Joaquin.<br> The trip is over.<br> The battle begins again.<br> Only this time it's not a world we win.<br> It's a universe.<br> Kati.<br> On course, sir.<br> Warp factor two.<br> Maintain.<br> [Beep Beep] Bridge.<br> Captain, Security here.<br> Khan's escaped.<br> Sound security alert.<br> Security alert, Captain.<br> Communication channels are jammed, Captain.<br> Turbo elevators inoperative.<br> Jammed, Captain.<br> Atmospheric controls cut off.<br> Useless.<br> They're on override in Engineering.<br> Engineering.<br> Scotty.<br> This is the bridge.<br> Captain! What's going on? He's not able to answer you at the moment, Captain.<br> Your ship is mine.<br> I have shut off the life support system to your bridge, jammed up your exit routes.<br> I am willing to negotiate.<br> Flood all decks with neural gas.<br> Impossible.<br> Intruder control systems inoperative.<br> Mr.<br> Khan was very thorough in his study of our tech manuals.<br> Contact Star base 12.<br> All channels are totally jammed, Captain.<br> Brilliant.<br> Every contingency anticipated.<br> Your air should be getting quite thin by now.<br> Do you surrender the bridge? Negative.<br> Academic, Captain.<br> Refuse, and every person on the bridge will suffocate.<br> Star date-- 3142.<br>8.<br> They have my ship, discarding their own worthless vessel.<br> Only moments of air left on the bridge now.<br> Commendations recommended for Lieutenant Uhura, Technicians First Class Thule and Harrison Lieutenant Spinelli and, of course, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I take full responsibility I take full-- Nothing ever changes, except man.<br> Your technical accomplishments? Improve a mechanical device and you may double productivity.<br> But improve man and you gain a thousand fold.<br> I am such a man.<br> Join me.<br> I'll treat you well.<br> I need your training to operate a vessel this complex.<br> Where is Captain Kirk? I see now I made one serious error.<br> You are the communications officer? Engage the viewing screen, please.<br> No! I should have realized that suffocating together on the bridge would create heroic camaraderie among you.<br> But it is quite a different thing to watch it happening to someone else.<br> Engage the viewing screen.<br> I'm sure you recognize your medical decompression chamber here, Doctor and the meaning of that indicator.<br> Your captain will die.<br> If you join me, Mr.<br> Spock, I will save his life.<br> My vessel was useless.<br> I need you and yours to select a colony planet, one with a population willing to be led by us.<br> To be conquered by you.<br> A starship would make that most simple, wouldn't it? Each of you in turn will go in there die while the others watch.<br> Khan.<br> There's no reason I must watch this, is there? But I hoped you would be stronger.<br> If any one of you joins me, any one I'll let him live.<br> It's so useless! [Beep Beep] We've lost the channel.<br> How do I regain picture? It does not matter.<br> The captain is dead.<br> Take Mr.<br> Spock next.<br> Khan said to watch him very closely.<br> He may decide to cooperate.<br> Captain, I saved your life.<br> Now please don't kill him.<br> Surprised to see you, Captain, though pleased.<br> I'm a little pleased myself.<br> Situation? Khan is holding our staff in the briefing room.<br> His men have control of the ship.<br> Our only chance is the intruder control circuit.<br> Although it's cut off.<br> There's a relay junction down the corridor.<br> Gas all decks but this one.<br> Armory, this is Khan.<br> Report.<br> Rodriguez.<br> Ling.<br> McPherson.<br> Anyone, report status.<br> Where's Khan? He got out Just as the gas-- [Beep] Kirk here.<br> Anesthesia gas in all sections except Engineering.<br> Someone just closed that line.<br> Captain, acknowledge.<br> Unable to flood Engineering section.<br> This is Scott.<br> Captain 's headed for the Engineering section.<br> I'll following case-- Negative.<br> We must retake the vessel while the anesthesia lasts.<br> Meet me in the armory.<br> I'm blowing it clear first.<br> Spock out.<br> [Beep Beep] If I understood your manuals, that's an overload in progress.<br> Your ship flares up like an exploding sun within minutes.<br> I have five times your strength.<br> You're no match for me.<br> Captain 's Log.<br> Star date 3143.<br>3.<br> Control of the Enterprise has been regained.<br> I wish my next decisions were no more difficult.<br> Khan and his people-- What a waste to put them in a reorientation center.<br> And what do I do about McGivers? Record tapes engaged and ready, Captain.<br> [Ding Ding] This hearing is now in session.<br> Under the authority vested in me by Starfleet Command I declare all charges and specifications in this matter have been dropped.<br> Jim.<br> Agreed you have the authority-- Mr.<br> Spock, our heading takes us near the Ceti Alpha star system.<br> Quite correct, Captain.<br> Planet number five there is habitable, although a bit savage, somewhat inhospitable.<br> No more than Australia's Botany Bay colony was at the beginning.<br> Those men went on to tame a continent, Mr.<br> Khan.<br> Can you tame a world? Have you ever read Milton, Captain? Yes.<br> I understand.<br> Lieutenant Marla McGivers.<br> Given a choice of court-martial or accompanying them there It will be difficult.<br> A struggle at first, even to stay alive, to find food.<br> I'll go with him, sir.<br> A superior woman.<br> I will take her.<br> And I've gotten something else I wanted-- a world to win, an empire to build.<br> This hearing is closed.<br> It's a shame for a good Scotsman to admit it, but I'm not up on Milton.<br> The statement Lucifer made when he fell into the pit.<br> \"It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.<br>\" Huh.<br> It would be interesting, Captain, to return to that world in a hundred years and to learn what crop has sprung from the seed you planted today.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock, it would indeed.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Nothing, sir.<br> All quiet.<br> Thank you.<br> Kirk out.<br> Look, Anan.<br> Yes, I see it.<br> They were warned.<br> Just as it happened Alert a security detachment.<br> They may be needed.<br> It was a vicious attack-- extremely destructive.<br> Fortunately, our defenses are firming, but our casualties are high-- very high.<br> Sir, I have been in contact with my ship, which has had this entire planet under surveillance.<br> All during this so-called attack of yours, we have been monitoring you.<br> There's been no attack, no explosions, no radiations, no disturbances whatsoever.<br> If this is some sort of game you're playing-- This is no game, Captain.<br> Half a million people have just been killed.<br> Activate the attack units, Sar.<br> Yes, Council man.<br> Launch immediate counter attack.<br> Computers, Captain.<br> They fight their war with computers totally.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Computers don't kill a half a million people.<br> Deaths have been registered.<br> Of course they have To report? To our disintegration machines.<br> You must understand, Captain, we have been at war for 500 years.<br> Under ordinary conditions, no civilization could with stand that, but we have reached a solution.<br> Then the attack by Vendikar was theoretical.<br> Oh, no.<br> Quite real.<br> An attack is mathematically launched.<br> I lost my wife in the last attack.<br> Our civilization lives.<br> The people die, but our culture goes on.<br> You mean to tell me your people just walk into a disintegration machine when they're told to? We have a high consciousness of duty, Captain.<br> There is a certain scientific logic about it.<br> I'm glad you approve.<br> I do not approve.<br> I understand.<br> Good.<br> Then you will recall I warned you not to come here.<br> You chose to ignore my warning.<br> I'm sorry, but it's happened.<br> What has happened? Once your ship was in orbit about our planet, it became a legitimate target.<br> It has been classified destroyed by a tricobalt satellite explosion.<br> All persons aboard your ship have 24 hours to report to our disintegration machines.<br> In order to ensure their cooperation, I have ordered you, Captain, and your party held in custody until they surrender.<br> If possible, we shall spare your ship, Captain, but its passengers and crew are already dead.<br> Captain 's Log delayed.<br> The Enterprise, in orbit about Eminiar 7, has been declared a casualty of an incredible war fought by computers.<br> land my landing party, though apparently not included as casualties aboard the Enterprise, are confined on the planet's surface awaiting what? I have been sent to ask if you require anything.<br> We require a great deal.<br> I wish to speak to Anan 7.<br> He's busy coordinating casualty lists.<br> He'll have more casualty lists than he knows what to do with if he doesn't talk to me.<br> Don't you understand? Our duty-- Your duty doesn't include stepping into a disintegrator and disappearing.<br> I'm afraid mine does, Captain.<br> I have been declared a casualty.<br> I must report to a disintegrator by noon tomorrow.<br> Is that all it means to you, to report and die? My life is as dear to me as yours is to you.<br> - Then how can you stand-- - Don't you see? If I refuse to report and others refuse, then Vendikar would have no choice but to launch real weapons.<br> We would have to do the same to defend ourselves.<br> More than people would die then.<br> A whole civilization would be destroyed.<br> Surely you can see that ours is a better way.<br> No, I don't see that at all.<br> It's been our way for almost 500 years.<br> Is there anything I can bring you? Yes.<br> Anan 7.<br> I tell you, we should have heard something by now.<br> Aye, Doctor, that we should, but we haven't, and we cannot raise them.<br> You know, if there'd been trouble, they should have managed to get word back to us.<br> We can't just sit here.<br> What would you suggest? Me? I'm a doctor.<br> If I were an officer-- Would you have me open fire? Of course not.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, message coming in from the captain.<br> Scott here, Captain.<br> Good news, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> The Eminian shave agreed to the establishment of full normal diplomatic relations.<br> Mr.<br> Fox will be glad to hear about that.<br> They've extended an invitation to all personnel to come ashore.<br> They've assured me our people will have a wonderful time.<br> Uh, Captain? Yes, Mr.<br> Scott? All personnel? All personnel.<br> We'll transport up trained Eminians to assume support positions.<br> Those are my orders, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, aye, Captain.<br> We'll start forming shore parties immediately.<br> Scott out.<br> Well, now, what do you think of that? I don't know.<br> Well, I do.<br> Computer, last message received and recorded from Captain Kirk.<br> [Computer Whirs] In play.<br> Run it through analyzer.<br> Question-- Is it or is it not the captain's voice? Negative.<br> A close copy.<br> A voice duplicator? Well, they've got them, Doctor, and now they're trying to get us.<br> Are you sure you can do it, Mr.<br> Spock? Limited telepathic abilities are inherent in Vulcanians, Captain.<br> It may work.<br> It may not.<br> Do your best.<br> - Thank you.<br> - My pleasure.<br> What do we do now? We get our communicators back and try and contact the ship.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we'll need more weapons.<br> I understand.<br> We'll try to take it easy, but if we're forced to kill An entrance, Captain, but no exit.<br> They go in, but they do not come out.<br> A disintegration machine.<br> So I would assume.<br> - Mea! - Oh! - What do you think you're doing? - I'm--I'm going-- - You're not going in there.<br> - Well, I must.<br> Please--don't worry about me.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, that guard.<br> I'll cover you.<br> Sir, there's a multilegged creature crawling on your shoulder.<br> All right, you people, clear out of the way.<br> What are you doing? Throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery.<br> You can't do this.<br> I've done it.<br> Come on.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> The Federation prisoners have attacked their guard and escaped.<br> They are armed.<br> Disintegration station number 12 destroyed, Council man, apparently by disruptor fire.<br> All security personnel, Federation prisoners have escaped.<br> They are to be found.<br> They are armed.<br> If they resist, do what is necessary.<br> Planetary disruptor banks, calculate orbit of star cruiser now circling.<br> Stand by to fire full power.<br> Councilman, planetary disruptor banks locked onto target.<br> Standing by.<br> In 10 seconds, open fire.<br> Destroy the star cruiser.<br> Those are the orders of the council.<br> Ship 's Log.<br> Star date 3193.<br>0-- Chief Engineer Scott recording.<br> The captain and first officer are overdue and missing on the surface of Eminiar 7.<br> I have taken standard precautionary measures while we continue our attempts to locate them.<br> All stations reporting.<br> Deflector screens rigged at full power.<br> Phaser crews ready.<br> Sensors reading 0.<br> Correction.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> DePaul? Sensor readings just shot off the scale.<br> Well, now they're taking pot shots at us.<br> Holding, Mr.<br> DePaul? Screens firm, sir.<br> Extremely powerful sonic vibrations.<br> Decibels-- 18 to the 12th power.<br> If those screens weren't up, we'd be totally disrupted by now.<br> I guess that answers our questions, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> They're not very friendly, are they? Aye.<br> But what about our captain and the landing party down there some where? We get them out.<br> If they're alive and if we can find them.<br> That's a big planet.<br> Not too big for the Enterprise to handle.<br> We can't fire full phasers with our screens up.<br> We can't lower our screens with their disruptors on us.<br> I could treat them to a few dozen photon torpedoes.<br> You'll do no such thing.<br> We're under attack.<br> They're trying to knock us down.<br> You have taken defensive measures.<br> Of course, but-- There are no buts.<br> Obviously it's a misunderstanding.<br> One of my jobs is to clear up misunderstandings.<br> They're holding our captain.<br> We have no proof of that.<br> I'm responsible for the safety of this ship.<br> I'm responsible for the success of this mission, and that's more important.<br> Is that clear? We came here to establish diplomatic relations.<br> But they're the ones looking for a fight.<br> This is a diplomatic matter.<br> If you check your regulations, you'll find that my orders get priority.<br> I'll try to make contact with the planetary officials.<br> Lieutenant, open up a channel and keep it open.<br> Tell them to expect a priority-1 message from me.<br> There will be no punitive measures, gentlemen.<br> Those are my orders.<br> Diplomats.<br> The best diplomat I know is a fully activated phaser bank.<br> Why did we come back here, Captain? The last place they'll look is where we escaped from.<br> Cover the door.<br> Captain, let me go.<br> My time's almost up.<br> Are you that anxious to die? You don't understand.<br> How did that raid work out? We captured four of their weapons, two complete outfits of male clothing, and, most important of all, one of their communication devices.<br> Will it reach the ship? Its range is restricted in comparison with ours.<br> I can alter its components, but it will take time.<br> Work on it.<br> We've got to contact the ship.<br> Mea, give me a complete layout of this complex.<br> - How do I get to the war room? - No! Listen to me.<br> I'm trying to help you, to save your life and millions like you.<br> If you help me, maybe I can do it.<br> If you don't, you'll die, we'll die, and the killing will go on-- Or are you that fond of the war? What are you going to do? We're going to try and stop the killing.<br> We're trying to help.<br> Believe me.<br> I believe you, but-- Tell me what I want to know.<br> Please.<br> Time is running out.<br> We have been unable to destroy the Earth ship, one of our disintegration chambers has been eliminated, and we have already fallen far behind in our quota.<br> This is a grave crisis, and I am at a loss to know how to proceed.<br> The central channel, Anan.<br> The Earth ambassador's calling with an urgent message.<br> What is the great immorality, open honesty or a deception which may save our lives? Put me through to the Earth ambassador.<br> A channel is open, Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> You will be speaking to Anan 7, head of the High Council of the Eminian Union.<br> [Beep] Mr.<br> Anan, this is Robert Fox, special ambassador for the United Federation of Planets.<br> A great honor, Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> We have approached you openly, with the intent of establishing formal and friendly relations between our peoples, but now, for some reason, you have attacked us, and apparently you're holding several special representatives of our Federation.<br> A mistake, Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> We are at war.<br> An error in our sensors indicated that your ship was about to attack us.<br> I'm giving orders that our attack be stopped.<br> Now, as to your representatives, you have my sacred word as an Eminian that they are alive and well.<br> Thank you.<br> I thought perhaps it was all a mistake.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, disruptor beams are no longer hitting us.<br> Maintain status, Mr.<br> DePaul.<br> We are most anxious to establish relations with you, Mr.<br> Fox.<br> We will make arrangements to receive you.<br> The minute their screens are down, open fire.<br> Yes, Councilman.<br> I apologize deeply for the misunderstanding.<br> These are trying times for us, you understand.<br> I understand.<br> Mr.<br> Anan, I presume that you have our ship's captain on hand when I beam down.<br> He will be there, sir.<br> I give you my word.<br> I'm sure that from now on, your planet and our Federation will attain the deepest friendship.<br> I look forward to seeing you.<br> Diplomacy, gentlemen, should be a job left to diplomats.<br> You will, of course, immediately resume a peaceful status.<br> No, sir, I will not.<br> What did you say? I'll not lower the screens, not until the captain tells me to.<br> You are taking orders from me.<br> You will lower the screens as a sign of good faith.<br> My authority.<br> I know about your authority, but the screens stay up.<br> Mr.<br> Fox, they faked a message from the captain, they've launched an attack against our ship.<br> You want us to trust them openly? I want you to obey my lawful orders.<br> No, sir.<br> I won't lower the screens.<br> Your refusal to comply with my orders has endangered the entire success of this mission.<br> I can have you sent to a penal colony.<br> You can, sir, but I won't lower the screens.<br> Your name will figure prominently in my report to the Federation Central.<br> Well, Scotty, now you've done it.<br> Aye.<br> The haggis is in the fire for sure, but I'll not lower my defenses on the word of that mealy mouthed gentleman down below, not until I know what happened to the captain.<br> Won't you join me in a drink, Captain? You'll find our trova most interesting.<br> I didn't come to drink.<br> I assume that is what you used to destroy disintegration chamber 12.<br> An efficient weapon.<br> I'm not afraid of using it.<br> My first impression was correct.<br> You are a barbarian.<br> I am? Don't sound so incredulous, Captain.<br> Of course you are.<br> We all are.<br> A killer first, a builder second.<br> A hunter, a warrior, and--let's be honest-- a murderer.<br> That is our joint her it age, is it not? We're less cold-blooded about it than you are.<br> What do you want, Captain? I want to contact my ship.<br> Where are my communicators? In a safe place.<br> You take a lot of chances, Councilman.<br> You're worried about your ship, Captain.<br> I'm trying to save a world.<br> If I were you, I'd think about saving my life.<br> Won't you have a drink, Captain? And then we can discuss our differences.<br> I'm not interested in discussing our differences.<br> You don't seem to realize the risk youÂre taking.<br> We don't make war with computers and herd the casualties into suicide stations.<br> We make the real thing, Councilman.<br> I could destroy this planet.<br> Why do you think I don't let you talk to your ship ? I don't need the ship for that.<br> You mean, all by yourself with a disruptor, you can destroy this planet? That's exactly what I mean.<br> I had no idea you were soformidable.<br> You think I'm joking? Where are the communicators? If I told you, Captain, would you walk right out and get them? Something like that.<br> Very well, Captain.<br> They're in the war room.<br> Go left, down the corridor, left again.<br> They are unguarded.<br> Is he alive? Pity.<br> Man like that would have preferred to die fighting.<br> Take him to the council room.<br> Ambassador Fox? I am Robert Fox.<br> Have I the honor of addressing Anan 7? Welcome to Eminiar, Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> Uh, Mr.<br> Ambassador, I am truly sorry for what must happen.<br> I beg your pardon? You and your party have been declared war casualties.<br> You will be taken to one of our casualty stations so that your deaths may be recorded.<br> You mean we are to be killed? That is correct, Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> I regret it very much, but there is nothing I can do about it.<br> [Beeping] Spock to Enterprise, come in.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, it's Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Scotty here, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Go ahead.<br> Is the ship all right? We're all right now.<br> How about the captain and you? The captain is overdue.<br> We've suffered no casualties among us.<br> This is important.<br> Under no circumstances shall any one beam down from the Enterprise.<br> They'd be killed the moment they arrived.<br> That ties it.<br> Fox went down a couple minutes ago.<br> The ambassador.<br> I knew it had a rotten ring to it.<br> Orbit out to maximum phaser range and stand by for further orders.<br> Spock out.<br> What are you going to do, Mr.<br> Spock? Find the ambassador and the captain.<br> Yeoman Tamula, you stay here and prevent this young lady from immolating herself.<br> Knock her down if necessary.<br> This is a killing situation.<br> Do what you must to protect yourself.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What are you doing? I'm a representative of the United Federation of Planets! A special representative! Get in line.<br> Spock! Please, Mr.<br> Fox.<br> Move quickly away from the chamber or you may be injured.<br> [Beeping] What are you doing, Mr.<br> Spock? Practicing a peculiar variety of diplomacy, sir.<br> I'll take you to a safe place, then I must find the captain.<br> They have him.<br> The guards told us.<br> They took him to the council room under heavy guard.<br> By now, Mr.<br> Ambassador, I'm sure you realize that normal diplomatic procedures are ineffective here.<br> I've never been a soldier, Mr.<br> Spock, but I learn very quickly.<br> Very well.<br> We need all the help we can get.<br> Captain, surely you can see the position we are in.<br> If your people do not report to our disintegration chambers, it is a violation of an agreement that dates back 500 years.<br> My people are not responsible for your agreements.<br> You will be responsible for an escalation that will destroy everything.<br> Millions of people horribly killed, complete destruction of our culture here and the culture on Vendikar, disaster, disease, starvation, horrible, lingering death, pain and anguish! That seems to frighten you.<br> It would frighten any sane man.<br> Yes.<br> You're quite right.<br> Don't you understand, Captain? We have done away with all that.<br> Now you are threatening to bring it down on us again.<br> Are those 500 people of yours more important than the hundreds of millions of innocent people on Eminiar and Vendikar? What kind of monster are you? I'm a barbarian.<br> You said it yourself.<br> I had hoped I'd spoken only figuratively.<br> Oh, no.<br> You were quite accurate.<br> I plan to prove it to you.<br> Open a channel to the Enterprise.<br> You give me no choice, Captain.<br> We are not bandits, but you force us to act as bandits.<br> This is the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> Scotty, general order 24 in 2 hours! In 2 hours! Enterprise this is Anan 7, first councilman of the High Council of Eminiar.<br> We hold your captain, his party, your ambassador and his party prisoners.<br> Unless you immediately start transportation of all personnel aboard your ship to the surface, the hostages will be killed.<br> You have 30 minutes.<br> I mean it, Captain.<br> All that it means is that I won't be around for the destruction.<br> You heard me give general order 24.<br> In two hours, the Enterprise will destroy Eminiar 7.<br> Planetary Defense System, open fire on the Enterprise! I'm sorry, Councilman.<br> The target has moved out of range.<br> You wouldn't do this.<br> Hundreds of millions of people.<br> I didn't start it, Councilman but I'm liable to finish it.<br> Councilman, received a message from Vendikar.<br> Our time is nearly up.<br> Our quota is short by several thousand.<br> They accuse us of reneging on the treaty.<br> You see? It's started.<br> You're wrong.<br> It hasn't begun.<br> Councilman, disintegrator station 11 has been destroyed.<br> Guard positions in tunnels 8 and 10 fail to answer.<br> Earth party reported seen in corridor 4-A.<br> You have less than What I want has nothing to do with it.<br> Escalation is automatic.<br> You can stop it! Stop it? I'm counting on it.<br> Open a channel, Lieutenant.<br> [Beep] This is the commander of the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> All cities and installations on Eminiar 7 have been located, identified, and fed into our fire control system.<br> In 1 hour and 45 minutes, the entire inhabited surface of your planet will be destroyed.<br> You have that long to surrender your hostages.<br> What can I do? Somebody please tell me.<br> Hold it! Over there.<br> You, over there.<br> Move, move, move.<br> Now we'll talk.<br> I had assumed you needed help.<br> I see I'm in error.<br> No.<br> I need the help.<br> In there, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in, Scotty.<br> Captain, are you all right? Everything's secure here.<br> Maintain position.<br> If everything goes to plan, you can beam us up in 10 minutes.<br> If you don't hear from us, carry out general order 24 on schedule.<br> Aye, aye, Captain.<br> Is there anything else we can do? Cross your fingers.<br> Kirk out.<br> Death destruction, disease, horror that's what war is all about, Anan.<br> That's what makes it a thing to be avoided.<br> You've made it neat and painless.<br> So neat and painless, you've had no reason to stop it.<br> And you've had it for 500 years.<br> Since it's the only way I can save my crew and my ship, I'm going to end it for you one way or another.<br> Mr.<br> Ambassador.<br> Yes, Captain.<br> Take these people out into the corridor and hold them there.<br> Gentlemen, if you please.<br> You come with me.<br> Mr.<br> Osborne.<br> Our communicators, weapons.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> These are the attack computers, Captain.<br> That one's defense, that one computes the casualties.<br> They're tied in with a subspace transmission unit, which keeps them in constant contact with their Vendikan counterparts.<br> Yes, go on.<br> At the moment contact is broken, it abrogates the agreement between the two warring parties.<br> What are you going to do? This one's the key.<br> The circuit is now locked.<br> Destroy this one, and they'll all go.<br> Good.<br> Get him out.<br> No.<br> Wait a minute! Please, please! Let's go.<br> Against the walls! You realize what you have done? Yes, I do.<br> I've given you back the horrors of war.<br> The Vendikans now assume that you've broken your agreement and you're preparing to wage real war with real weapons.<br> They'll do the same, only the next attack they launch will do more than count up numbers in a computer.<br> They'll destroy cities, devastate your planet.<br> You'll want to retaliate.<br> If I were you, I'd start making bombs.<br> Yes, Councilman, you have a real war on your hands.<br> You can either wage it with real weapons, or you might consider an alternative-- Put an end to it.<br> Make peace.<br> There can be no peace.<br> Don't you see? We've admitted it to ourselves.<br> We're a killer species.<br> It's instinctive.<br> It's the same with you.<br> Your general order 24.<br> All right.<br> It's instinctive.<br> The instinct can be fought.<br> We're human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands, but we can stop it.<br> We can admit that we're killers, but we won't kill today.<br> That's all it takes-- knowing that we won't kill today.<br> Contact Vendikar.<br> I think you'll find that they're just as terrified, appalled, horrified as you are, that they'll do anything to avoid the alternative-- peace or utter destruction.<br> It's up to you.<br> As a third party interested only in peace and the establishment of normal relations, I should be glad to offer my services as negotiator between you and Vendikar.<br> I've had some small experiences in such matters.<br> There may be a chance.<br> We have a direct channel with Vendikar's High Council.<br> It hasn't been used in centuries.<br> Then it's long overdue.<br> Shall we go? There's a chance it may work, Captain.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Scotty? Scott here, Captain.<br> Cancel implementation of general order 24.<br> Alert transporter room.<br> We're ready to beam up.<br> Lay in a course for Argana 2, Navigator.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? Space detail set, Captain.<br> Message from Eminiar 7, Captain.<br> Ambassador Fox reports negotiations underway with Vendikar.<br> Outlook hopeful.<br> Good.<br> Captain you took a big chance.<br> Did I, Mr.<br> Spock? They have been killing It went on for 500 years.<br> An actual attack wouldn't have killed any more people, but it would have ended their ability to make war.<br> The fighting would have been over permanently.<br> But you didn't know it would work.<br> No.<br> It was a calculated risk.<br> Still, the Eminians keep a very orderly society, and actual war is a very messy business, a very, very messy business.<br> I had a feeling that they would do anything to avoid it, even talk peace.<br> Feeling is not much to go on.<br> Sometimes a feeling, Mr.<br> Spock, is all we humans have to go on.<br> Captain you almost make me believe in luck.<br> Why, Mr.<br> Spock, you almost make me believe in miracles.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I am saying they knew there was a risk.<br> Can we afford to send people to the planet's surface?

I've examined nine men so far varying in ages from 23 to 59.<br> They're all in perfect condition.<br> Text book responses.<br> Heart/lungs, excellent.<br> Coordination, excellent.<br> Reflexes, excellent.<br> Many more of them, and I can throw away my shingle.<br> [Communicator Beeps] Kirk here.<br> Spock here, Captain.<br> There seems to be a total absence of life on the planet with the exception of the colonists and various types of flora.<br> Sulu had the same observation.<br> Any explanations? Not at the moment, sir.<br> I am conducting various tests, but results are inconclusive.<br> Very well.<br> Continue investigations.<br> Kirk out.<br> Hmm.<br> No animals? That's peculiar.<br> Especially in view of the fact that the records indicate that they had some for breeding and food purposes.<br> Apparently, none of them survived.<br> I'd like to see their medical records.<br> I thought you might.<br> Oh, Captain, I've been looking for you.<br> You haven't seen our fields and crops.<br> I'd like to show you what we've accomplished here.<br> I'll have to bow out.<br> I have to continue with these medical examinations.<br> However, if I find everyone else's health to be as perfect as yours, I He promised to throw away his shingle.<br> You'll find no weaklings here.<br> Captain.<br> This is the reason, Captain.<br> This soil will grow anything we plant in it.<br> It's a perfect world.<br> We have a moderate climate, moderate rains all year round.<br> It gives us all we need.<br> It is perfect.<br> Pardon me, Captain.<br> Biology report ready, sir.<br> I have work to attend to myself, Captain.<br> Go ahead, Lieutenant.<br> I heard Sandoval saying they could grow anything here.<br> That's true.<br> They've got a variety of crops in.<br> Grains, potatoes, beans.<br> Make your point.<br> Well, for an agricultural colony, they have actually very little acreage planted.<br> There's enough to sustain the colony, but very little more.<br> It's like a jigsaw puzzle all one color.<br> No key to where the pieces fit in.<br> Why? [Communicator Beeps] Kirk here.<br> This is McCoy, Jim.<br> I think you better get back here.<br> Trouble? No, but you should see this for yourself.<br> On my way.<br> Sandoval's medical record four years ago.<br> He registered scar tissue on his lungs from lobar pneumonia suffered when he was a child.<br> No major operations, but there was an appendectomy.<br> Received all required inoculations, et cetera.<br> What's so strange about that? Nothing.<br> But I examined that man no more than two hours ago.<br> Know what his readings were? Perfect, perfect, and perfect.<br> Just like everyone else I've examined here.<br> Instrument malfunction? I thought of that and tested it on myself.<br> It accurately recorded my lack of tonsils and those two broken ribs I had once.<br> It did not record the scar tissue on Sandoval's lungs, but it did record a healthy appendix where one was supposedly removed.<br> [Tricorder Hums] Nothing.<br> Not even insects.<br> Yet your plants grow, and you've survived exposure to berthold rays.<br> That can be explained.<br> Please do.<br> Later.<br> I have never understood the female capacity to avoid a direct answer to any question.<br> And I never understood you.<br> Until now.<br> There was always a place in here where no one could come.<br> There was only the face you allow people to see.<br> Only one side you'd allow them to know.<br> I would like to know how your people have managed to survive here.<br> I missed you.<br> Logically, you should all be dead.<br> If I tell you how we survive, will you try to understand how we feel about our life here? About each other? Emotions are alien to me.<br> I'm a scientist.<br> Someone else might believe that-- your shipmates, your captain-- but not me.<br> Come.<br> Mr.<br> Sandoval, I've received orders from Starfleet Command to evacuate all personnel from this colony.<br> Naturally, you'll inform your people to begin preparations.<br> We will have accommodations for you aboard the Enterprise.<br> No.<br> Uh, it's not an arbitrary decision on my part.<br> I have my orders.<br> Captain, it's entirely unnecessary.<br> We're in no danger here.<br> We've explained the berthold rays to you and their effect.<br> Can't you understand? Doctor, how can I make you understand? Your own instruments have shown we're all in perfect health.<br> We've had no deaths here.<br> What about your animals? We're vegetarians.<br> That doesn't answer my question, sir.<br> Why did all your animals die? Captain, you stress very unimportant matters.<br> We will not leave.<br> It's not much further.<br> You've not yet explained the nature of this thing.<br> Its basic properties and elements are not important.<br> What is important is it gives life, peace, love.<br> What you're describing was once known in the vernacular as a happiness pill.<br> And you, as a scientist, should know that that's not possible.<br> Come.<br> I was one of the first to find them.<br> The spores.<br> Spores? No It shouldn't hurt.<br> No, I can't.<br> Please, don't! Not like this, it didn't hurt us.<br> I am not like you.<br> Now now you belong to all of us and we to you.<br> There's no need to hide your inner face any longer.<br> We understand.<br> I love you.<br> I can love you.<br> Captain 's Log.<br> : supplemental.<br> We have been ordered by Starfleet Command to evacuate the colony on Omicron 3.<br> However, the colony leader, Elias Sandoval, has refused all cooperation and will not listen to any arguments.<br> Sandoval.<br> Your arguments are very valid, but they don't apply to us.<br> You're being unreasonable.<br> Nevertheless, excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> My orders are to remove all the colonists.<br> That's exactly what I intend to do with or without your help.<br> Without, I should think.<br> Would you like to use a butterfly net on him? Captain! We've checked out everything.<br> It all seems normal except for the absence of any animals.<br> We have orders to evacuate all colonists to Star base 27.<br> I want landing parties to coordinate the colonists and prepare them for transport up to the ship.<br> We'll need extra accommodations aboard.<br> Where's Mr.<br> Spock and Mr.<br> DeSalle? We haven't seen them since we began our check.<br> DeSalle was going to examine some native plants.<br> Did Spock call in at all? No, he didn't.<br> Spock? See to the landing parties, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Spock? [Beep Beep] That one looks like a dragon.<br> You see the tail and the dorsal spines? I've never seen a dragon.<br> - [Beep Beep] - I have.<br> - [Beep Beep] - On Berengaria 7.<br> But I've never stopped to look at clouds before.<br> [Beep Beep Beep] Or rainbows.<br> I can tell you exactly why one appears in the sky, but considering its beauty has always been out of the question.<br> Not here.<br> [Beep Beep] [Beep Beep] [Beep Beep] Spock! Yes.<br> What did you want? Spock, is that you? Yes, Captain.<br> What did you want? Where are you? I don't believe I want to tell you.<br> I don't know what you think you're doing, but this is an order.<br> Report back to the settlement in 10 minutes.<br> We're evacuating all colonists to Star base 27.<br> No, I don't think so.<br> You don't think so, what? I don't think so, sir.<br> Spock report to me immediately.<br> Spock? Acknowledge.<br> Spock.<br> The frequency is open, but he doesn't answer.<br> That didn't sound at all like Spock, Jim.<br> No, it -- I thought you said you might like him if he mellowed a little.<br> I didn't say that! Not exactly.<br> He might be in trouble.<br> Yes, take over the landing party detail.<br> Start getting those colonists aboard.<br> How will you find Spock? The frequency is open.<br> It'll act as a homing device.<br> Contact DeSalle.<br> Have him meet you here.<br> Have the landing party work in teams of two.<br> I don't want anybody left alone here.<br> [Communicator Whines] Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Spock.<br> Ahem! Mr.<br> Spock? What are you doing with those things, DeSalle? I want you to take a close look at these, Doc.<br> They're very interesting.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Are you out of your mind? You were told to report to me at once.<br> I didn't want to, Jim.<br> You -- Yes, I can see that.<br> Miss Kalomi, you'll have to come back to the settlement and prepare to transport up to the ship.<br> There'll be no evacuation, Jim.<br> But perhaps we should go get you straightened out.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, Mr.<br> Spock is under arrest, and he's in your custody until we get back to the Enterprise.<br> Very well.<br> Come with me.<br> What's Mr.<br> Sulu understands, don't you, Mr.<br> Sulu? Yes.<br> I see now.<br> Of course we can't remove the colony.<br> It'd be wrong.<br> I don't know what these plants are or how they work, but you're all going back to the settlement with me, and those colonists are going aboard the ship.<br> I can see the captain's going to be difficult.<br> Ready to beam up.<br> Hiya, Jimmy boy! Hey, I've taken care of everything.<br> All y'all gotta do is relax.<br> Doctor's orders! How many of those did you beam up? Oh, nigh onto 100 by now.<br> Hey, Doc, I'm ready to energize.<br> Everything okay with those plants? This is the captain.<br> Beam me up.<br> Well, sure, if you want.<br> I most certainly do.<br> Energize.<br> Lieutenant put me through to Admiral Komak at Starfleet.<br> Oh, I'm sorry, Captain.<br> I can't do that.<br> What? Follow standard procedure.<br> That's an order.<br> Oh, I know it is, Captain.<br> But, you see, all communications are out.<br> Out? I short-circuited them, except ship-to-surface.<br> We'll need that for a while.<br> It's really for the best, Captain.<br> Go back to your stations.<br> Get back to your stations.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> We're all transporting down to join the colony.<br> I said get back to your station.<br> No, sir.<br> This is mutiny, mister.<br> Yes, sir.<br> It is.<br> Captain 's Log.<br> : Star date 3417.<br>5.<br> The pod plants have spread spores throughout the ship carried by the ventilation system.<br> Under their influence, my crew is deserting to join the Omicron colony, and I can't stop them.<br> I don't know why I have not been infected, nor can I get Dr.<br> McCoy to explain the physical, psychological aspects of the infection.<br> I'm not interested in any physical, psychological aspects, Jim-boy.<br> We all perfectly healthy down here.<br> I've heard that word a lot lately.<br> Perfect.<br> Everything's perfect.<br> Yeah.<br> That's right.<br> ThatÂs just what it is.<br> I'll bet you've even grown your tonsils back.<br> Sho'nuf.<br> Hey, Jim-boy, y'all ever have a real cold Georgia-style mint julep, huh? Look, Bones, I need your help.<br> Can you run tests, blood samples, anything to give us a lead on what these things are, how to counteract them? Who wants to counteract paradise, Jim-boy? McCoy out.<br> Bones.<br> Bones.<br> Almost the entire ship's complement has beamed down.<br> I'm very pleased.<br> The entire landing operation is proceeding quite well.<br> Where's McCoy? He went off to create something called a mint julep.<br> That's a drink, Jim.<br> Captain, why don't you join us? In your own private paradise.<br> The spores have made it that.<br> Where did they originate? That's impossible to say.<br> They drifted through space until they finally landed here.<br> You see, they actually thrive on berthold rays.<br> The plants act as a repository for thousands of microscopic spores until they find a human body to inhabit.<br> In return, they give you complete health and peace of mind.<br> That's paradise? We have no need or want, Captain.<br> It's a true Eden, Jim.<br> There is belonging and love.<br> No wants.<br> No needs.<br> We weren't meant for that.<br> None of us.<br> Man stagnates if he has no ambition, no desire to be more than he is.<br> We have what we need.<br> Except a challenge.<br> You don't understand, Jim, but you'll come around sooner or later.<br> Join us.<br> Please.<br> I'm going back to the ship.<br> Engineering? Scotty? Biochemistry lab? Security? Is there anyone on board? This is the captain.<br> Captain's Log : Star date 3417.<br>7.<br> Except for myself, all crew personnel have transported to the surface of the planet.<br> Mutinied.<br> Lieutenant Uhura has effectively sabotaged the communications station.<br> I can only contact the surface of the planet.<br> The ship can be maintained in orbit for several months, but even with automatic controls, I cannot pilot her alone.<br> In effect, I am marooned here.<br> I'm beginning to realize Just how big this ship really is, how quiet.<br> I don't know how to get my crew back, how to counteract the effect of the spores.<br> I don't know what I can offer against paradise.<br> Enterprise to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Yes, Jim.<br> What is it now? I've joined you.<br> I understand now.<br> Wonderful, Jim.<br> When will you beam down? There's some things I want to pack.<br> Good.<br> Leila and I will meet you at the beam-down point.<br> Kirk out.<br> No.<br> No! I can't leave! Emotions.<br> Violent emotions.<br> Needs.<br> Anger.<br> Captain's Log : supplemental.<br> I think I've discovered the answer but to carry out my plan entails considerable risk.<br> Mr.<br> Spock is much stronger than the ordinary human being.<br> Aroused, his great physical strength could kill.<br> But it's a risk I'll have to take.<br> Enterprise to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Spock here.<br> It's Jim.<br> What's keeping you? We've been waiting.<br> I've been packing, and I realize there's some equipment here that we should have down at the settlement.<br> You know we can't come back on board once the last of us has left.<br> You want me to beam up a party? No.<br> I think you and I can handle it.<br> Why don't you beam up now? Just a moment.<br> It won't take long.<br> Do you mind? I'll wait.<br> Ready to beam up, Jim.<br> Energizing.<br> All right, you mutinous, disloyal, computerized, half-breed, we'll see about you deserting my ship.<br> The term half-breed is somewhat applicable, but computerized is inaccurate.<br> A machine can be computerized, not a man.<br> What makes you think you're a man? You're an overgrown jackrabbit, an elf with a hyperactive thyroid.<br> Jim, I don't understand-- Of course you don't understand.<br> You don't have the brains to understand.<br> All you have is printed circuits.<br> Captain, if you'll excuse me -- What can you expect from a simpering, devil-eared freak whose father was a computer and his mother an encyclopedia? My mother was a teacher.<br> My father, an ambassador.<br> Your father was a computer like his son.<br> An ambassador from a planet of traitors.<br> A Vulcan never lived who had an ounce of integrity.<br> Captain, please don't -- You're a traitor from a race of traitors.<br> Disloyal to the core, rotten like the rest of your subhuman race, and you've got the gall to make love to that girl.<br> That's enough.<br> Does she know what she's getting, Spock? A carcass full of memory banks who should be squatting in a mushroom instead of passing himself off as a man? You belong in a circus, Spock, not a starship right next to the dog-faced boy.<br> Had enough? I didn't realize what it took to get under that thick hide of yours.<br> I don't know what you're so mad about.<br> It isn't every first officer who gets to belt his captain several times.<br> You did that to me deliberately.<br> Believe me, Mr.<br> Spock, it was painful in more ways than one.<br> The spores.<br> They're gone.<br> I don't belong anymore.<br> You said they were benevolent and peaceful.<br> Violent emotions overwhelm them, destroy them.<br> I had to make you angry enough to shake off their influence.<br> That's the answer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That may be correct, Captain, but trying to initiate a brawl with over 500 crewmen and colonists is hardly logical.<br> I had something else in mind.<br> Can you put together a subsonic transmitter-- something we can hook into the communications station and broadcast over the communicator? It can be done.<br> Good.<br> Let's get to work.<br> Captain.<br> Striking a fellow officer is a court-martial offense.<br> If we're both in the brig, who's going to build the subsonic transmitter? That is quite logical, Captain.<br> It's a little early to be counting stars, Miss Leila.<br> I'm waiting for Mr.<br> Spock and the captain to transport down.<br> They had some equipment to be moved.<br> But it's been so long.<br> I wish he'd come back.<br> Well, now, I think I can fix that for you.<br> Enterprise? [Beep Beep] Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> This is Leila.<br> I borrowed the doctor's communicator.<br> I was worried something might have happened to you.<br> You are all right, arenÂt you? Yes.<br> Yes.<br> I'mI'm quite well.<br> Can I come aboard? I've never seen a starship before, and I want to talk to you.<br> Are you still at the beam-down point, and is the doctor there? Yes to both questions.<br> Give your communicator back to Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> You won't need it to beam up.<br> It'll take a few moments.<br> Just wait there.<br> Out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock Miss Kalomi is strictly your concern, but should you talk to her while she's still under the influence of the spore? I'll be back shortly, Captain.<br> You're no longer with us, are you? I felt something was wrong.<br> It was necessary.<br> Come back to the planet with me.<br> You can belong again.<br> Oh, come back with me, please.<br> I can't.<br> I love you.<br> I said that six years ago, and I can't seem to stop repeating myself.<br> On Earth, you couldn't give anything of yourself.<br> You couldn't even put your arms around me.<br> We couldn't have anything together there.<br> We couldn't have anything together anyplace else.<br> We're happy here.<br> I can't lose you now, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I can't.<br> I have a responsibility to this ship to that man on the bridge.<br> I am what I am, Leila and if there are self-made purgatories, then we all have to live in them.<br> Mine can be no worse than someone else's.<br> I have lost you, haven't I? Not only you, I've lost all of it.<br> The spores I've lost them, too.<br> The captain discovered that strong emotions and needs destroy the spore influence.<br> And this is for my good? Do you mind if I say I still love you? You never told me if you had another name, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You couldn't pronounce it.<br> They'll not hear this, of course.<br> It'll be more a sensation of feeling it.<br> Like somebody had put itching powder on their skin.<br> Precisely.<br> It should begin to work on their nerves in a few minutes.<br> [High-pitched Hum] Sorry, DeSalle.<br> What do you think you're doing? I said I was sorry.<br> More like you're clumsy.<br> If you hadn't gotten in my way Ooh! Come on.<br> Break it up.<br> Break it up.<br> Well, Doctor, I've been thinking about what sort of work I could assign you to.<br> What do you mean what sort of work? I'm a doctor.<br> Not anymore, of course.<br> We don't need you not as a doctor.<br> Oh, no? Would you like to see how fast I can put you in a hospital? I am the leader of this colony.<br> I'll assign you whatever work I think suitable.<br> Just a minute.<br> You'd better make me a mechanic.<br> Then I can treat little tin gods like you.<br> Sorry, Sandoval.<br> I don't know what made me do that.<br> We've done nothing here.<br> No accomplishments, no progress.<br> Three years wasted.<br> We wanted to make this planet a garden.<br> You can't stay here.<br> You can't survive without the spores.<br> After you've cleared at the star base, you could be relocated.<br> It depends upon what you want.<br> I think I'd I think we'd like to get some work done.<br> The work we started out to do.<br> Enterprise.<br> Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> This is McCoy.<br> Sandoval would like to talk to the captain.<br> Just a moment.<br> They're all beginning to call in, Captain.<br> Rather contritely, I should say.<br> Sandoval wishes to speak to you.<br> Put him on the speaker.<br> Kirk here.<br> Oh, Captain, as I understood it, you were to transport us to Star base 27.<br> We'll give you every cooperation.<br> Start making preparations, Mr.<br> Sandoval.<br> We'll begin transporting your people aboard as soon as more of our crew checks in.<br> Well, Jim, I've just examined the last of the colonists, and they're all in absolutely perfect, perfect health.<br> A fringe benefit left over by the spores.<br> Good.<br> Well, that's the second time man's been thrown out of paradise.<br> No, no.<br> This time we walked out on our own.<br> Maybe we weren't meant for paradise.<br> Maybe we were meant to fight our way through -- struggle, claw our way up, scratch for every inch of the way.<br> Maybe we can't stroll to the music of the lute.<br> We must march to the sound of drums.<br> Poetry, Captain.<br> Non regulation.<br> We haven't heard much from you about Omicron Ceti 3, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I have little to say about it, Captain, except that for the first time in my life I was happy.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

When did it start? About three months ago, we opened up a new level.<br> Sensors gave us an unusually rich pergium reading.<br> Not only pergium, whatever you want.<br> Uranium, serium, platinum.<br> The whole planet's like that.<br> It's a treasure house.<br> We're aware of that.<br> If mining conditions weren't so difficult, Janus 6 could supply the mineral needs of a thousand planets.<br> But what happened? First, the automatic machinery, piece by piece, started to almost disintegrate.<br> Metal began dissolving away.<br> There was no reason for it, and our chemists were unable to analyze the corrosive agent.<br> I'm sure there is an answer.<br> It simply has not yet been discovered.<br> Yes, it has.<br> I don't know what this butchering monster is, but I know what it's doing.<br> Our maintenance engineer sent down to the drifts to repair the corroded machinery.<br> We found him seared to a crisp.<br> Volcanic activity? There is none currently on this planet, Captain.<br> He's right.<br> None.<br> At first, the deaths were down deep, but they've been moving up toward our levels.<br> The last man died two days ago three levels below this.<br> Same way? Burned? I'd like to examine the body.<br> We kept it for you.<br> There isn't much left.<br> Roberts will show you.<br> It isn't pretty.<br> You post sentries? Guards? Of course.<br> Five of them have died.<br> Who else has seen this? I have.<br> This is Ed Appel, chief processing engineer.<br> Describe it.<br> I can't.<br> I only got a glimpse of it, but it's big and shaggy.<br> Ed shot it.<br> Oh.<br> You mean shot at it.<br> No.<br> I mean shot it.<br> With this.<br> Fascinating.<br> A good, clean shot.<br> Didn't even slow it down.<br> Well, I've made my report to you.<br> Production's stopped, nobody will go into the lower levels, and I don't blame them.<br> The Federation wants pergium, then you'll have to do something about it.<br> That's why we're here.<br> You're all pretty tough, aren't you? Starship, phaser banks.<br> You can't get your starship down in the tunnels.<br> No need to.<br> Mr.<br> Vanderberg, I'll need a complete subsurface chart of all the drifts, galleries, tunnels.<br> You'll get it.<br> Mr.<br> Vanderberg, what is this? It's a silicon nodule.<br> Millions of them are down there.<br> No commercial value.<br> But a geological oddity, to say the least.<br> Pure silicon? A few trace elements.<br> Look, we didn't call you here so you could collect rocks.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Vanderberg.<br> We'll need your complete cooperation.<br> You'll have it.<br> Just find that creature, whatever it is.<br> I've got a quota to meet.<br> Come on, Appel.<br> Vast number of tunnels won't make our hunting any easier.<br> Schmitter didn't burn to death, not in the usual sense, anyway.<br> Explain that.<br> Well, there are only fragments of bone and teeth left, but the plant's physician agrees with me -- a chemical corrosion Almost as if he'd been thrown into a vat of extremely corrosive acid.<br> Strong enough to eat machinery? Strong enough to eat anything you can think of.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, show me the positions of the deaths and acts of sabotage.<br> Here, here, and here.<br> If the times of these incidents are accurate, the creature would have to have moved at an incredible speed.<br> Mm-hmm.<br> Mr.<br> Vanderberg, how recent are these charts? They were made last year.<br> Before the appearance of whatever it is? That's right.<br> I see.<br> Mr.<br> Spock give us a report on life beneath the surface.<br> Within range of our sensors, there is no life, other than the accountable human residents of this colony beneath the surface, uh, at least, no life as we know it.<br> We can't cover all the tunnels on foot.<br> Production must be resumed.<br> We must have that pergium! If we could force another appearance of this creature When that creature appears, men die.<br> [Fiery Noise] Aaaahhhh! Too many tunnels.<br> We couldn't possibly -- Mr.<br> Spock, our sensors can pick up normal life functions at a considerable distance.<br> But what about abnormal life functions? [Siren Blares] Something's happening in the reactor room! Back to your stations.<br> Look at that.<br> I wouldn't touch it, Captain.<br> An extremely active corrosive.<br> Traces may linger.<br> Kirk! Quickly! The main circulating pump for the entire reactor-- It's gone.<br> Same indication as shown at the door, Captain -- very strong corrosive.<br> Is there a replacement for that? No.<br> None.<br> It's outdated, but it always worked fine.<br> Spock, onboard? Nothing for a device this antiquated.<br> Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go supercritical.<br> It could poison half the planet.<br> We can't shut it down.<br> It provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we seem to have been given a choice -- death by asphyxiation or death by radiation poisoning.<br> A PXK pergium reactor? No, sir.<br> We don't have any spare circulating pump for a thing like that.<br> I haven't seen a PXK in 20 years.<br> Can you rig one up? It's vital.<br> I can put together some odds and ends, but it won't hold for long.<br> How long? with luck.<br> than nothing.<br> Gather what you need and beam down here.<br> Top priority.<br> Aye, Captain.<br> I'll be right down.<br> Scott out.<br> What happens when it breaks down? Hopefully we'll find the missing part by then.<br> Small chance.<br> The alternative is to evacuate all you people to the Enterprise.<br> A dozen planets depend on you for pergium for their reactor.<br> They're already screaming.<br> Reactors closing down, life support systems -- I'm concerned with my people right here, Kirk.<br> They're being murdered.<br> Find that monster and kill it.<br> The missing pump wasn't taken by accident.<br> It was the one piece of equipment absolutely essential for the operation of the reactor.<br> Do you think the creature is trying to push the colonists off the planet? It would seem so.<br> But why now? These production facilities have been in operation for over 50 years.<br> I don't know.<br> But there is a possibility.<br> What's that? Life as we know it is universally based on some combination of carbon compounds.<br> But what if life exists based on another element? For instance Silicon? You're creating fantasies, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Not necessarily.<br> I've heard of the theoretical possibility of life based on silicon, but life of an entirely different order.<br> It's possible that our phasers might not affect it.<br> Certainly not phaser I, which is far less powerful than phaser II.<br> All right.<br> How about this -- a creature that lives deep in the planet below us, at home in solid rock.<br> It seems to me that in order to survive, it would have to have some form of natural armor plating.<br> It could explain much, especially since the colonists are armed only with phaser I.<br> But we have phaser II.<br> Which I could render more effective against silicon.<br> Silicon-based life is physiologically impossible, especially in an oxygen atmosphere.<br> It may be, Doctor, that the creature can exist for brief periods in such an atmosphere before returning to its own environment.<br> I still think you're imagining things.<br> Maybe, but at least it's something to go on.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, have Lieutenant Commander Giotto assemble the security troops and arm them with phaser II.<br> You make the proper adjustments.<br> You seem fascinated by this rock.<br> Yes, Captain.<br> You recall that Vanderberg commented there were thousands of these at a lower level-- the level which the machinery opened Just prior to the first appearance of the creature.<br> Do they tie in? I don't know.<br> Speculate.<br> I have already given Dr.<br> McCoy sufficient cause for amusement.<br> I'd prefer to cogitate the possibilities for a time.<br> A short time, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We have very little.<br> How's it going, Scotty? It's a plumber's nightmare, but it'll hold for a bit.<br> It has to hold longer.<br> Sorry.<br> That's about the best I can do.<br> [Beep Beep] Kirk here.<br> Captain, security officers have gathered in Chief Vanderberg's office.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Scotty, ride herd on it.<br> Kind words.<br> Tender, loving care.<br> Kiss it.<br> Baby it.<br> Flatter it if you have to, but keep it going.<br> I'll do what I can, sir.<br> You'll proceed from level to level, checking out every foot of opening.<br> You are searching for some sort of creature which is highly resistant to phaser fire.<br> Phasers will be set on maximum, and remember this-- I want no more deaths.<br> Except the bloody thing.<br> The creature may or may not attack on sight.<br> However, you must.<br> It is vitally important we get this installation back into production.<br> Mr.<br> Vanderberg, may I ask at which level you discovered the nodules of silicon? The 23rd.<br> Why? Commander Giotto, take your detail.<br> Go directly to the 23rd level.<br> Start your search there.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Do you have reason to suspect this creature may be on that level? It's a possibility we've discussed.<br> Keep your people on the top level together at a safe place.<br> I don't know any safe place, Captain, the way that thing comes and goes.<br> Well, gentlemen, you have your instructions.<br> Let's get at it.<br> [Sensor Wails] Mr.<br> Spock? Find something? Adjusting my tricorder to register for silicon.<br> [Sensor Continues To Wail] Interesting.<br> Traces? A life form, Captain bearing -- 111 degrees.<br> Elevation -- 4 degrees.<br> One of our people? No, sir.<br> Silicon.<br> Come on.<br> [Fiery Noise] Aaaaahhhh! He never even had a chance to fire, Captain.<br> It's only been seconds since we heard him scream.<br> The creature must still be around.<br> Captain.<br> This tunnel.<br> My readings indicate it was made within the hour, moments ago, in fact.<br> - Are you certain? - Positive.<br> This tunnel goes out of sight.<br> Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this.<br> Indeed, Captain.<br> I'm quite at a loss.<br> [Fiery Noise] Get gone.<br> Disappeared.<br> Astonishing that anything of that bulk could move so rapidly.<br> These walls are hot.<br> Indeed.<br> This tunnel was cut within the last two minutes.<br> You all right, Captain? Yes.<br> Perfectly.<br> Did you see it? Yes.<br> Where does the tunnel go? Readings indicate a maze of tunnels in that direction.<br> Did you shoot at it? Yes.<br> We took a bite out of it.<br> Not animal tissue.<br> What is it? Closest approximation I could come to would be fibrous asbestos, a mineral, Captain.<br> Then your guess was right.<br> It would seem so.<br> Silicon-based.<br> Summation.<br> We are dealing with a silicon creature of the deep rocks, capable of moving through solid rock as easily as we move through the air.<br> That explains the tunnels.<br> This creature's body secretes an extremely powerful corrosive.<br> Powerful enough to dissolve the door of the reactor chamber.<br> And it explains the murdered men.<br> It's definitely phaser resistant.<br> We had our weapons set for silicon and on full power, yet we only damaged it.<br> It still lives.<br> Meaning it's impossible to kill? No.<br> No, it might require amassed phasers.<br> Or a single phaser with much longer contact.<br> Commander Pass this on to your men -- We knew it was a killer.<br> Now it's wounded probably in pain somewhere back there.<br> There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded animal.<br> Commander Giotto.<br> Instruct your men to concentrate the search in this sector.<br> Remind them the creature is wounded.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> What is it, Spock? I've run a complete check on all life forms, radius 100 miles.<br> I've located all our men, and I've located one creature moving rapidly through native rock, bearing 201.<br> And that is all.<br> One creature in 100 miles? Exactly.<br> Captain, there are literally thousands of these tunnels in this general area alone, far too many to be cut by the one creature in an ordinary lifetime.<br> Then we're dealing with more than one creature, despite your tricorder readings, or we have a creature with an extremely long life span.<br> Or it's the last of a race of creatures which made these tunnels.<br> If it is the only survivor of a dead race, to kill it would be a crime against science.<br> Mr.<br> Spock our mission is to protect this colony, to get the pergium moving again.<br> This is not a zoological expedition.<br> Maintain a constant reading on the creature.<br> If we have to, we'll use phasers to cut our own tunnels.<br> We'll try to surround it.<br> I'm sorry, Mr.<br> Spock, but I'm afraid the creature must die.<br> I see no alternative myself, Captain.<br> It merely seems a pity.<br> The search team is gathering in the main tunnel.<br> Good.<br> So it is wounded and therefore twice as dangerous.<br> Stay in pairs.<br> If you see it, concentrate your phaser fire at what appears to be its head.<br> Concentrate it.<br> Maintain it.<br> It is definitely resistant, but it can be hurt, and thus it can be killed.<br> Gentlemen, if you'll examine your charts.<br> I last located the creature in the area marked Attit-26 moving in bearing 201.<br> This particular group will move out beyond that area in all directions to surround it, possibly capture it.<br> Your orders are shoot to kill.<br> Protect yourself at all times.<br> Commander Giotto, disperse your search parties.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Louis, Vinzi, take your men out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Capture it? I don't recall giving any such order.<br> You did not.<br> I thought, if the opportunity arose-- I will lose no more men.<br> The creature will be killed on sight.<br> That's the end of it.<br> Very well, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I want you to assist Scotty in maintaining that make shift circulating pump.<br> I--I beg your pardon, sir? You heard me.<br> It's vital that we keep that reactor in operation.<br> Your scientific knowledge -- Is not needed there, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Scott has far more knowledge of nuclear reactors than I.<br> You're aware of that.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you are second in command.<br> This hunt will be dangerous.<br> Either one of us alone is expendable.<br> Both are not.<br> Captain, there are approximately 100 of us engaged in this search against one creature.<br> The odds against you and I both being killed are 2,228.<br>7 to 1.<br> Those are pretty good odds, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> And they are of course accurate, Captain.<br> Of course.<br> Well, I hate to use the word, but logically, with those kind of odds, you might as well stay.<br> But please stay out of trouble, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is always my intention, Captain.<br> [Beep Beep] Kirk here.<br> Scotty here, Captain.<br> My brilliant improvisation Just gave up the ghost.<br> He couldn't stand the strain.<br> Can you fix it again? Negative, Captain.<br> It's gone for good.<br> Start evacuation of all colonists to the Enterprise.<br> Not all, Captain.<br> I and my key personnel are staying.<br> We'll be down to join you.<br> We haven't enough phasers for you.<br> We'll use clubs.<br> We won't run away.<br> We're staying.<br> Good.<br> Get everybody else aboard the Enterprise.<br> The fewer people down here, the longer we can hold out.<br> How much longer, Scotty? The reactor goes critical in 10 hours unless you find the mechanism.<br> We'll do our best.<br> Start feeding us constant status reports.<br> Vanderberg, you and your crew assemble at level 23, checkpoint Tiger.<br> Kirk out.<br> Team up with Enterprise personnel.<br> They're better armed than you.<br> Always keep someone in sight.<br> Vanderberg, take two men and enter that tunnel.<br> Rendezvous with Commander Giotto.<br> Appel and the rest, go through there.<br> Tie up with Lieutenant Osborne's detail.<br> Mr.<br> Spock and I will control the operation from a central point.<br> That's all.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? Captain, we are being watched.<br> Are you sure? Intuition? No, sir.<br> We're being watched.<br> [Electronic Tone] Captain.<br> Fresh readings within the hour in each of these tunnels.<br> Chart says both of these tunnels converge a few thousand yards further.<br> You go left.<br> I'll go right.<br> Should we separate? Two tunnels, two of us.<br> We separate.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Yes, Captain.<br> I've found a whole layer of these silicon nodules of yours, hundreds of them.<br> [Spock] Indeed? I find that most illuminating, Captain.<br> Be absolutely certain you do not damage any of them.<br> Explain.<br> Only a theory I have.<br> [Rumbling] Captain? [Spock] Are you all right? Jim? Jim! Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> All right.<br> Weseem to have had a cave-in.<br> I could phaser you out.<br> [Kirk] No, you better not.<br> Any disturbance might bring down the rest.<br> Besides, it isn't necessary.<br> The chart said the tunnels meet further on.<br> Very well, but I find it extremely disquieting that your roof chose that particular moment to collapse.<br> Please proceed with extreme caution.<br> I shall quicken my pace.<br> Very well, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'll meet you at the other end-- [Rumbling] [Beep Beep] Kirk here.<br> Captain, I just read some fresh signs.<br> The creature is in this area.<br> I'll take a life form reading.<br> It's not necessary, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I know exactly where the creature is.<br> Where, Captain? Kill it, Captain, quickly.<br> It's not making any threatening moves, Spock.<br> You don't dare take the chance.<br> Kill it.<br> I thought you wanted it kept alive, captured if possible.<br> Jim, your life is in danger.<br> You can't take the risk.<br> It seems to be waiting.<br> I remind you it's a proven killer.<br> I'm on my way.<br> Spock out.<br> Well what do we do, Justtalk it over? Well, you can be hurt, can't you? We just sit here? It's your move.<br> No, no! Don't shoot.<br> Come on over, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Fascinating.<br> He's made no moves against you.<br> No.<br> It seems to be waiting.<br> I tried talking to it, but no response.<br> Yes They're all through here.<br> All over the place.<br> Thousands of them.<br> Yes, I see.<br> It means something to you? Possibly the answer, Captain, but I'm not certain.<br> Captain, you are aware of the Vulcan technique of the joining of two minds.<br> You think you can get through to that thing? Possible.<br> Mr.<br> Spock I know it's a terrible personal lowering of mental barriers but if there's a chance I'll try.<br> Aah! Pain! Pain! Pain! That's all I got, Captain waves and waves of searing pain.<br> It's in agony.<br> ''No kill I.<br>'' What is that, a plea for us not to kill it, or a promise that it won't kill us? I don't know, Captain.<br> Evidently, it gained an immediate knowledge of us from its empathy with me.<br> In my brief contact with the creature's mind, I discovered it is a highly intelligent, extremely sophisticated animal in great pain, of course, because of its wound, but not reacting at all like a wounded creature.<br> It calls itself a Horta.<br> A Horta.<br> A Horta! Mr.<br> Spock, we need that retardation mechanism.<br> You must reestablish communications with it.<br> Captain, it has no reason to give us the device, and apparently every reason for wishing us off this planet.<br> I'm aware of that.<br> If we could only win its confidence.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, this is Captain Kirk.<br> [McCoy] Yes, Captain? Grab your medical kit and come down here on the double.<br> Is somebody injured? What happened? Never mind.<br> Just come down to the 23rd level.<br> You'll be led to us by tricorder readings.<br> Jim, I remind you that this is a silicon-based form of life.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy's medical knowledge will be useless.<br> He's a healer, let him heal.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you must reestablish communications.<br> I want to know why it suddenly took to murder.<br> To obtain that kind of communication, Captain, it will be necessary to touch it.<br> We have seen how the creature destroys.<br> Lieutenant Commander Giotto.<br> Giotto here, Captain.<br> Are you all right? Perfectly all right.<br> Where are you? We're at the end of the tunnel.<br> A Mr.<br> Vanderberg and his men are here, and they're pretty ugly.<br> Shall I let them through? Under no circumstances allow them in here yet.<br> The minute Doc McCoy gets there, send him through.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Pity! The thousands Devils! Eternity ends The chamber of the ages The altar of tomorrow! [Spock] Murderers! Stop them! Kill! Strike back! Monsters! What in the name of What is Spock doing? It's wounded--badly.<br> You've got to help it.<br> Help that? Go take a look.<br> [Spock] The end of life Murderers.<br> You can't be serious.<br> That thing is virtually made out of stone! Help it.<br> Treat it.<br> I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.<br> You're a healer.<br> There's a patient.<br> That's an order.<br> Mr.<br> Spock Tell it we're trying to help.<br> The mechanism.<br> Understood.<br> Is the end of life Eternity stops Go out into the tunnel.<br> To the chamber of the ages.<br> Cry for the children.<br> Walkcarefully in the vault of tomorrow.<br> [Sobbing] Sorrowfor the murdered children.<br> The thing you search for is there.<br> Go.<br> Go.<br> Sadness.<br> Sadness for the end of things.<br> Go into the tunnel.<br> There is a passage way.<br> Quickly, quickly.<br> The captain said for you to wait here, and here is where you'll wait.<br> That murdering monster's in there.<br> We're going to kill it.<br> You're going to stay here.<br> That's right, Lieutenant.<br> Just beam it down to me immediately, and never mind what I want it for.<br> I just want it! Now move! It is time to sleep.<br> It is over.<br> Failure.<br> The murderers have won.<br> Death is welcome.<br> Let it end here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock Mr.<br> Spock Spock Spock Come out of it.<br> I found the unit in there.<br> It's in pretty good shape.<br> I also found about a million of these silicon nodules.<br> They're eggs, aren't they? Yes, Captain, eggs and about to hatch.<br> Miners must have broken into the hatchery.<br> Their operations destroyed thousands.<br> No wonder.<br> There.<br> They're coming.<br> All right! All right, let's go! Come on.<br> How are you doing, Doc? I'll let you know.<br> [Running Footsteps] All right, let's get them! Don't fire.<br> First man that fires is dead.<br> That thing has killed You've killed thousands of her children.<br> What? Those round silicon nodules you've been collecting and destroying? They're her eggs.<br> Tell them, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> There have been many generations of Horta on this planet.<br> Every 50,000 years, the entire race dies, all but one, like this one, but the eggs live.<br> She cares for them protects them.<br> And when they hatch, she is the mother to them, thousands of them.<br> This creature here is the mother of her race.<br> The Horta is intelligent peaceful mild.<br> She had no objection to sharing this planet with you, till you broke into her nursery and started destroying her eggs.<br> Then she fought back the only way she knew how, as any mother would when her children are in danger.<br> We didn't know.<br> How could we? You mean, if these eggs hatch, thousands of those things will be crawling around down here? This is where they live.<br> They digest rock.<br> They tunnel for nourishment.<br> And they are the most inoffensive of creatures.<br> They harbor no ill will.<br> Look, we have pergium to deliver.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Here's your circulating pump.<br> You've complained this planet is a mineralogical treasure house if you had the equipment to get at it.<br> The Horta moves through rock the way we move through air, leaving tunnels.<br> The greatest natural miners in the universe.<br> It seems to me we could make an agreement, reach a modus vivendi.<br> They tunnel.<br> You collect and process, and your process operation would be a thousand times more profitable.<br> It sounds all right if it will work.<br> Except for one thing.<br> The Horta is badly wounded.<br> It may die.<br> It won't die! I'm beginning to think I can cure a rainy day.<br> Can you help it? Help it? I cured it.<br> How? I had the ship beam down thermal concrete we use to build emergency shelters.<br> It's mostly silicon.<br> I just troweled it into the wound.<br> It'll act like a bandage until it heals.<br> Take a look.<br> It's as good as new.<br> You'll have to get in touch with the Horta again.<br> Tell her our proposition.<br> She and her children can tunnel.<br> Our people will remove the minerals.<br> Each side leaves the other alone.<br> Think she'll go for it? It seems logical, Captain.<br> The Horta has a very logical mind.<br> And after close association with humans, I find that curiously refreshing.<br> Ship ready to leave orbit, Captain.<br> Course laid in.<br> Very good, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Chief Engineer Vanderberg standing by on channel 1.<br> Fine.<br> Yes, Chief.<br> Kirk here.<br> Just wanted to tell you the eggs are hatching.<br> First thing the little devils do is start to tunnel.<br> We've already hit huge new pergium deposits.<br> I'm afraid to tell you how much gold, platinum, and rare ores we've uncovered.<br> I'm delighted to hear that, Chief.<br> Once Mother Horta tells her kids what to look for, you'll all be embarrassingly rich.<br> The Horta aren't so bad once you're used to their appearance.<br> That's about it, Kirk.<br> Thanks for everything.<br> Our pleasure, Chief.<br> Kirk out.<br> Curious.<br> What Chief Vanderberg said about the Horta is exactly what the Mother Horta said to me.<br> She found humanoid appearance revolting, but she thought she could get used to it.<br> Oh, she did, did she? Did she happen to make any comment about those ears? Not specifically.<br> But I did get the distinct impression she found them the most attractive human characteristic of all.<br> I couldn't bear to tell her that only I have-- She really liked those ears? Captain, the Horta is a remarkably intelligent and sensitive creature with impeccable taste.<br> Because she approved of you.<br> Really, Captain, my modesty Does not bear close examination, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I suspect you're becoming more and more human all the time.<br> You Captain, I see no reason to stand here and be insulted.<br> Ahead, warp factor 2.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Oh, yes.<br> Our council chambers are nearby.<br> Please.<br> Captain, if you don't mind, I should like to wander about the village and make some studies.<br> Of course, my friend.<br> Our village is yours.<br> Captain.<br> Gentlemen, my government has informed me that the Klingons are expected to move against your planet with the objective of making it a base of operation against the Federation.<br> My mission, frankly, is to keep them from doing it.<br> What you're saying is that we seem to have a choice between dealing with you or your enemies.<br> No, sir.<br> With the Federation, you have a choice.<br> You have none with the Klingons.<br> The Klingons are a military dictatorship.<br> War is their way of life.<br> Life under the Klingon rule would be very unpleasant.<br> We offer you protection.<br> We thank you for your altruistic offer, Captain, but we really do not need your protection.<br> We are a simple people.<br> We have nothing that anybody could want.<br> You have this planet and its strategic location.<br> I assure you that if you don't take action to prevent it, the Klingons will move against you as surely as your sun rises.<br> We will help you build defenses, build facilities.<br> We have no defenses, Captain, nor are any needed.<br> Gentlemen I have seen what the Klingons do to planets like yours.<br> They are organized into vast slave labor camps.<br> No freedoms whatsoever.<br> Your goods will be confiscated.<br> Hostages taken, killed.<br> Your leaders confined.<br> Be far better off on a penal planet.<br> Infinitely better off.<br> Captain, we see that your concern is genuine.<br> We are moved.<br> But again we assure you we are in absolutely no danger.<br> If anybody's in danger, you are.<br> That concerns us greatly.<br> It would be better if you returned to your ship right away.<br> You keep insisting there's no danger.<br> I keep assuring you there is.<br> It is our way of life, Captain.<br> That's the first thing that would be lost! Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> I'm a soldier, not a diplomat.<br> I can only tell you the truth.<br> If you'll excuse us, we will discuss your kind offer.<br> Yes, certainly.<br> Captain, our information on these people and their culture is not correct.<br> This is not a primitive society making progress toward mechanization.<br> They are totally stagnant.<br> There is no evidence of any progress as far back as my tricorder can register.<br> That doesn't seem likely.<br> Nevertheless, it is true.<br> For tens of thousands of years, there has been absolutely no advancement, no significant change in their physical environment.<br> This is a laboratory specimen of an arrested culture.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> that might be useful.<br> We have discussed your offer, Captain.<br> Our opinion is unchanged.<br> We are in no danger.<br> Thank you for your kind offer of assistance, although we must decline it, and we strongly recommend that you leave Organia before you yourselves are endangered.<br> Gentlemen, I must get you to reconsider.<br> We can be of immense help to you.<br> In addition to military aid, we can send you specialists, technicians.<br> We can show you how to feed a thousand people where one was fed before.<br> We can help you build schools, educate the young in the latest scientific skills.<br> Your public facilities are almost nonexistent.<br> We can help you remake your world, end disease, hunger, hardship.<br> And all we ask in return is that you let us help you.<br> Now.<br> Captain, I can see that you do not understand us.<br> [Communicator Beeps] Excuse me, sir.<br> Kirk here.<br> A large number of Klingon vessels have just arrived.<br> Nobody fire.<br> [Kirk] Positive identification.<br> My screens are up.<br> I can't drop them to beam you aboard.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, follow your orders.<br> Get out of here.<br> Contact the fleet.<br> Return if the odds are more equal.<br> Kirk out.<br> You insisted there was no danger-- That is correct, Captain.<br> There is no danger.<br> Eight space vehicles have assumed orbit around our planet.<br> They are activating their material transmission units.<br> Thank you, Trefayne.<br> Can you verify that? Negative, Captain, but it seems a logical development.<br> Since it is too late for you to escape, perhaps we should be protecting you.<br> If you had listened to me -- We must be sure you are not harmed.<br> Ayelborne, several hundred men have appeared near the citadel.<br> They bring many weapons.<br> How does he know that? Oh, our friend Trefayne is really quite intuitive.<br> Rest assured that what he says is absolutely correct.<br> So, we're stranded here in the middle of a Klingon occupation army.<br> So it would seem.<br> Not a very pleasant prospect.<br> You have a gift for understatement, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It's not a very pleasant prospect at all.<br> Captain 's Log.<br> : star date 3201.<br>7.<br> Mr.<br> Spock and I are trapped on the planet Organia, which is in the process of being occupied by the forces of the Klingon Empire.<br> The Organians have provided us with native clothing in the hopes we may be taken for Organians.<br> Captain, our phasers are gone.<br> Did you take them? Yes, Captain.<br> I took them.<br> I must ask you to return them.<br> I cannot do that.<br> You might be tempted to use violence, and that we cannot permit.<br> You, Captain, will pass as an Organian, and Mr.<br> Spock Mr.<br> Spock presents a problem.<br> He doesn't look like an Organian.<br> A Vulcan trader perhaps.<br> A dealer in kevoss and trilium.<br> Harmless to the Klingons.<br> They know that Vulcan is a Federation member.<br> Vulcan merchants are not uncommon, Captain.<br> It is a practical approach.<br> What about the rest of you? We shall continue as before.<br> We have nothing to fear.<br> You have a lot to learn, sir.<br> And if I know the Klingons, you'll be learning it the hard way.<br> This is the ruling council? I am Ayelborne, temporary head of the council.<br> I bid you welcome.<br> No doubt you do.<br> I am Kor, military governor of Organia.<br> Who are you? He is Barona, one of our leading citizens.<br> And he has no tongue? I have a tongue.<br> Good.<br> You will be taught how to use it.<br> Where is your smile? My what? The stupid, idiotic smile everyone else seems to be wearing.<br> A Vulcan.<br> Do you also have a tongue? I am Spock, a dealer in kevoss and trilium.<br> You do not look like a storekeeper.<br> Take this man.<br> Vulcans are members of the Federation.<br> He may be a spy.<br> He's no spy.<br> Wellhave we a ram among the sheep? You object to us taking him? He's done nothing.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Coming from an Organian, yours is practically an act of rebellion.<br> Very good.<br> So you welcome me.<br> Do you also welcome me? You're here.<br> There's nothing I can do about it.<br> Good honest hatred.<br> Very refreshing.<br> However, it makes no difference whether you welcome me or not.<br> I am here and will stay.<br> You are now subjects of the Klingon Empire.<br> You'll find there are many rules and regulations.<br> They will be posted.<br> Violation of the smallest of them will be punished by death.<br> We shall obey your regulations, Commander.<br> You disapprove, Barona.<br> You need my approval? I need your obedience.<br> Nothing more.<br> Will I have it? You seem to be in command.<br> Yes.<br> I am.<br> I shall need a representative from among you.<br> Liaison between the forces of the occupation and the civil population.<br> Smile and smile.<br> I don't trust men who smile too much.<br> You, Barona, you're the man.<br> Me? I don't want the job.<br> Have I asked whether or not you want it? We Klingons have a reputation for ruthlessness.<br> You will find that it is deserved.<br> Should one Klingon soldier be killed, a thousand Organians will die.<br> I will have order.<br> Is that clear? Commander, I assure you, our people want nothing but peace.<br> We shall cause you no trouble.<br> I'm sure you will not.<br> Take the Vulcan to the examination room.<br> You, come with me.<br> I will familiarize you with your new duties.<br> What about Mr.<br> Spock? You are concerned.<br> He is my friend.<br> You have a poor choice of friends.<br> He will be examined.<br> If he is lying, he will die.<br> If he is telling the truth he will find that business has taken a turn for the worse.<br> Take him.<br> You do not like to be pushed.<br> Very good.<br> You may be a man I can deal with, Barona.<br> Come with me.<br> \"From this day on, no public assemblages of more than three people.<br> All publications to be cleared through this office.<br>\" Neighborhood controls will be established, hostages selected a somewhat lengthy list of crimes against the state.<br> You do not like them? Well? He is what he claims to be, commander-- a Vulcanian merchant named Spock.<br> His main concern seems to be how he would carry out his business under our occupation.<br> Nothing else? The usual -- a certain amount of apprehension regarding us.<br> His mind is remarkably disciplined.<br> You are sure? I used force 4 which is sufficient to break down any pretense.<br> Very well, Lieutenant.<br> Would you like to try our little truth finder? I don't understand it.<br> It's a mind-sifter or mind ripper, depending on how much force is used.<br> We can record every thought every bit of knowledge in a man's mind.<br> Of course, when that much force is used, the mind is emptied permanently, I'm afraid.<br> What's left is more vegetable than human.<br> And you're proud of it.<br> It is a tool a weapon.<br> Somewhat drastic, but very efficient.<br> Are you sure you're all right? Perfectly, Barona.<br> But it was an interesting experience.<br> All right, Vulcan, you may go.<br> But you are an enemy alien.<br> You will be under our scrutiny at all times.<br> If I have to warn you Not necessary, Commander.<br> I understand you Very well.<br> Return to your council, Barona.<br> You will receive our official notifications as soon as they are published.<br> In the meantime keep the people in order.<br> It is your responsibility.<br> Or I will be killed.<br> That is exactly right.<br> You will be killed.<br> That mind-sifter can't be all the terror they think it is.<br> It should not be under estimated.<br> It reaches directly into the mind.<br> We Vulcans have certain mental -- certain disciplines which enable me to maintain a shield.<br> Without those disciplines, there would be no protection.<br> I'll try and avoid it.<br> Out of the way, Organian.<br> I'm sorry, sir.<br> We did not notice you.<br> Next time, keep your eyes open, or I'll shut them permanently.<br> Captain, I strongly suggest we direct our energies toward the immediate problem -- accomplishing our mission here.<br> Did you really think I'd beat his head in? I thought you might.<br> You're right.<br> But we still have a job to do.<br> We'll receive no help from the Organians.<br> Eventually, they'll start resenting how the Klingons run things.<br> If we could prove to them they could strike back to keep the Klingons off balance.<br> Verbal persuasion seems to be ineffective.<br> Perhaps a more direct approach.<br> That's exactly what I had in mind.<br> Didn't I see something that looked like a munitions dump outside of Kor's headquarters? You did.<br> I think it's time we did a little simple and plain communicating.<br> Tonight.<br> A very meritorious idea, Captain.<br> We're short of tools.<br> I'm certain the Klingons will provide whatever is necessary.<br> It's a pleasure doing business with you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> O.<br>K.<br> so far.<br> Sonic grenade.<br> With a delayed-action fuse.<br> Good.<br> These crates contain chemical explosives.<br> They should make a most satisfactory display.<br> [Explosion] You were right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A most satisfactory display.<br> Of course we blew it up.<br> Deliberately.<br> But that was violence.<br> You can fight back.<br> Instead of sheep, you can be wolves.<br> Terribleto destroy.<br> History is full of examples of civil populations fighting back successfully against a military dictatorship.<br> We may not destroy the Klingons, but we can blow up their installations, disrupt their communications, make Organia useless to them.<br> Our fleet will eventually arrive.<br> Meanwhile, the battle is ours.<br> It can be a successful one.<br> Captain, I implore you never to do such a thing again.<br> Why? Are you afraid of retribution? Does your personal freedom mean nothing to you? How little you understand us, Captain.<br> I understand you don't have the backbone to fight and protect your loved ones.<br> You speak of courage, gentlemen.<br> Does courage mean so little to you? [Footsteps] You speak of courage.<br> Obviously you don't know the difference between courage and fool hardiness.<br> Always it is the brave ones who die.<br> The soldiers.<br> I hope you will continue to savor the sweetness of your life.<br> You disgust me.<br> What'll you do with him, Commander? What is always done with spies and saboteurs.<br> He will be killed after he has had first-hand experience of our mind scanner.<br> There's no need to use your machine, commander.<br> I'll tell you his name.<br> It is Captain James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Ayelborne.<br> What? Captain of the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> A starship commander.<br> And his first officer? Hmm.<br> I had hoped to meet you in battle, but For some reason, he feels he must destroy you, Just as you feel you must destroy him.<br> That's going to be rather difficult now.<br> Isn't it, Captain? What an admirable people.<br> Do you always betray your friends? I didn't want you to harm him.<br> I'm sorry, Captain.<br> It was for the best.<br> No harm will come of it.<br> I'm used to the idea of dying, but I have no desire to die for the likes of you.<br> I don't blame you, Captain.<br> Lock up the Vulcan.<br> Take the Captain to my office.<br> We'll have a talk before I do what must be done.<br> Have a drink with me, Captain? No, thank you.<br> I assure you, it isn't drugged.<br> With our mind scanner, we have no need for such crude methods.<br> What do you want from me? Oh, a very great deal, but first I want to talk.<br> Just talk.<br> You think I'm going to sit here and just talk with the enemy? You'll talk.<br> Either here, now, voluntarily, or under our mind scanner.<br> The fact is, Captain, I have a great admiration for your starfleet.<br> A remarkable instrument.<br> and I must confess to a certain admiration for you.<br> I know, of course, that it was you who destroyed our supplies last night.<br> Something was destroyed? Nothing inconsequential, I hope.<br> [Chuckling] Hardly.<br> They were quite important to us, but they can be replaced.<br> You of the Federation, you are much like us.<br> We're nothing like you.<br> We're a democratic body.<br> Come now.<br> I'm not referring to minor ideological differences.<br> I mean that we are similar as a species.<br> Here we are on a planet of sheep, two tigers, predators, hunters killers, and it is precisely that which makes us great.<br> And there's a universe to be taken.<br> It's a very large universe, Commander, full of people who don't like the Klingons.<br> Excellent.<br> Then it shall be a matter of testing each other's wills.<br> Of power.<br> Survival must be earned, Captain.<br> Tell me about the dispersal of your starfleet.<br> Go climb a tree.<br> Hmm.<br> I can get what I want through our mind scanner, but there would be very little of your mind left, Captain.<br> I have no desire to see you become a vegetable.<br> This friend of yours, the Vulcan.<br> He seems to have the ability to block our scanner.<br> I think perhaps I will find out why.<br> I will have him dissected.<br> Your friend killed.<br> You a mental vegetable.<br> Not a pleasant prospect, Captain, but it lies ahead for you unless you tell me everything I want to know.<br> It will take a lot longer than that, commander.<br> Longer than that I will not wait.<br> I respect you, Captain, but this is war, a game we Klingons play to win.<br> Take him to the cell with his friend.<br> And watch him closely.<br> It's no use, Jim.<br> There's no way out.<br> How much of the 12 hours do we have left? if the Klingons are punctual.<br> We can count on them being punctual.<br> Blowing that munitions dump wasn't enough.<br> We get out of here, we've got to carry the attack directly to Kor.<br> These Organians they do not seem to understand.<br> Most peculiar.<br> Nevertheless, our orders still stand.<br> We've got to make some attempt to neutralize the Klingon occupation.<br> We may not get the chance, Captain.<br> These walls are very thick.<br> And there are guards every few feet down the hall.<br> [Banging] Oh, there you are, gentlemen.<br> I trust you're in good health? Shall we go? Go? Your captors plan to do violence to you.<br> That we cannot permit.<br> I came to take you away.<br> You turned us over to them.<br> You expect us to trust you now? Is there really a choice, Captain? I offer you safety.<br> This is the first place they'll look.<br> They will not come here, Captain.<br> You turn us in, then get us out.<br> Are you waiting for a reward so you can turn us in again? How little you understand us, Captain.<br> Nor do we understand what happened to the guards.<br> Do not concern yourself about them.<br> What happened to them? Why, nothing happened to them, Captain.<br> Nothing at all.<br> Commander! Don't you see I'm busy? The two Federation prisoners-- they're gone.<br> You mean they've escaped? No one was at fault.<br> constantly on duty watching the cell.<br> When they opened it to give them food, they simply weren't there.<br> There was no way out.<br> If you're lying to me I swear! All right, Lieutenant.<br> Implement Special Occupation Order Number Four.<br> Immediately! Sir! That's all you can do, smile? You are free, Captain.<br> I want to know how I'm free and why.<br> There are questions I'd like to ask as well.<br> This idiotic placidity of yours, your refusal to do anything to protect your selves We have already answered that question.<br> To us, violence is unthinkable.<br> Attention.<br> Attention all Organians.<br> Attention.<br> This is Commander Kor.<br> The two Federation prisoners have escaped, obviously with outside aid.<br> They will be returned immediately.<br> So that you will know we mean what we say listen.<br> [Phaser] Those are Klingon phasers.<br> Take the door.<br> Get down, gentlemen.<br> In the courtyard of my headquarters have just been killed.<br> In 2 hours, and 200 more after that until the two Federation spies are turned over to us.<br> This is the order of Kor.<br> Did you hear them? Yes, of course, Captain.<br> But nothing has changed.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock It seems it's up to you and me.<br> It would appear so, Captain.<br> The Federation has invested much money in our training.<br> They're due for a small return.<br> We have two hours with which to do it in.<br> Only two.<br> More Organians will die.<br> No more will die on account of us.<br> Where are those phasers? I can't tell you.<br> You've told us you hate violence.<br> Unless you tell me where those phasers are, you'll have more violence than you know what to do with.<br> You mean you would actually use force? It's entirely up to you.<br> Ayelborne, perhaps you'd better let him have what he wants.<br> Very well.<br> But it will do you no good.<br> They're in that cabinet.<br> Gentlemen, I have no great love for you, your planet, your culture.<br> Despite that, Mr.<br> Spock and I are going to go out there and quite probably die in an attempt to show you that there are some things worth dying for.<br> There are only two of you against an army.<br> Don't you realize that what you intend to do will be hopeless? Come on, Mr.<br> Spock, let's get out of here.<br> Brave men.<br> Yes, but so foolish.<br> Interesting, however.<br> Of course we cannot allow it.<br> To stop them is very bad.<br> If it's necessary, they may harm one another.<br> Trefayne.<br> They will wait until darkness.<br> And then? Terrible, inconceivable, savage.<br> [Sighs] We will wait.<br> [Dog Barking] Mr.<br> Spock, can we get those two guards? What are the odds on our getting out of here? Difficult to be precise, Captain.<br> I should say approximately Difficult to be precise? That's a pretty close approximation.<br> I endeavor to be accurate.<br> You do quite well.<br> Set your phaser on stun.<br> We're after the top dog, not the members of the pack.<br> Very good.<br> But if the situation calls for it, we kill.<br> Clear, Captain.<br> I'll take the one on the left.<br> Fire.<br> It has begun.<br> Very well.<br> It will be hard.<br> Prepare yourselves.<br> No results, Commander.<br> Nothing? I cannot understand these people.<br> They know what death is, don't they? They do not seem to be worried about anything.<br> Bad enough to be a military governor.<br> But to govern a population of sheep? Very well, Lieutenant, round up 200 more.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Fools! Will I have to kill them all? If you don't tell me what I want to know, I'll kill you here and now, is that clear? Yes, that's clear.<br> Is Kor's office down there? Yes.<br> What about the hostages? Talk.<br> Talk.<br> I am to gather 200 more.<br> To be killed? Yes.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Uh! Well, what are the odds now? Less than 7,000-to-1, Captain.<br> It's remarkable we've gotten this far.<br> Less than 7,000-to-1 .<br> Wellgetting better.<br> Getting better.<br> Just stay where you are, Commander.<br> You have done well to get this far through my guards.<br> I believe you'll find that several of them are no longer in perfect operating condition.<br> So you are here.<br> You will be interested in knowing that a Federation fleet is on its way here at the moment.<br> Our fleet is preparing to meet them.<br> Checkmate, commander.<br> Shall we wait and see the results before you, uh kill me? I don't intend to kill you unless I have to.<br> Ah, sentimentality mercy the emotions of peace your weakness, Captain Kirk.<br> The Klingon Empire shall win.<br> Think of it, as we sit here, in space above us, the destiny of the galaxy will be decided for the next 10,000 years.<br> Can I offer you a drink? We can toast the victory of the Klingon fleet.<br> You may be premature.<br> There are many possibilities.<br> Today we conquer.<br> Though if some day we are defeated, well, war has its fortunes good and bad.<br> Do you know why we are so strong? Because we are a unit.<br> Each of us is part of the greater whole, always under surveillance.<br> Even a commander like myself.<br> Always under surveillance, Captain.<br> If you will note.<br> Come on, Spock! Back! Shoot! Shoot! Oh! Aah! Oh! - Aah! - Aah! What is it, Spock? Inexplicable, Captain.<br> Extreme heat.<br> The weapons and the bodies.<br> Aah! We are terribly sorry to be forced to interfere, gentlemen, but we cannot permit you to harm yourselves.<br> What are you talking about? We have put a stop to your violence.<br> Youare stopping this? You? All instruments of violence on this planet now radiate a temperature of 350 degrees.<br> They are inoperative.<br> My fleet! The same conditions exist on both the starfleets.<br> There will be no battle.<br> Ridiculous! I suggest you contact them.<br> You, too, Captain.<br> Your ship is now within range of your communications device.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Captain I--I can't explain it.<br> We were just closing in on the Klingon fleet when every control on our ship became too hot to handle.<br> Our power is gone.<br> Our phaser banks are dead.<br> Stand by, Sulu.<br> My fleet it's helpless.<br> What have you done? As I stand here, I also stand upon the home planet of the Klingon Empire and the home planet of your Federation, Captain.<br> I'm putting a stop to this insane war.<br> You're what? You're talking nonsense.<br> It is being done.<br> You canÂt just stop the fleet.<br> What gives you the right? You can't interfere.<br> What happens in space is not your business.<br> Unless both sides agree to an immediate cessation of hostilities, all your armed forces, wherever they may be, will be immediately immobilized.<br> We have legitimate grievances against the Klingons.<br> They've invaded our territory, killed our citizens.<br> They're openly aggressive.<br> They've boasted that they'll take over half the galaxy.<br> Why not? We're the stronger! You've hemmed us in! You've asked for war! You issued the ultimatum to withdraw from the disputed areas! They're not disputed! They're clearly ours.<br> And now you step in with some kind of trick.<br> It is no trick, Commander.<br> We have simply put an end to your war.<br> All your military forces, wherever they are, are now completely paralyzed.<br> We find interference in other people's affairs most disgusting, But you gentlemen have given us no choice.<br> You should be on our side.<br> No one has been killed, Captain.<br> No one has died here in uncounted thousands of years.<br> You are liars.<br> You are meddling in things that are none of your business.<br> Even if you have some power that we don't understand you have no right to dictate to our Federation -- Or our empire! How to handle our interstellar relations! We have the right -- To wage war, Captain? To kill millions of innocent people? To destroy life on a planetary scale? Is that what you're defending? Well, no one wants war but there are proper channels.<br> People have a right to handle their own affairs.<br> Eventually, we will Oh, eventually, you will have peace, but only after millions of people have died.<br> It is true that in the future, you and the Klingons will become fast friends.<br> You will work together.<br> Never! Your emotions are most discordant.<br> We do not wish to seem inhospitable, but, gentlemen, you must leave.<br> Yes.<br> Please leave us.<br> The mere presence of beings like yourselves is intensely painful to us.<br> What do you mean, \"Beings like yourselves?\" Millions of years ago, Captain we were humanoid, like yourselves, but we have developed beyond the need of physical bodies.<br> That of us which you see is mere appearance for your sake.<br> Captain, it's a trick.<br> We can handle them.<br> I have an army.<br> Fascinating.<br> Pure energy pure thought totally incorporeal not life as we know it at all.<br> But what about this planet? The fields, the buildings, this citadel? Conventionalizations, I should say useless to the Organians, created so that visitors, such as ourselves, could have conventional points of reference.<br> But is all of this possible? We have seen it with our own eyes.<br> I should say the Organians are as far above us on the evolutionary scale as we are above the amoeba.<br> Well, Commander, I guess that takes care of the war.<br> Obviously, the Organians aren't going to let us fight.<br> A shame, Captain.<br> It would have been glorious.<br> You've been most restrained since we left Organia.<br> I'm embarrassed.<br> I was furious with the Organians for stopping a war I didn't want.<br> We think of ourselves as the most powerful beings in the universe.<br> It's unsettling to discover that we're wrong.<br> Captain it took millions of years for the Organians to evolve into what they are.<br> Even the gods did not spring into being overnight.<br> You and I have no reason to be embarrassed.<br> We did, after all, beat the odds.<br> Oh, no, no, no, Mr.<br> Spock, We didn't beat the odds.<br> We didn't have a chance.<br> The Organians raided the game.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

And if they are, by whom? For what purpose? Your guess, Captain.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I have considered all the alternatives.<br> My best guess is it could be a prelude to invasion.<br> Exactly our consensus.<br> I'm giving you the job of finding out specifically.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Can you assign me other starships as a reserve?

Negative, Captain.<br> Anything from our guest? According to him, there's a creature here, a humanoid.<br> Lieutenant Uhura communicated that information.<br> I ordered reconfirmation on our sensors.<br> They indicate no living creature on this planet.<br> I suggest, Captain, that you've been lied to.<br> Captain, you yourself said there were no other explanations.<br> Why do you give credence to this man? I fail to comprehend your indignation, sir.<br> I've simply made the logical deduction that you are a liar.<br> Let's have the truth this time.<br> No! You've come back, then? Well, don't stop.<br> Here I am.<br> Come at me again.<br> We'll finish it! Can you identify that? I'm trying, Captain.<br> Lazarus! You stay here.<br> All personnel, security red.<br> Run!Run!

I saw it again, the thing.<br> It attacked me.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Captain, readings of the effect indicate it centered here on this planet, almost on this very spot.<br> I told you it was a thing-- all white, black and empty, a terrible emptiness.<br> Let's get back to the ship.<br> He'll kill us all if we don't kill him first! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Captain's Log, Stardate 3088.<br>3.<br> We continue to orbit the dead planet, which seems to be the source of the phenomenon which has struck the Enterprise and all sections of the galaxy once again.<br> As for Lazarus, the story he tells me about the humanoid continues to trouble me.<br> Any luck? Negative, Captain.<br> I can no more explain the second phenomenon than I can the first.<br> If there's a shred of truth to what Lazarus said That a single creature, a humanoid could be responsible for an effect of such magnitude? Hard to believe.<br> Indeed.<br> The rest of his story fits.<br> His wounds testify to an apparent confrontation.<br> Affirmative.<br> Assuming there is a humanoid, asomething, how does he do it? He has no weapons, no power-- Captain, I know that the occurrence of the phenomenon coincides exactly with the moments that Lazarus has his alleged confrontations.<br> [Intercom Whistles] Dr.<br> McCoy asking to see you in Sick Bay, Captain.<br> I don't know,Jim.<br> Maybe I'm imagining things, and maybe I'm not.<br> You tell me.<br> You tell me.<br> That's why you brought me down here.<br> We both brought Lazarus here.<br> I treated a deep abrasion on his forehead, then I bandaged it, stepped into this room for just a moment-- Bones, get to the point.<br> Say he's got the constitution of a dinosaur, recuperative powers, ditto.<br> As we both know, I'm a bright young medic with a miraculous touch.<br> Why, then, when I returned, there wasn't a trace ofthat wound on his forehead not even a bruise.<br> It was like he had never been injured.<br> Where is he? I don't know,Jim.<br> This is a big ship.<br> I'm just a country doctor.<br> Hi.<br> Hi.<br> Coffee? Is that an order, Lieutenant? I know what you mean.<br> We finished on the dilithium crystals? Yeah.<br> Ready and waiting.<br> Lazarus, are you all right? Uh, yes, sir but impatient.<br> Have you decided to help me yet? Is something wrong? No.<br> I have a ship's physician with a strange sense of humor.<br> This is no joke.<br> I know what I saw.<br> [Uhura] Bridge calling the captain.<br> [Spock] Request you come to the bridge, Captain.<br> Find something? Something quite extraordinary.<br> On my way.<br> Lazarus, you're with me.<br> Bones, if I had time, I'd laugh.<br> Main screen on, Lieutenant.<br> Screen on, sir.<br> Source of radiation, Captain.<br> How is it the scanners didn't pick it up before? Because it is not there.<br> Another riddle? First Dr.<br> McCoy, then you? According to our usual scanning procedures, there's nothing there that could be causing that effect.<br> But it is there.<br> Affirmative.<br> I confess I am somewhat at a loss for words.<br> It may be described, though loosely and inaccurately, as arip in our universe.<br> What? A kind of physical warp, Captain, where none ofour physical laws apply with any regularity.<br> However, with the dilithium crystals, I was able to localize it.<br> Yes! That's it! The dilithium crystals.<br> Their power we could do it.<br> You refer to the humanoid? Yes.<br> We've got him, Captain.<br> The crystals only show the point of radiation.<br> That's just it.<br> That's the key.<br> That's the way to trap him.<br> That's the solution.<br> Captain I beg of you.<br> I plead.<br> I demand.<br> Give me the crystals.<br> Out of the question.<br> Those crystals power my ship.<br> You fool.<br> There won't be any ship if we don't kill him.<br> He'll destroy you all.<br> How? You tell me how! All I've heard is double-talk, lies, threats, accusations that don't hold water.<br> Tell me how it presents a danger to my ship.<br> I warn you, Captain.<br> You'll give me the crystals.<br> Don't threaten me, Lazarus.<br> No threat intended.<br> Captain I'll have my vengeance.<br> Lieutenant Masters, Captain's calling.<br> Masters here.<br> [Kirk] Lieutenant, can you prepare an experimentation chamber? All dilithium crystals fullpower.<br> I'll check, sir.<br> Captain, the chamber will be ready in 10 minutes.<br> My assistant and I were-- Captain! Captain! Lieutenant, what is it? What's wrong? Lieutenant? Captain, Security reports Lazarus missing.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 3088.<br>7.<br> We are no closer to finding an answer to the strange phenomenon than we were at the beginning.<br> Two of my crewmen were attacked, and two dilithium crystals are missing, and without them, the Enterprise cannot operate at fullpower.<br> They must be found.<br> Fact--you said you needed the crystals.<br> After you said you must have them, they're missing.<br> Fact--two of my crewmen were attacked.<br> And fact, Captain-- I didn't take the crystals.<br> I'm not the one.<br> Find my enemy.<br> Find the beast, and you'll find the crystals.<br> How'd this beast get aboard my ship? He did.<br> Isn't that enough? No.<br> He didn't transport up.<br> A report would've been made.<br> We're dealing with a creature capable of destroying worlds.<br> Why does he need the crystals? For what reason? For the same reason that I do.<br> Listen to me.<br> He's humanoid.<br> Why, he he can pilot a spaceship.<br> He can compute formulas to destroy races.<br> He can steal energy for his vehicle so he can escape from me.<br> Are you deafas well as blind? Sit down.<br> The crystals certainly aren't here.<br> There's an unexplained radiation source on the planet.<br> Obviously some connection.<br> We'll check it out.<br> Organize a search party immediately.<br> Mr.<br> Lazarus will beam down with us.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> You may not have reason to thank me, depending on what we find.<br> What do you believe now, Captain? I believe the missing crystals aren't in your ship.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? Unable to locate the source of radiation.<br> Why not? You had it spotted on the Enterprise! It has simply disappeared, Captain.<br> I want this terrain checked.<br> Look for footprint, movement--anything.<br> Call if you spot anything.<br> Don't be afraid to use your weapons.<br> [Thunder] [Hissing] [Thunder] [Hissing] [Hissing Stops] Captain, look out! Aah! [Thud] He's coming out of it now.<br> Uh, the thing the thing It's all right.<br> You're on board the Enterprise.<br> The rock, I-- How's your head? Aches.<br> You saved my life.<br> I want to thank you.<br> Why shouldn't I? I have some questions I want to ask you.<br> Not now, Jim.<br> It's necessary.<br> Go ahead.<br> It's all right.<br> This is a computer report of the evidence you gave at your first screening.<br> It calls you a liar, Lazarus.<br> There's no planet at the location you said you came from.<br> There never has been.<br> If you want help from us, you better start telling the truth.<br> You wouldn't believe me if I told you.<br> Try us.<br> All right.<br> I distorted a fact in the interest of self-preservation, for my holy cause.<br> I needed help, not censure, freedom, not captivity for being a madman.<br> I was afraid that's what you'd call me if I told you the truth.<br> I'll have the truth now.<br> My planet my Earth or what's left of it, is down there beneath us.<br> What are you saying? My spaceship is more than just that.<br> It's a time chamber a time ship and I I am a time traveler.<br> And this thing you search for is a time traveler, too? Oh, yes.<br> He's fled me across all the years all the empty years to a dead future on a murdered planet he destroyed.<br> Help me! Give me the tools I need to kill him! The crystals! Don't let him get away! You've been hurt.<br> I know.<br> I sympathize with you, but I've got 430 men to worry about.<br> Where are those crystals? I told you.<br> He's got them.<br> He took them.<br> The thing He's got to rest,Jim.<br> And get that muscleman out of my sick bay.<br> Dismissed.<br> He's in a lot of pain.<br> Sometimes pain can drive a man harder than pleasure.<br> I'm sure you know that, Doctor.<br> Well, don't worry.<br> He's not going anywhere, not this time.<br> Oh What have we got, Mr.<br> Spock? A magnetic effect which produces a winking-out phenomenon, a mysterious, unidentified source of radiation on the planet, Lazarus, a walking powder keg, your rip in the universe, a so-called murdering humanoid-- True, Captain, but more significant to me is the fact that our ship's instruments are designed to locate and identify any object in our universe, be it energy or matter.<br> But by using those instruments, you were unable to identify the source of the radiation.<br> Correct which would seem to be impossible.<br> Are the instruments in order? Perfect working condition.<br> Then what you say leads obviously to one alternative.<br> The source of radiation is not from our universe.<br> Nor in our universe, Captain.<br> It came from outside.<br> Outside Yes That would explain a lot.<br> Another universe perhaps in another dimension occupying the same space at the same time.<br> Possible existence of a parallel universe has been scientifically conceded, Captain.<br> All right.<br> What would happen if another universe, say a minus universe, came into contact with a positive universe such as ours? Unquestionably a warp, a distortion of physical laws on an immense scale.<br> Which is what we've been experiencing.<br> The point where they come into contact, couldn't that be described as a hole? Indeed.<br> I point out that a hole in the universe or in a simple container can either allow the contents to escape Or what is outside to enter.<br> The invasion that Commodore Barstow suspected.<br> There has been no evidence of a large-scale invasion.<br> But a small-scale invasion, Mr.<br> Spock? What is your analysis of the mental state of Lazarus? Difficult, Captain.<br> One moment, paranoid, the next, calm, mild, rational.<br> Almost as if he weretwo men.<br> Yes, two men.<br> Different, but identical.<br> And a hole in the universe.<br> No, not a hole.<br> A door.<br> Through which these two beings are somehow enabled to pass.<br> Take a look at Lazarus.<br> One minute he's at the point of death, the next, he's alive, well, strong as a bull.<br> The cut on his forehead.<br> First he has it, then it's gone, then he has it again.<br> Which is physically impossible for one man.<br> Quite right.<br> Unquestionably, there are two of him.<br> But what's going on? This leaping from universe to universe this wild talk about a murdering creature who destroys civilizations-- What's the purpose? Jim, madness has no purpose or reason but it may have a goal.<br> He must be stopped, held destroyed if necessary.<br> I don't follow you.<br> Two parallel universes-- project this-- one positive, the other negative or, more specifically, one matter the other antimatter.<br> Do you know what you're saying? Matter and antimatter have a tendency to cancel each other out violently.<br> Precisely.<br> Under certain conditions, when two identical particles of matter and antimatter meet Like Lazarus Identical Like both Lazarus only one is matter and the other antimatter.<br> If they meet Annihilation,Jim.<br> Total, complete absolute annihilation.<br> Of everything that exists everywhere.<br> [Beep] The energizer's shorted.<br> Get out of here.<br> Sound the alarm.<br> Come on.<br> You, too, Lieutenant.<br> I've got to stay-- The whole thing might blow! [Coughing] [Siren Wails] Engineering calling Bridge.<br> Fire! Fire in the energizing circuits [Siren Wails] Fire, Captain.<br> Engineering.<br> Situation critical.<br> All available personnel, on the double.<br> Spock, with me.<br> Report.<br> Controlled, but it couldn't have started by itself.<br> Lazarus-- a trick to get the crystals.<br> Sir, you shouldn't be in here.<br> Oh, I didn't know.<br> He's probably beaming down.<br> I'm going after him.<br> Organize a security detail.<br> Follow me as soon as you can.<br> Spock to Bridge.<br> I'll get you now.<br> I have a threshold.<br> Run, run I'll get you now.<br> [Siren Wails] Energize.<br> It's done.<br> Finished, finished.<br> It's done.<br> It's done.<br> It's done, it's done.<br> Lazarus No! Don't! Not you! No! Welcome, Captain.<br> I wasn't expecting you.<br> No him.<br> Yes, him.<br> You understand? Not completely.<br> This is a parallel universe? Of course.<br> Antimatter? Here, yes.<br> And if identical particles meet The end of everything.<br> Civilization, existence-- All gone.<br> I tried to stop him, Captain.<br> That's why I took your dilithium crystals.<br> He has two more.<br> That's very bad, Captain.<br> If he comes through at a time of his own choosing Well, I think if we hurry and you will help me, he can yet still be stopped.<br> There's little time left.<br> He meant to come through.<br> When you accidentally passed through, it drained his crystals.<br> It'll take him about 10 minutes to re-energize with the equipment aboard his ship.<br> That should give us enough time.<br> Exactly what did I pass through? That's hard to explain, Captain.<br> I call it an alternative warp.<br> It's sort of a negative magnetic corridor where the two parallel universes meet.<br> It's sort of a safety valve.<br> It keeps eternity from blowing up.<br> This, uh, corridor Is it what caused the magnetic effect, the winking-out phenomenon? Precisely, Captain but not because of its existence because because my foe entered.<br> The corridor is like a prison with explosives at the door.<br> Open the door, and the explosives might go off.<br> Stay inside And the universe is safe.<br> Both universes, Captain yours and mine.<br> Surely Lazarus must realize what would happen if you should meet face-to-face outside the corridor.<br> Of course he knows, Captain, but he's mad.<br> You heard him.<br> He's lost his mind.<br> When our people found a way to slip through the warp and prove another universe, an identical one, existed, it was too much for him.<br> He could not live knowing that I lived.<br> He became obsessed with the idea of destroying me.<br> The fact that it meant his own destruction and everything else meant nothing to him.<br> So you're the terrible thing, the murdering monster the creature? Yes, Captain.<br> Or he is.<br> It depends on your point of view, doesn't it? It's ready, Captain.<br> If we can force him into the corridor while I'm waiting, we can put an end to this.<br> If he comes through at a time of his own choosing and breaks into this universe to find me-- I understand.<br> What do you want me to do? Find him.<br> Force him through his threshold, while I'm waiting for him, into the corridor and I'll hold him there.<br> You can't hold him forever.<br> Can't l, Captain? You destroy his ship.<br> If I destroy his ship, won't yours also be destroyed? It will.<br> And your door will be closed.<br> Yes, and so will his.<br> You'll be trapped inside that corridor with him forever at each other's throats throughout time.<br> Is it such a large price to pay for the safety of two universes? I'm ready.<br> Send him to me.<br> I'll be waiting.<br> Lazarus.<br> Stand back.<br> No! No! No, I'm not ready! I'm not ready! Aah! Take these crystals to the Enterprise.<br> We must destroy that ship completely.<br> What of Lazarus? And what of Lazarus? [Siren Wails] Activate phaser banks.<br> Phaser banks activated.<br> Stand by to fire.<br> Phasers standing by, sir.<br> Fire phasers.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Lesley, let's get out of here.<br> Ahead warp factor 1.<br> Warp 1, sir.<br> Everything's all right, Mr.<br> Spock for us.<br> There is, of course, no escape for them, sir.<br> There is, of course, no escape.<br> How would it be trapped forever with a raging madman at your throat until time it selfcame to a stop? For eternity.<br> How would it be? Captain the universe is safe.<br> For you and me.<br> But what of Lazarus? What of Lazarus?   <br>\n                </div>",

I am both and neither.<br> I am my own beginning, my own ending.<br> I see no reason for answers to be couched in riddles.<br> I answer as simply as your level of understanding makes possible.<br> A time portal, Captain-- a gateway to other times and dimensions, if I'm correct.<br> As correct as possible for you.<br> Your science knowledge is obviously primitive.<br> Really? Annoyed, Spock? Behold.<br> A gateway to your own past, if you wish.<br> Killers! Killers! I won't let you get me! I'll kill you first! I won't let you get me! Assassins! Murderers! Killers! Spock! If that is a doorway back through time, could we somehow take Bones back a day in time, then Relive the accident, this time be certain that the hypo accident is avoided? Look at the speed with which the centuries are passing, Captain.<br> To step through on precisely the day we wish Guardian.<br> Can you change the speed at which yesterday passes? I was made to offer the past in this manner.<br> I cannot change.<br> Strangely compelling, isn't it? To step through there and lose oneself in another world.<br> I am a fool.<br> Our tricorder is capable of recording even at this speed.<br> I've missed taping centuries of living history which no man has ever -- Dr.<br> McCoy!

Why don't you watch where you're going? Theft, Captain? Well, we'll steal from the rich and give back to the poor later.<br> I think I'm going to like this century-- simple, easier to manage.<br> We're not going to have any difficulty explaining-- Ahem.<br> Well? You're a police officer.<br> I recognize the traditional accouterments.<br> You were saying you'll have no trouble explaining it.<br> My friend is obviously Chinese.<br> I see you've noticed the ears.<br> They're actually easy to explain.<br> Perhaps the unfortunate accident I had as a child.<br> The unfortunate accident he had as a child.<br> He caught his head in a mechanical rice picker.<br> But fortunately, there was an American missionary living close by who was actually a, uh skilled plastic surgeon in civilian life.<br> All right, all right! Drop those bundles and put your hands on that wall there! Come on! How careless of your wife to let you go out that way.<br> Oh, yes, it's quite untidy.<br> Here, let me help you.<br> Oh! [Whistle Blowing] You were actually enjoying my predicament back there.<br> At times, you seem quite human.<br> Captain, I hardly believe that insults are within your prerogative as my commanding officer.<br> Sorry.<br> Time we faced the unpleasant facts.<br> First, I believe we have about a week before McCoy arrives, but we can't be certain.<br> Arrives where-- Honolulu, Boise, San Diego? Why not Outer Mongolia, for that matter? There is a theory.<br> There could be some logic to the belief that time is fluid, like a river-- with currents, eddies, backwash.<br> And the same currents that swept McCoy to a certain time and place might sweep us there, too.<br> Unless that is true, Captain, we have no hope.<br> Frustrating-- locked in here is the place and moment of his arrival, even the images of what he did.<br> If only I could tie this tricorder in with the ship's computers for a few moments.<br> Couldn't you build some form of computer aid here? In this zinc-plated vacuum-tubed culture? Yes, well, it would pose an extremely complex problem in logic, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Excuse me.<br> I sometimes expect too much of you.<br> Who's there? Excuse us, miss.<br> We didn't mean to trespass.<br> It's cold outside.<br> A lie is a poor way to say hello.<br> It isn't that cold.<br> No.<br> We were being chased by a policeman.<br> Why? For these clothes.<br> We stole them.<br> We didn't have any money.<br> Well, I could do with some help around here -- doing dishes, sweeping, general cleaning.<br> At what rate of payment? I need radio tubes and so forth.<br> My hobby.<br> What are your names? Mine is Jim Kirk.<br> His is Spock.<br> I'm Edith Keeler.<br> You can start by cleaning up down here.<br> Excuse me, miss.<br> Where are we? You're in the 21st Street Mission.<br> Do you run this place? Indeed I do, Mr.<br> Kirk.<br> Radio tubes and so on.<br> I approve of hobbies, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Good evening.<br> You'll be sorry.<br> Why? You expect to eat for free or something? You got to listen to goody two-shoes.<br> Now, as I'm sure somebody out there has said, it's time to pay for the soup.<br> Not that she's bad-looking, but if she really wanted to help out a fella in need -- Shut up.<br> Shut up.<br> I want to hear what she has to say.<br> Yes, of course, Captain.<br> Now, let's start by getting one thing straight.<br> I'm not a do-gooder.<br> If you're a bum, if you can't break off of the booze or whatever it is that makes you a bad risk, then get out.<br> I don't pretend to tell you how to find happiness and love when every day is a struggle to survive, but I do insist that you do survive because the days and the years ahead are worth living for.<br> One day soon man is going to be able to harness incredible energies, maybe even the atom.<br> Energies that could ultimately hurl us to other worlds inin some sort of spaceship.<br> And the men that reach out into space will be able to find ways to feed the hungry millions of the world and to cure their diseases.<br> They will be able to find a way to give each man hope and a common future, and those are the days worth living for.<br> Our deserts will bloom.<br> Development of atomic power is years away.<br> Space flight, years after that.<br> Speculation.<br> Gifted insight.<br> But it will come.<br> I find her most uncommon, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Prepare for tomorrow.<br> Get ready.<br> Don't give up.<br> Mr.<br> Kirk.<br> You are uncommon workmen.<br> That basement looks like it's been scrubbed and polished.<br> Then we can do other work? Yes.<br> 7:00 in the morning.<br> Do you have a flop for the night? A what? You really are new at this, aren't you? That's a place to sleep.<br> Oh.<br> There's a vacant room where I live for $2.<br>00 a week.<br> I could take you there.<br> Thank you.<br> Good.<br> We have a flop.<br> We have a what, Captain? A place to sleep.<br> One might have said so in the first place.<br> Captain, I must have some platinum.<br> A small block would be sufficient -- By passing certain circuits through there to be used as a duodynetic field core -- Mr.<br> Spock, I've brought you some assorted vegetables, baloney and rolls for myself, and I've spent the other 9/10 of our combined salaries for the last three days on filling this order for you.<br> This bag doesn't contain platinum, silver, or gold, nor is it likely to in the near future.<br> Captain, you're asking me to use equipment which isn't far ahead of stone knives and bearskins.<br> McCoy will be along in a few days, perhaps sooner.<br> There's no guarantee that these currents in time will bring us together.<br> This has to work.<br> Captain Captain, in three weeks, at this rate, possibly a month, I might reach the first mnemonic memory circuits.<br> [Knock On Door] Your cap.<br> If you can leave immediately, I can get you 5 hours' work at 22 cents an hour.<br> What -- What on Earth is that? I am endeavoring, ma'am, to construct a mnemonic memory circuit using stone knives and bearskins.<br> Captain.<br> Tools for finely detailed work.<br> That toolbox was locked with a combination lock, and you opened it like a real pro.<br> Why did you do it? I needed the fine tools for my radio work.<br> They'd have been returned in the morning.<br> I can't -- If Mr.<br> Spock says the tools would be returned tomorrow morning, you can bet your reputation on that, Miss Keeler.<br> On one condition walk me home? I still have a few questions I'd like to ask about you two.<br> Oh, and don't give me that ''questions about little old us?'' look.<br> You know how out of place you are around here.<br> Interesting.<br> Where would you estimate we belong, Miss Keeler? You? At his side, as if you've always been there and always will.<br> And you you belong in another place.<br> I don't know where or how.<br> I'll figure it out eventually.<br> I'll finish with the furnace.<br> \"Captain\"? Even when he doesn't say it, he does.<br> 'Goodnight, sweetheart' 'Though I'm not beside you' 'Goodnight, sweetheart' 'Still my love will guide you'' Why does Spock call you \"Captain\"? Were you in the war together? We served together.<br> And you don't want to talk about it? Why? I -- Did you do something wrong? Are you afraid of something? Whatever it is, let me help.<br> \"Let me help.<br>\" A hundred years or so from now, a novelist will write a classic using that theme.<br> He'll recommend those three words even over \"I love you.<br>\" Centuries from now? Who is he? Where does he come -- Where will he come from? Silly question.<br> Want to hear a silly answer? Yes.<br> A planet circling that far left star in Orion's belt.<br> See? How are the stone knives and bearskins? I may have found our focal point in time.<br> You may also find you have a connection burning.<br> Yes.<br> I'm overloading those lines.<br> I believe we'll have our answer on this screen.<br> Good.<br> And, Captain you may find this a bit distressing.<br> Let's see what you have.<br> I've slowed down the recording we made from the time vortex.<br> \"February 23, 1 936.<br>\" Six years from now.<br> \"The president and Edith Keeler conferred for some time today -- \" [Bzzzt] How bad? Bad enough.<br> The president and Edith Keeler.<br> It would seem unlikely, Jim.<br> A few moments ago, I read a 1930 newspaper article.<br> We know her future.<br> Within six years from now, she'll become very important, nationally famous.<br> Or, Captain, Edith Keeler will die this year.<br> I saw her obituary.<br> Some sort of traffic accident.<br> You must be mistaken.<br> They both can't be true.<br> Edith Keeler is the focal point in time we've been looking for, the point that both we and Dr.<br> McCoy have been drawn to.<br> She has two possible futures then, and, depending on whether she lives or dies, all of history will be changed.<br> And McCoy Is the random element.<br> What does he do? Does he kill her? Or perhaps he prevents her from being killed.<br> We don't know which.<br> Get this thing fixed.<br> We must find out before McCoy arrives.<br> Captain suppose we discover that, in order to set things straight again, Edith Keeler must die? Assassins! Murderers! Murderers! Assassins! You! What planet is this? No! Don't run! I won't kill you! It's they who do the killing! Don't run! I won't kill you! Why? What is so funny about man reaching for the moon? How do you know? I just know, that's all.<br> I -- I feel it.<br> And more -- I think that one day, they'll take all the money they spend on war -- And make them spend it on life? Yes.<br> You see the same things that I do.<br> We speak the same language.<br> The very same.<br> No! I -- I'm glad you got away, too.<br> Yeah, I -- I -- Why do you think they want to kill us? Look, you take too much of that old wood alky, and -- Where Where are we? Earth? The constellations seem right, but -- Explain! Explain this trick.<br> I -- I Biped  small  good cranial development.<br> No doubt, considerable human ancestry.<br> Is that how you're able to fake all of this? Very good.<br> Modern museum perfection right down to the cement beams.<br> Very, very good.<br> Oh, I'd give a lot to see the hospital.<br> Probably needles and sutures.<br> All the pain.<br> They used to hand-cut and sew people like garments.<br> Needles and sutures all the terrible pain! \"\" [Pitch Increases] How long before we get a full answer? I'll need two more days before I dare make another attempt.<br> McCoy could have been in the city a week now for all we know, and whatever he does that affects her and changes history could happen tonight, tomorrow morning.<br> Captain our last bit of information was obtained at the expense of 30 hours' work and fused and burned circuits.<br> I must know whether she lives or dies, Spock.<br> I must know what to do.<br> Extra! Extra! Get your morning paper! Get your paper, read all about it! Oh, miss that coffee, it just smells wonderful.<br> You look terrible! You better sit down.<br> Come on.<br> I can't.<br> I got to keep moving.<br> I can't let them find me.<br> There's a cot in the back room.<br> They won't find you there.<br> Come on.<br> This is how history went after McCoy changed it.<br> Here the late 1930s -- a growing pacifist movement whose influence delayed the United States' entry into the Second World War.<br> While peace negotiations dragged on, Germany had time to complete its heavy-water experiments.<br> Germany -- fascism, Hitler.<br> Sieg heil! Sieg heil! They won the Second World War because all this lets them develop the A-bomb first.<br> There's no mistake, Captain.<br> Let me run it again.<br> Edith Keeler, founder of the peace movement.<br> But she was right.<br> Peace was the way.<br> She was right, but at the wrong time.<br> With the A-bomb, and with their V-2 rockets to carry them, Germany captured the world.<br> No.<br> And all this because McCoy came back and somehow kept her from dying in a street accident, as she was meant to.<br> We must stop him, Jim.<br> How did she die? What day? I can estimate general happenings from these images, but I can't trace down precise actions at exact moments, Captain.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Spock  I believe  I'm in love with Edith Keeler.<br> Jim, Edith Keeler must die.<br> Hey, now, come on.<br> You're not ready to take on any tigers just yet.<br> Lie down.<br> The most common question to ask would be, where am I? I don't think I'll ask it.<br> Why not? The only possible answer would conclusively prove that I'm  either unconscious or demented.<br> This looks like old Earth around 1920 or '25.<br> Would you care to try for '30? I am unconscious  or demented.<br> I have a friend that talks about Earth like you do.<br> Would you like to meet him? I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist.<br> I am Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer aboard the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> I don't mean to disbelieve you, but that's hardly a navy uniform.<br> It's quite all right.<br> It's quite all right, dear  because I don't believe in you, either.<br> Get some rest.<br> Edith.<br> Are you following me, sir? With ulterior motives.<br> Does that please you? I hope it means what -- Oh! How stupid! I've been up and down those stairs a thousand times.<br> I could have broken my neck.<br> Captain, I did not plan to eavesdrop.<br> No, of course you didn't.<br> I must point out that when she stumbled she might have died right there, had you not caught her.<br> It's not yet time.<br> McCoy isn't here.<br> We're not that sure of our facts.<br> Who's to say when the exact time will come? Save her -- do as your heart tells you to do -- and millions will die who did not die before.<br> [Knock On Door] Come in.<br> Well, you look just fine, Doctor.<br> Thank you.<br> I thought you might like to see the evening paper.<br> No, not particularly.<br> You know, I've convinced myself that this is all in a cordrazine hallucination, but I've decided you're not.<br> That's reassuring.<br> But if you're not, what are you? A friend.<br> When you showed up here, you looked like you could use one.<br> I don't doubt it.<br> What about this place? You run it? I try to.<br> Why? It's necessary.<br> Well, it was for me, at least.<br> You may have saved my life.<br> Lots of people drink from the wrong bottle sometimes.<br> Not as wrong as the bottle I drank from.<br> Allow me to show my gratitude.<br> Perhaps there's something I can do around here to thank you.<br> We can talk about that later.<br> I have to go.<br> My young man is taking me to a Clark Gable movie.<br> A who movie? A Clark Gab-- Don't you know? Well, I know what a movie is, but That's very strange.<br> You get some rest.<br> I'll see you later.<br> [Horn Honks] [Honk Honk] If we hurry, maybe we can catch the Clark Gable movie at the Orpheum.<br> What? Dr.<br> McCoy said the same thing.<br> McCoy! Leonard McCoy? Well yes.<br> He's in the mission.<br> He's -- Stay right here.<br> Spock! Stay right there! What is it? McCoy! He's -- - Jim! - Bones! No, Jim! [Tires Screech] Aah! You deliberately stopped me, Jim.<br> I could have saved her.<br> Do you know what you just did? He knows, Doctor.<br> He knows.<br> What happened, sir? You only left a moment ago.<br> We were successful.<br> Time has resumed its shape.<br> All is as it was before.<br> Many such journeys are possible.<br> Let me be your gateway.<br> Captain, the Enterprise is asking if we want to beam up.<br> Let's get the hell out of here.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

There's no medical or scientific cause for what happened on those planets.<br> But it follows a definite pattern -- a systematic progression from planet to planet.<br> Captain, we're picking up a ship on our sensors, heading directly into the Denevan sun.<br> Plot an interception course, warp factor 8.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact that ship.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Ship is a one-man vessel of Denevan configuration, Captain.<br> He does not seem to be out of control.<br> His course is straight for the sun.<br> Scotty, tractor beams?

We don't want to hurt you.<br> Stand by to fire.<br> Fire.<br> Did you hear what they said?

Ohh.<br> Sam.<br> It is my brother.<br> Was my brother.<br> I'm sorry, Jim.<br> The boy's unconscious, but he's still alive.<br> Peter.<br> I better get the boy and the mother back to the ship.<br> I can't do much for them down here.<br> Get ready to beam up.<br> Calling Enterprise.<br> Prepare to beam up party of four.<br> Captain, I understand how you must -- Yes.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You heard my sister-in-law say something about they being here.<br> Your guess.<br> Notice the ventilator, Captain.<br> Apparently they were trying to keep something outside from getting in.<br> Obviously they were not entirely successful.<br> It doesn't make sense.<br> No harmful life forms were reported.<br> Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong here.<br> That is correct.<br> I am at a loss to understand it.<br> Ready to beam up.<br> I'd like you to be onboard when your sister-in-law regains consciousness.<br> Take charge of the landing party, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I want some answers to all this.<br> I won't be able to give you the exact cause until I get the plates back from the lab.<br> They're both in extreme pain.<br> I sedated them heavily.<br> Your sister-in-law has a high tolerance.<br> The tranquilizer hasn't affected her much.<br> Can she talk?

Things.<br> Horrible things! Visitors brought them in their vessel from another planet.<br> Ingraham B.<br> What kind of things? Not the ship's crew's fault.<br> The things made them bring their ship here.<br> Aurelan it's important that you tell us  What kind of things? Not their fault.<br> [Sobbing Loudly] When she answers questions, any questions, it's as if she's fighting to get the answers out, as though something is exerting pain to stop her.<br> They use it to control us.<br> They're spreading, Jim.<br> They need us to be their arms and legs.<br> They're forcing us to build ships for them.<br> Don't let them! Don't let them go any further! Aah! My brother's son? I'll do everything I can, Jim, to save him.<br> Report.<br> The streets are extraordinarily quiet.<br> We've seen no other Denevans, and the ones we stunned earlier were gone when we came out.<br> You've seen some kind of creature.<br> Any alien form? None, sir.<br> Just that noise we heard.<br> Peculiar buzzing sound.<br> We were about to investigate it.<br> All right.<br> Let's go find out what it is.<br> Set your phasers on force three.<br> To kill.<br> We're looking for some kind of creature, and we already know it will kill.<br> [Buzzing] [Squeak] [Buzzing Continues] [Squeak] Spock! [Squeak] Stay low.<br> Fire! Incredible.<br> Not only should it have been destroyed by our phasers, it doesn't register on my tricorder.<br> Captain, it doesn't even look real.<br> It's not life as we know or understand it.<br> It is obviously alive, it exists And it can bear up under full phaser power.<br> I suggest we risk taking it aboard.<br> It may be a trap in here.<br> Let's move out.<br> Let's move out.<br> Spock! Spock! It's gone.<br> Can you stand? Spock, are you all right? Captain 's log supplemental.<br> Whatever the creatures are, they have apparently taken over all the inhabitants of Deneva.<br> Meanwhile, ship 's surgeon Dr.<br> McCoy is examining a strange puncture wound left by one of the creatures on Mr.<br> Spock's back.<br> Nurse.<br> That's the second time he's come out of it.<br> Either he's fighting us, or something inside of him is fighting us.<br> The readings have never looked like that before, not even on Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Let's prepare to close.<br> Nurse! Doctor, that's not all you're going to do.<br> Miss Chapel.<br> Doctor, there is more of it in him, entwined all through his body.<br> If you cannot assist me as required, call another nurse in here.<br> But do one or the other now.<br> How is he? To be very frank, Jim, I don't know that I can do anything for Spock or your nephew.<br> They're pieces of some form of living tissue.<br> I removed one from Spock's spinal cord, the other from your sister-in-law's body.<br> They're both the same.<br> The boy's too weak to touch.<br> Besides, removal of the tissue wouldn't stop the pain anyhow.<br> Did you operate on Spock in time? No.<br> I just removed these for examination.<br> His body's full of these tentacles, entwining and growing all about his nervous system.<br> My nephew? The same.<br> Evidently, when the creature attacks, it leaves a stinger much like a bee or wasp, leaving one of these in the victim's body.<br> It takes over the victim very rapidly, and the entwining is far, far too involved for conventional surgery to remove.<br> Recommendations? I'm sorry, Jim.<br> The lab, the science departments  We're all stumped.<br> No! No! Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No, I won't.<br> Mr.<br> Spock -- Oh! Bridge, this is sick bay.<br> Tell Dr.<br> McCoy Mr.<br> Spock just left here.<br> He's delirious and possibly dangerous.<br> All decks, security alert.<br> Locate and restrain Mr.<br> Spock.<br> He may be dangerous.<br> Use phasers on stun if necessary.<br> Must take the ship -- Down! I must  Take it down.<br> Get him back to the sick bay.<br> Use security restraints.<br> The K-3 indicator registers the level of pain.<br> Watch as I turn it on.<br> That's what he's been going through.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> No wonder the poor devils go mad.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Captain.<br> Spock.<br> These restraints will no longer be necessary.<br> Nor will your sedatives, Doctor.<br> I'll be able to return to duty.<br> I apologize for my weakness earlier when I tried to take control of the ship.<br> I simply did not understand.<br> What is there to understand, Mr.<br> Spock? I am a Vulcan, Doctor.<br> Pain is a thing of the mind.<br> The mind can be controlled.<br> You're only half Vulcan.<br> What about the human half? It is proving to be an inconvenience, but it is manageable.<br> The creature, with all of its thousands of parts, even now is pressuring me.<br> It wants this ship, but I am resisting.<br> Can he control it the way he says, Bones? Who knows, Jim? I know the amount of pain the creature can inflict upon him, but whether he can control it hour to hour  I have my own will, Captain.<br> Let me help.<br> I need you, Spock  but we can't take any chances.<br> We'll keep you  confined for a while longer.<br> If you can maintain control, we'll see.<br> Uhh  My nephew.<br> If he regains consciousness, will he go through that? Yes.<br> Help them.<br> I don't care what it takes or costs.<br> You've got to help them.<br> Jim, aren't you forgetting something? There are over a million colonists on that planet down there Just as much your responsibility.<br> They need your help, too.<br> I am a Vulcan.<br> I am a Vulcan.<br> There is no pain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I thought you were still confined to sick bay.<br> I was.<br> Here, now.<br> Where do you think you're going? I have an errand on the planet's surface.<br> You'll beam me down to the same coordinates as before.<br> Not likely, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is an order, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, sir.<br> I'm sorry I have to disobey it.<br> The captain said no one was to transport down.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Freeze right there, Mr.<br> Spock, or I'll put you to sleep for sure.<br> This is Mr.<br> Scott in the transporter room.<br> Get me the captain.<br> I ordered you to stay in sick bay.<br> Until the pain was gone, Captain.<br> It has been discontinued by me.<br> Scotty? He said he was transporting to the surface.<br> Your orders were no one was to beam down unless you authorized it.<br> And knowing Mr.<br> Spock's determination on some things, I thought I'd hold him until I got your orders.<br> One of the creatures will have to be captured and analyzed.<br> We did not have a clear opportunity earlier when I was attacked.<br> Since my nervous system is already affected, as you pointed out, Doctor, I don't believe they can do much more to me.<br> Jim, this is ridiculous.<br> I don't want my patients running around.<br> He should be in bed.<br> I am in complete control of myself, Doctor.<br> The fact that I am here proves that I do not belong in bed.<br> Mr.<br> Spock  your logic, as usual, is inescapable.<br> Beam him down.<br> Stay in constant touch with us.<br> Give him your phaser.<br> He'll need that, too.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> Energize.<br> Jim, that man is sick.<br> Don't give me any damnable logic about him being the only man for the job.<br> I don't have to, Bones.<br> We both know he is.<br> [Buzzing] [Squeak Squeak] Come in, gentlemen.<br> I believe you'll find this interesting.<br> Doctor, your medical skill and curiosity are quite admirable, but I assure you I'm all right.<br> You may be controlling the pain, Mr.<br> Spock, but you're far from all right.<br> Unimportant at the moment, Doctor.<br> Please observe.<br> Interesting, gentlemen.<br> A one-celled creature resembling, more than anything else, a huge, individual brain cell.<br> Yes.<br> That would answer a lot of questions.<br> Do you understand what I'm suggesting? I think so.<br> This may be one cell in a larger organism, an incredibly huge organism, in fact.<br> And although it's not physically connected to the other cells, it is, nevertheless, part of the whole creature, guided by the whole, drawing its strength from the whole, which probably accounts for its unusual resistance to our phaser weapons.<br> Existing so differently from any living matter or energy as we know it, that it may have come here planet by planet from an entirely different galaxy.<br> From a place where our physical laws do not apply.<br> We may therefore find it difficult to destroy, Captain.<br> But not impossible, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The Denevan that flew into the sun cried out that he was free, that he'd won.<br> That's the angle to work on.<br> I want an analysis of all this from Medical and Life Science departments within the hour.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I'm sorry, Captain.<br> I've tried everything I can.<br> Variant radiation, intense heat as great as 9,000 degrees.<br> Then you're wasting your time.<br> There has to be something that'll kill the creature without destroying the human host.<br> Which is my point.<br> The thing won't die, even at temperatures and radiation which would burn Spock and your nephew to ashes.<br> I can't accept that, Bones.<br> We've got 14 science labs aboard this ship.<br> The finest equipment and computers in the galaxy.<br> Captain  I understand your concern -- your affection for Spock, the fact that your nephew is the last survivor of your brother's family.<br> No, no, Bones.<br> There's more than two lives at stake here.<br> I cannot let it spread beyond this colony, even if it means destroying a million people down there.<br> Captain 's Log.<br> Star date 3289.<br>8.<br> I am faced with the most difficult decision of my life.<br> Unless we find a way to destroy the creatures without killing their human hosts, my command responsibilities will force me to kill over a million people.<br> Gentlemen.<br> I regret I see no other choice, Captain.<br> We already know this thing has destroyed three civilizations.<br> Perhaps more.<br> I want it stopped, too, but not at the cost of destroying a million people.<br> Including myself, Doctor, and Captain Kirk's young nephew.<br> Understandably upsetting, but once it spreads past here, there are dozens of colonies beyond and billions of people.<br> If killing 5 people saves 10, it's a bargain.<br> Is that your simple logic? I will accept neither of those alternatives, gentlemen.<br> I cannot let this thing expand beyond this planet, nor do I intend to kill a million people to stop it.<br> I want another answer.<br> I'm putting you gentlemen on the hot seat with me.<br> I want that third alternative.<br> Report.<br> Sorry, Jim.<br> We've been over and over it, made every conceivable test.<br> I therefore request permission to beam down to the planet's surface and that your nephew accompany me.<br> Request denied.<br> Captain  I do not make this request lightly.<br> I do not know how much longer I can hold out against the pain.<br> But I do know what the boy will go through should he regain consciousness.<br> Request denied.<br> There must be another answer.<br> Something  in the sun  killed that thing before the Denevan died.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> We've tried heat, radiation.<br> What other qualities or properties does the sun have? It exists physically.<br> It occupies space, it has mass, therefore, gravity.<br> It converts matter to energy.<br> [Pulsing] Jim, we've been through it and through it.<br> Radiation, heat  But one other thing you haven't mentioned.<br> It's bright.<br> It radiates a blinding light if you're close enough.<br> Nothing lethal about light.<br> Not to us.<br> But down on the surface, the creatures stayed in the shadows for the most part.<br> Suppose  they weren't simply hiding.<br> Suppose they're sensitive to light, light, like in a sun close up.<br> A possibility.<br> You can't move Deneva closer to the sun, Jim.<br> But you can move the sun's equivalent to Deneva! Mr.<br> Spock? Yes.<br> In essence it can be done -- a string of satellites around the planet with burning trimagnesite and tritium.<br> [Sigh] Well, I can rig a test cubicle in a bio lab, put our specimen in it.<br> But I don't -- Good.<br> Let's get on it.<br> Your figures are, of course, accurate.<br> Of course.<br> The light of the sun at the proximity where the Denevan declared himself free was 1 million candles per square inch.<br> If this works, the satellites we orbit will produce light of such intensity that even someone in a closed, darkened area will be affected by it.<br> Ready, Doctor.<br> Put on your masks.<br> Completed.<br> It worked! We can do it.<br> What's the matter, Jim? We can do it! It worked.<br> In a lab.<br> With the creature exposed to everything we can give it.<br> But what about the people who are infected? Well, I don't know.<br> Maybe trial -- There's no time for maybes, Bones.<br> We need to know now.<br> But I'd have to put a -- Yes, we'd have to put someone who's infected under that light.<br> Do you have any idea of the risk? We have to duplicate the conditions on the planet.<br> And Spock  Captain.<br> You'll need a host for the next step in the test to determine whether the creature can be driven from the body.<br> I am the logical choice.<br> Do you know what 1-million candlelight per square inch can do to your optic nerves? There's no other way, Bones.<br> We have to duplicate the brilliance that existed at the moment the Denevan declared himself freed.<br> All right.<br> I'll rig up a protective pair of goggles.<br> There'll be none on the planet's surface, Doctor.<br> I agree completely.<br> Unfortunately, you're both right.<br> It's the only thing we can do.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.<br> Proceed.<br> Completed.<br> Spock, are you all right? The creature within me is gone.<br> I am free of it  and the pain.<br> And I'm also quite blind.<br> An equitable trade, Doctor.<br> Thank you.<br> Doctor, the results of the first tests on the creature's remains  Oh, no.<br> What is it? I threw the total spectrum of light at the creature.<br> It wasn't necessary.<br> I didn't stop to think that only one kind of light might've killed it.<br> Interesting.<br> Just as dogs are sensitive to certain sounds which humans cannot hear, these creatures evidently are sensitive to light we cannot see.<br> Are you telling me  that Spock need not have been blinded? I didn't need to throw the blinding white light at all, Jim.<br> Spock, I  Doctor  it was my selection as well.<br> It is done.<br> Bones.<br> Take care of him.<br> Completing the seeding orbit, Captain.<br> now in position.<br> Permanent orbit about the planet.<br> Good.<br> Scanners? Scanners ready, sir.<br> Very well.<br> Ready, Helm? Ready, Captain.<br> Satellite control, this is the captain.<br> Energize all satellites.<br> Affirmative.<br> All satellites operative, Captain.<br> Captain, receiving messages from our ground station.<br> Report.<br> The things are dying, sir.<br> It's working.<br> Sick bay.<br> McCoy here.<br> Tell Spock  it worked.<br> Yes, Captain.<br> He'll be happy to hear that.<br> Bones  it wasn't your fault.<br> Bones.<br> Bones.<br> Yeoman, record this for Starfleet Command.<br> Ready, sir.<br> The alien creatures on Deneva have been destroyed -- Captain, look.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> [Kirk] Spock.<br> You can see.<br> The blindness was temporary, Jim.<br> Something about his optical nerves which aren't the same as a human's.<br> An hereditary trait, Captain.<br> The brightness of the Vulcan sun has caused the development of an inner eyelid, which acts as a shield against high-intensity light.<br> Totally instinctive, Doctor.<br> We tend to ignore it, as you ignore your own appendix.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Regaining eyesight would be an emotional experience for most.<br> You, I presume, felt nothing? Quite the contrary, Captain.<br> I had a very strong reaction.<br> My first sight was the face of Dr.<br> McCoy bending over me.<br> 'Tis a pity your brief blindness did not increase your appreciation for beauty, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> If you gentlemen are finished, would you lay in a course for Star base 10, Mr.<br> Spock? My pleasure, Captain.<br> Unusual eye arrangement.<br> I might've known he'd turn up with something like that.<br> What? I said, please don't tell Spock I said he was the fleet's best first officer.<br> Why, thank you, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> You've been so concerned about his Vulcan eyes, Doctor.<br> You forgot about his Vulcan ears.<br> Ahead warp factor 1, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Warp factor 1, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain.<br> - Got a minute? - A minute.<br> It's Spock.<br> You noticed anything strange about him? No, nothing in particular.<br> Why? Well, it's nothing I can pinpoint without an examination, but he's become increasingly restive.<br> If he were not a Vulcan, I'd almost say \"nervous.<br>\" For another thing, he's avoiding food.<br> I've checked and he hasn't eaten at all in three days.<br> Well, that just sounds like Mr.<br> Spock in one of his contemplative phases.<br> Miss Chapel.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Captain.<br> What's this? Vulcan plomeek soup.<br> And I'll bet you made it too.<br> You never give up hoping, do you? Mr.<br> Spock hasn't been eating, Doctor.<br> And I just happened to notice.<br> It's all right.<br> Carry on, Miss Chapel.<br> - Bones, I'm a busy man.<br> - Jim, when I suggested to Spock it was time for his routine checkup your logical, unemotional first officer turned to me and said: \"You will cease to pry into my personal matters, Doctor, or I shall certainly break your neck.<br>\" Spock said that? What is this? Poking.<br> Prying.<br> If I want anything from you, I'll ask for it.<br> Captain, I should like to request a leave of absence.<br> On my home planet.<br> On our present course, you can divert to Vulcan with a loss of but 2.<br>8 light-days.<br> - What the devil is this all about? - I've made my request, Captain.<br> All I require from you is that you answer it, yes or no.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> All right, Spock.<br> Let's have it.<br> It is undignified for a woman to play servant to a man who is not hers.<br> I'm more interested in your request for shore leave.<br> - In the years that I've known - You have my request.<br> Will you grant it or not? In all the years I've known you, you've never asked for leave of any sort.<br> In fact, you've refused them.<br> Why now? Captain, surely I have enough leave time accumulated.<br> Agreed.<br> But that isn't the question, is it? If there's a problem of some sort, illness in the family No.<br> Nothing of that nature, Captain.<br> Then since we're headed for Altair VI, and since the shore facilities there are excellent No.<br> I must I wish to take my leave on Vulcan.<br> Spock, I'm asking you.<br> What's wrong? I need rest.<br> I'm asking you to accept that answer.<br> Bridge.<br> - Helm.<br> - Yes, Captain? Alter course to Vulcan.<br> - Increase speed to warp 4.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Thank you, Captain.<br> I suppose most of us overlook the fact that even Vulcans aren't indestructible.<br> No.<br> We're not.<br> Captain's Log, Stardate 3372.<br>7.<br> On course, on schedule, bound for Altair VI via Vulcan.<br> First Officer Spock seems to be under stress.<br> He has requested and been granted shore leave.<br> Ship's Surgeon McCoy has him under medical surveillance.<br> Captain, something's coming in on the Starfleet channel.<br> Priority and urgent, sir.<br> Put it on audio over here, Lieutenant.<br> Message complete, sir.<br> Switching over.<br> To Captain, U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise.<br> From Starfleet, Sector 9.<br> Inauguration ceremonies Altair VI have been advanced seven solar days.<br> You're ordered to alter your flight plan as filed to accommodate.<br> By order of Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command.<br> Acknowledge.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, acknowledge that message.<br> Aye aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, compute course and speed necessary for compliance.<br> We'll have to head directly there at warp 6, sir.<br> Insufficient time to stop off at Vulcan.<br> Head directly for Altair VI.<br> Sailor's luck, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Or, as one of Finagle's Laws puts it: \"Any home port the ship makes will be somebody else's, not mine.<br>\" The new President of Altair VI wants to get himself launched a week early, so we have to be there a week early.<br> Don't worry, I'll see that you get your leave, as soon as we're finished.<br> I quite understand, Captain.<br> - Bridge, Navigation.<br> - Navigation, Chekov here.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, how late will we arrive for the ceremonies if we increase speed to maximum and divert to Vulcan just long enough to drop off Mr.<br> Spock? I do not understand, Captain.<br> How far behind schedule will diverting to Vulcan put us? We're on course for Vulcan, Captain, as Mr.<br> Spock ordered.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Come with me, please.<br> Deck 5.<br> You changed course for Vulcan, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Why? Changed the course? Do you deny it? No.<br> By no means, Captain.<br> It is quite possible.<br> - Then why did you do it? - Captain, I accept, on your word that I did it.<br> But I do not know why, nor do I remember doing it.<br> Captain, lock me away.<br> I do not wish to be seen.<br> I cannot.<br> No Vulcan could explain further.<br> I'm trying to help you, Spock.<br> Ask me no further questions.<br> I will not answer.<br> - I order you to report to the Sickbay.<br> - Sickbay? Complete examination.<br> McCoy's waiting.<br> Come in, Spock.<br> I'm all ready for you.<br> My orders were to report to Sickbay, Doctor.<br> I have done so.<br> And now I'll go to my quarters.<br> My orders were to give you a thorough physical.<br> In case you hadn't noticed, I have to answer to the same commanding officer that you do.<br> Come on, Spock.<br> Yield to the logic of the situation.<br> Very well.<br> Examine me, for all the good it will do either of us.<br> How do you figure it, Chekov? First we're going to Vulcan.<br> Then we're going to Altair.<br> Then we're headed to Vulcan again.<br> Now we're headed back to Altair.<br> I think I'm going to get space-sick.<br> Jim, you've got to get Spock to Vulcan.<br> Bones, I will, I will.<br> As soon as this mission is completed.<br> No, now.<br> Right away.<br> If you don't get him to Vulcan within a week, eight days at the outside, he'll die.<br> He'll die, Jim.<br> Why must he die? Why within eight days? Explain.<br> I don't know.<br> You keep saying that.<br> Are you a doctor or aren't you? There's a growing imbalance of body functions.<br> As if in our bodies, huge amounts of adrenaline were constantly being pumped into our bloodstreams.<br> Now, I can't trace it down in my bio-comps.<br> Spock won't tell me what it is.<br> But if it isn't stopped somehow, the physical and emotional pressures will simply kill him.<br> You say you're convinced he knows what it is? He does.<br> And he's as tightlipped about it as an Aldebaran shellmouth.<br> No use to ask him, Jim.<br> He won't talk.<br> Come.<br> Stay.<br> McCoy has given me his medical evaluation of your condition.<br> He says you're going to die unless something is done.<br> What? Is it something only your planet can do for you? Spock.<br> You've been called the best first officer in the Fleet.<br> That's an enormous asset to me.<br> If I have to lose that first officer, I want to know why.<br> It's a thing no outworlder may know except those very few who've been involved.<br> A Vulcan understands, but even we do not speak of it among ourselves.<br> It is a deeply personal thing.<br> Can you see that, Captain, and understand? No, I do not understand.<br> Explain.<br> Consider that an order.<br> There are some things which transcend even the discipline of the service.<br> Would it help if I told you that I'll treat this as totally confidential? It has to do with biology.<br> - What? - Biology.<br> - What kind of biology? - Vulcan biology.<br> You mean, the biology of Vulcans? Biology as in reproduction? Well there's no need to be embarrassed about it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It happens to the birds and bees.<br> The birds and the bees are not Vulcans, Captain.<br> If they were, if any creature as proudly logical as us, were to have their logic ripped from them as this time does to us How do Vulcans choose their mates? Haven't you wondered? I guess the rest of us assume that it's done quite logically.<br> No.<br> It is not.<br> We shield it with ritual and customs shrouded in antiquity.<br> You humans have no conception.<br> It strips our minds from us.<br> It brings a madness which rips away our veneer of civilisation.<br> It is the Pon farr.<br> The time of mating.<br> There are precedents in nature, Captain.<br> The giant eel-birds of Regulus V, once each 11 years they must return to the caverns where they hatched.<br> On your Earth, salmon.<br> They must return to that one stream where they were born to spawn.<br> Or die in trying.<br> But you're not a fish, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You're No, nor am I a man.<br> I'm a Vulcan.<br> I had hoped I would be spared this but the ancient drives are too strong.<br> Eventually they catch up with us.<br> And we are driven by forces we cannot control to return home and take a wife or die.<br> I haven't heard a word you've said.<br> And I'll get you to Vulcan.<br> Somehow.<br> Lieutenant, get me Admiral Komack at Starfleet Command, Sector 9.<br> Pipe it down to McCoy's office.<br> Starfleet Command.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, you don't think Maybe you ought to plot a course back to Vulcan, just in case.<br> Communication to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Lieutenant Uhura here.<br> Captain asked me to inform you he is Let me alone! Captain, you're making a most unusual request.<br> I'm aware of that, sir.<br> But it's of the utmost importance.<br> You must give me permission to divert to Vulcan.<br> But you refuse to explain why it is so important.<br> I can't, sir.<br> But believe me, I wouldn't make such a request The Altair VI is no ordinary matter.<br> That area is just putting itself together after a long interplanetary conflict.<br> This inauguration will stabilise the entire Altair system.<br> Our appearance there is a demonstration of friendship and strength which will cause ripples clear to the Klingon Empire.<br> Sir the delay would be at most a day.<br> I can hardly believe Kirk, you will proceed to Altair VI as ordered.<br> The subject is closed.<br> You have your orders.<br> Starfleet out.<br> - Well, that's that.<br> - No, it's not.<br> I know the Altair situation.<br> We would be one of three starships.<br> Very impressive, very diplomatic.<br> It's simply not that vital.<br> You can't go off to Vulcan against Starfleet orders.<br> You'll be busted I can't let Spock die, can I, Bones? And he will if we go to Altair.<br> I owe him my life a dozen times over.<br> Isn't that worth a career? He's my friend.<br> - Bridge.<br> Navigation.<br> - Bridge.<br> Navigation.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov lay in a course for Vulcan.<br> Tell Engineering I want warp 8 or better.<br> Push her for all she'll take.<br> Course already plotted.<br> Laying it in, sir.<br> I see.<br> Very well.<br> Carry on, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Kirk out.<br> Miss Chapel? Yes, Mr.<br> Spock? I had a most startling dream.<br> You were trying to tell me something but I couldn't hear you.<br> It would be illogical for us to protest against our natures don't you think? I don't understand.<br> Your face is wet.<br> I came to tell you that we are bound for Vulcan.<br> We'll be there in just a few days.<br> Vulcan.<br> - Miss Chapel.<br> - My name is Christine.<br> Yes, I know, Christine.<br> Would you make me some of that plomeek soup? Oh, I'd be very glad to do that, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Bridge.<br> It's obvious that you've surmised my problem, Doctor, and my compliments on your insight.<br> Captain, there is a thing that happens to Vulcans at this time, almost an insanity, which you would no doubt find distasteful.<br> Will I? You've been most patient with my kinds of madness.<br> Then would you beam down to the planet surface and stand with me? There is a brief ceremony.<br> - Is it permitted? - It is my right.<br> By tradition, the male is accompanied by his closest friends.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I also request McCoy accompany me.<br> I shall be honoured, sir.<br> Captain we're standing by on Vulcan hailing frequencies, sir.<br> Open channel, Lieutenant.<br> Vulcan Space Central, this is the U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise requesting permission to assume standard orbit.<br> U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise from Vulcan Space Central, permission granted.<br> And from all of Vulcan, welcome.<br> - Is Commander Spock with you? - This is Spock.<br> Stand by to activate your central viewer, please.<br> Doctor, what's going on? Spock.<br> It is I.<br> T'Pring.<br> Parted from me and never parted.<br> Never and always touching and touched.<br> We meet at the appointed place.<br> Spock.<br> Parted from me and never parted.<br> Never and always touching and touched.<br> I await you.<br> - She's lovely, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Who is she? - She is T'Pring my wife.<br> This is the land of my family.<br> It has been held by us for more than 2000 Earth years.<br> This is our place of Koon-ut-kal-if-fee.<br> He called it Koon-ut what? He described it to me as meaning \"marriage or challenge.<br>\" In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates.<br> And they still go mad at this time.<br> Perhaps the price they pay for having no emotions the rest of the time.<br> Lovely.<br> I wish the breeze were cooler.<br> Yeah.<br> \"Hot as Vulcan.<br>\" Now I understand what that phrase means.<br> The atmosphere is thinner than Earth.<br> I wonder when his T'Pring arrives? The marriage party approaches.<br> I hear them.<br> Marriage party? You said T'Pring was your wife.<br> By our parents' arrangement.<br> A ceremony while we were but 7 years of age.<br> Less than a marriage, but more than a betrothal.<br> One touches the other in order to feel each other's thoughts.<br> In this way, our minds were locked together.<br> So that at the proper time we would both be drawn to  Koon-ut-kal-if-fee.<br> Bones, do you know who that is? T'Pau.<br> The only person to ever turn down a seat in the Federation Council.<br> T'Pau? Officiating at Spock's wedding? He never mentioned that his family was this important.<br> Spock are our ceremonies for outworlders? They are not outworlders.<br> They are my friends.<br> I am permitted this.<br> This is Kirk.<br> Ma'am.<br> - And thee are called? - Leonard McCoy, ma'am.<br> Thee names these outworlders \"friends.<br>\" How does thee pledge their behaviour? With my life, T'Pau.<br> What thee are about to see comes down from the time of the beginning without change.<br> This is the Vulcan heart.<br> This is the Vulcan soul.<br> This is our way.<br> - What is it? What happened? - She chooses the challenge.<br> With him? He acts only if cowardice is seen.<br> She will choose her champion.<br> Spock? Do not attempt to speak with him, Kirk.<br> He is deep in the plak tow, the blood fever.<br> He will not speak with thee again until he has passed through what is to come.<br> If thee wishes to depart thee may leave now.<br> We'll stay.<br> Spock chose his friends well.<br> Ma'am, I don't understand.<br> Are you trying to say that she rejected him.<br> That she doesn't want him? He will have to fight for her.<br> It is her right.<br> T'Pring, thee has chosen the kal-if-fee the challenge.<br> Thee are prepared to become the property of the victor? I am prepared.<br> Spock.<br> Does thee accept challenge, according to our laws and customs? You think Spock can take him? I doubt it.<br> Not in his present condition.<br> T'Pring, thee will choose thy champion.<br> As it was in the dawn of our days, as it is today as it will be for all tomorrows, I make my choice.<br> This one.<br> No.<br> I am to be the one.<br> - It was agreed.<br> - Be silent.<br> Hear me.<br> I have made the ancient claim.<br> I claim the right.<br> The woman is I ask forgiveness.<br> Kirk T'Pring is within her rights, but our laws and customs are not binding on thee.<br> Thee are free to decline with no harm on thyself.<br> T'Pau.<br> Thee speaks? My friend does not understand.<br> The choice has been made, Spock.<br> It is up to him now.<br> He does not know.<br> I will do what I must, T'Pau.<br> But not with him.<br> His blood does not burn.<br> He is my friend.<br> It is said thy Vulcan blood is thin.<br> Are thee Vulcan or are thee human? I burn, T'Pau.<br> My eyes are flame.<br> My heart is flame.<br> Thee has the power, T'Pau.<br> In the name of my fathers, forbid.<br> T'Pau.<br> I plead with thee.<br> I beg.<br> Thee has prided thyself on thy Vulcan heritage.<br> It is decided.<br> - What happens to Spock if I decline? - Another champion will be selected.<br> Do not interfere, Kirk.<br> Keep thy place.<br> You can't do it, Jim.<br> - I can't? - No.<br> She said that their laws and customs were not binding on you.<br> And you said Spock might not be able to handle him.<br> Now, if I can knock Spock out without really hurting him.<br> In this climate? If the heat doesn't get you, the thin air will.<br> You can't do it.<br> If I get into any trouble, I'll quit.<br> And Spock wins, and honour is satisfied.<br> - Jim, listen, if you - Bones.<br> He's my first officer and my friend.<br> I disregarded Starfleet orders to bring him here.<br> Another thing, that's T'Pau, a Vulcan.<br> All of Vulcan in one package.<br> How can I back out in front of her? It is done.<br> Kirk, decide.<br> I accept the challenge.<br> Here begins the act of combat for possession of the woman T'Pring.<br> As it was at the time of the beginning, so it is now.<br> Bring forth the lirpa.<br> If both survive the lirpa combat will continue with the ahn'woon.<br> What do you mean, \"if both survive\"? This combat is to the death.<br> Now, wait a minute, ma'am.<br> Who said anything about a fight to the death? These men are friends.<br> To force them to fight till one of them is killed I can forgive such a display only once.<br> Challenge was given and lawfully accepted.<br> It has begun.<br> Let no one interfere.<br> Spock, no! Is this Vulcan chivalry? The air is too hot and thin for Kirk.<br> He's not used to it.<br> The air is the air.<br> What can be done? I can compensate for the atmosphere and the temperature with this.<br> At least it will give Kirk a fighting chance.<br> Thee may proceed.<br> You're going to have to kill him, Jim.<br> Kill Spock? That's not what we came to Vulcan for, is it? What's that?

Yes.<br> I'll follow you up in a few minutes.<br> You will instruct Mr.<br> Chekov to plot a course for the nearest star base where I must surrender myself to the authorities.<br> T'Pring.<br> - Explain.<br> - Specify.<br> Why the challenge.<br> And why you chose my captain as your champion.<br> Stonn wanted me, I wanted him.<br> I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me.<br> You have become much known among our people, Spock.<br> Almost a legend.<br> And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to be the consort of a legend.<br> But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee.<br> There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him.<br> If your captain were victor, he would not want me and so I would have Stonn.<br> If you were victor, you would free me because I had dared to challenge and again I would have Stonn.<br> But if you did not free me, it would be the same.<br> For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there.<br> Logical.<br> Flawlessly logical.<br> - I am honoured.<br> - Stonn.<br> She is yours.<br> After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting.<br> It is not logical but it is often true.<br> Spock here.<br> Stand by to beam up.<br> Live long, T'Pau, and prosper.<br> Live long and prosper, Spock.<br> I shall do neither.<br> I have killed my captain and my friend.<br> Energize.<br> Doctor, I shall be resigning my commission immediately, of course.<br> So I would appreciate your making the final arrangements.<br> - Spock, I - Doctor, please, let me finish.<br> There can be no excuse for the crime of which I am guilty.<br> I intend to offer no defence.<br> Furthermore, I will order Mr.<br> Scott to take immediate command of this vessel.<br> - Shouldn't you check with me first? - Captain.<br> Jim! I'm pleased to see you, Captain.<br> You seem uninjured.<br> I am at something of a loss to understand it, however.<br> Blame McCoy.<br> That was no tri-ox compound he shot me with.<br> He slipped in a neural paralyzer.<br> Knocked me out.<br> Simulated death.<br> - Indeed.<br> - Nurse, would you mind, please? Spock, what happened down there? The girl, the wedding? Oh, yes, the girl.<br> Most interesting.<br> It must have been the combat.<br> When I thought I had killed the Captain, I found I'd lost all interest in T'Pring.<br> The madness was gone.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Captain Kirk.<br> Message from Starfleet Command.<br> Top priority.<br> Relay it, Lieutenant.<br> Response to T'Pau's request for diversion of Enterprise to Vulcan hereby approved.<br> Any reasonable delay granted.<br> Komack, Admiral, Starfleet Command.<br> A little late, but I'm glad they're seeing it our way.<br> How about that T'Pau? They couldn't turn her down.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, lay in a course for Altair VI.<br> Leave orbit when ready.<br> Kirk out.<br> There's just one thing, Mr.<br> Spock, you can't tell me when you saw Jim alive, you weren't on the verge of giving an emotional scene that would've brought the house down.<br> Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain.<br> - Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I understand.<br> - Thank you, Captain.<br> Of course, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your reaction was quite logical.<br> Thank you, Doctor.<br> In a pig's eye.<br> Come on, Spock.<br> Let's go mind the store.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Archaeology, anthropology, ancient civilisations? Correct.<br> Well, we're going to need help in all those areas.<br> Come on.<br> My children, long have I waited for this moment.<br> The memories you bring of your lush and beautiful Earth.<br> Green fields and blue skies, the simple shepherds and their flocks.<br> You know of Earth? You've been there? Once I stretched out my hand and Earth trembled, and I breathed upon it and spring returned.<br> You mentioned Agamemnon, Hector, Odysseus.<br> How do you know about them? Search your most distant memories.<br> Those of the thousands of years past, and I am there.<br> Your fathers knew me, and your fathers' fathers.<br> I am Apollo.<br> - And I am the czar of all the Russias.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> I'm sorry, captain.<br> I never met a god before.<br> - And you haven't yet.<br> Readings? - Simple humanoid, captain.<br> Evidently not so simple.<br> Earth mother of the most beautiful of women in the universe.<br> That, at least, has not changed.<br> I am pleased.<br> Yes, my children.<br> Zeus, Athena, Aphrodite, Artemis, a gallant band of travelers.<br> We knew your Earth well All right, we're here at your invitation.<br> Would you mind telling us what you want without all the Olympian generalities? You will not leave this place.<br> Transporter Room.<br> Your transportation device no longer functions.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> I will not permit that device to work either, captain.<br> What is it you want? You will worship me, as your fathers did before you.<br> If you wanna play god and call yourself Apollo, that's your business.<br> - But you're no god to us, mister.<br> - I said, you would worship me.<br> - And you've got a lot to learn.<br> - And so have you! Let the lesson begin.<br> Welcome to Olympus, Captain Kirk.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I can't contact the landing party.<br> All frequencies are jammed.<br> - Try to break through.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Transporter and communications? - Inefficient.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, rig all transmission circuits for maximum power generation.<br> Compute for reversal of polarity of the field around the ship.<br> Working, sir.<br> I want a complete sensor scan of the planet.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Locate all life forms.<br> I wanna know what's going on down there.<br> To coin a phrase, fascinating.<br> Analysis.<br> Lieutenant Palamas, what do you know about Apollo? Apollo, twin brother of Artemis, son of the god Zeus and Leto, a mortal.<br> He was the god of light and purity.<br> He was skilled in the bow and the lyre.<br> And this thing? Obviously, he has some knowledge of Earth.<br> His classical references and the appearance of all this.<br> I think the appearance of all this is for our benefit.<br> Bones? Well, I can't say much until I check out these readings.<br> He looks human, but of course that doesn't mean a thing.<br> Whatever he is, sir, he seems to control a remarkable technology.<br> Power is what he controls.<br> You can't do tricks like that without energy.<br> Fine, but what power? Where is it? Scout around with your tricorders.<br> Find the source of that power.<br> - Bones.<br> - Yeah? Bones, I wonder if 5,000 years ago - You have a theory? - I have an idea.<br> What if he is really Apollo? - What? - Captain? I want from you that which is rightfully mine.<br> Your loyalty, your tribute and your worship.<br> May I ask what you offer in exchange for this worship? Life in paradise, as simple and as pleasureful as it was those thousands of years ago on that beautiful planet so far away.<br> Apollo we're willing to talk, but you'll find we don't bow to every creature who happens to have a bag of tricks.<br> Agamemnon was one such as you.<br> And Hercules.<br> Pride and arrogance.<br> They defied me until they felt my wrath.<br> I would like to point out that we are quite capable of some wrath ourselves.<br> I have 430 people on that ship up there.<br> No, you do not, captain.<br> They are mine.<br> To save, to cherish, or to destroy at my will.<br> But why? What you've said so far makes no sense at all.<br> How like Aphrodite and Athena.<br> The beauty, grace.<br> You seem wise for a woman.<br> - What is your name? - Lieutenant Palamas.<br> I mean your name.<br> Carolyn.<br> Carolyn.<br> Yes.<br> You are beautiful.<br> You would do Aphrodite credit.<br> I will tell you a thousand tales, stories of courage and love.<br> You will know what it is to be a goddess.<br> Leave her alone! You protest? - You risk much.<br> - And so do you.<br> Scotty.<br> Very impressive.<br> How'd you do it? I've grown weary of discussion and argument.<br> Captain, the phasers.<br> All the working parts are fused.<br> None of your toys will function.<br> Yes, you are a beauty.<br> But like Artemis, the bow arm should be bare.<br> Oh, it's beautiful.<br> Yes.<br> - Come.<br> - She's not going with you.<br> He shall learn the discipline of the temple.<br> So shall you all.<br> Come.<br> It's all right, captain.<br> I'll go.<br> Without fear.<br> She is fit indeed.<br> Bones, how is he? Stunned, but coming around.<br> I'm not sure it's wise to let her go off like that.<br> He would have been rather difficult to stop.<br> You saw how capricious he is.<br> Benevolent one minute, angry the next.<br> One wrong move from her and he could kill her.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, I think you'd better continue your investigation.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Well, how do you feel, Scotty? I am tingling all over.<br> - Did he take her with him? - It would seem so.<br> Captain, we've got to stop him.<br> He wants her.<br> - The way he looked at her - Mr.<br> Scott! I understand your concern over her, but she volunteered to go with him.<br> Hopefully, to find out more.<br> She's doing her job.<br> I think it's about time you started doing yours.<br> We've got to find out the source of his power.<br> You've got a tricorder.<br> Use it, if you're able to.<br> - I'm able, sir.<br> - And one more thing.<br> I want no more unauthorized action against Apollo or whatever he is.<br> - That's an order.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Besides, you stiff-necked thistlehead, you could have gotten yourself killed.<br> Aye.<br> - Scotty doesn't believe in gods.<br> - Apollo's no god.<br> But he could have been taken for one, though, once.<br> Say 5,000 years ago, a highly sophisticated group of space travelers landed on Earth around the Mediterranean.<br> Yes.<br> To the simple shepherds and tribesmen of early Greece, creatures like that would have been gods.<br> Especially if they had the power to alter their form at will and command great energy.<br> In fact, they couldn't have been taken for anything else.<br> Ready to reverse polarity, Mr.<br> Sulu? Computed and standing by to generate, sir.<br> Activate all units.<br> No good, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We didn't even faze it.<br> - We're still locked tight.<br> - Cut power, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Lieutenant, we must restore communications with the landing party.<br> Well, I'm working, sir, but I can't do anything with this.<br> Well, I might be able to rig up a subspace bypass circuit.<br> Good, do so.<br> Sensor report, Mr.<br> Kyle.<br> I've located the landing party, sir.<br> But one of them seems separated from the other four.<br> And Apollo? I've just picked up readings for our own people.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, here's something.<br> There seems to be a radiated energy pulsation coming from the planet.<br> - I don't know what it is, sir.<br> - Origin? I can't seem to pinpoint it, sir.<br> I would suggest, Mr.<br> Sulu, that if you cannot find out where the power source is, you should find out where it is not.<br> A simple process of elimination.<br> The whole planet, sir? Yes, sir, the whole planet.<br> It's lovely.<br> I've known other women, Daphne, Cassandra.<br> But none more beautiful than you.<br> - Are you frightened of me? - Frightened? No, I don't think so.<br> Of course, a girl doesn't go walking with a A god? All right.<br> A god every day.<br> What happened to the others? Artemis, Hera? They returned to the cosmos on the wings of the wind.<br> - You mean they died? - No.<br> Not as you understand it.<br> We're immortal, we gods.<br> But the Earth changed.<br> Your fathers changed.<br> They turned away until we were only memories.<br> A god cannot survive as a memory.<br> We need love, admiration, worship, as you need food.<br> You really think you're a god? In a real sense, we were gods.<br> We had the power of life and death.<br> We could have struck out from Olympus and destroyed.<br> We have no wish to destroy.<br> So we came home again.<br> It was an empty place without worshippers.<br> But we had no strength to leave.<br> So we waited, all of us.<br> Through the long years.<br> But you said the others didn't die.<br> Even for a god, there's a point of no return.<br> Hera was first.<br> She stood in front of the temple and spread herself upon the wind.<br> Thinner and thinner, until only the wind remained.<br> But I knew you would come.<br> You striving, bickering, foolishly brave humans.<br> I knew you would come to the stars one day.<br> Of all the gods, I knew and I waited.<br> Waited for you to come and sit by my side.<br> I don't understand.<br> Even 5,000 years ago, the gods took mortals to them to love, to care for.<br> Like Zeus took Leto, my mother.<br> We were gods of passion, of love.<br> There is a repeated occurrence of registrations.<br> A regular pulsating pattern of radiated energy.<br> Unquestionably, an immensely powerful field of energy is being generated around here somewhere, but we're having difficulty focusing on it.<br> Apollo has no difficulty focusing.<br> He taps that energy, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Sir, some creatures can generate and control energy with no harm to themselves.<br> The electric eel on Earth, the giant dry-worm of Antos IV.<br> - The fluffy - Not the whole encyclopaedia, Chekov.<br> The captain requires complete information.<br> Spock's contaminating this boy, Jim.<br> Are you suggesting that he, Apollo, taps the flow of energy and channels it through his body? That would seem most likely, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, I think you've earned your pay for the week.<br> But where is the source of that power? Number one on our list of things to do.<br> Is that all you have to offer? Yes, except my estimation for his physical condition.<br> In spite of Apollo's bag of tricks, he comes up essentially normal with just a few variations.<br> However, there's an extra organ in his chest I can't even make a guess about.<br> - Bones, is it possible.<br>.<br>? - Jim.<br> Where's Lieutenant Palamas? She is no longer of any concern to you.<br> You bloodthirsty Saracen, - what have you done with her? - Scotty! Scotty! Not good.<br> Severe shock.<br> All right, mister.<br> You wanted worshippers? You've got enemies.<br> You want us to bow down You will learn discipline.<br> You will learn Chekov, give me a hand.<br> - Take care of Scotty.<br> - Are you all right, captain? - Where's Apollo? - He disappeared again, like the cat in that Russian story.<br> Don't you mean the English story, the Cheshire cat? - Cheshire? No, sir.<br> Minsk, perhaps - All right.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> Sir, there is something I noticed.<br> Apollo looked very strange when he disappeared.<br> Tired or in pain.<br> I don't know if it means anything.<br> Very good, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> That might very well mean something.<br> - How do you feel? - I can't get my arm to move.<br> Some neural damage.<br> - We've got to get out of here.<br> - How? How? Let's assume that creatures like our friend, Apollo, did indeed visit Earth, and formed the basis of the Greek classic myths.<br> - It makes sense.<br> - Most mythology has its basis in fact.<br> Now, if I remember my ancient legends, the gods, after expending energy, required rest, even as we humans.<br> And Apollo's gone.<br> After attacking you and Mr.<br> Scott.<br> You think maybe he's off somewhere recharging his energy cells? Something like that.<br> Remember, he's keeping a force field on the ship and he's expending energy down here.<br> You said he looked pained and tired when he disappeared.<br> If we can wear him out, overwork him, that might do it.<br> The trouble with overworking him is that it can get us killed.<br> If we can provoke him so that he strikes one of us again, there's a chance that he'll be drained enough, the rest of us can jump him.<br> - I still say it can get us killed.<br> - Not all of us, Bones.<br> When he comes back, it's a chance we'll have to take.<br> Progress report.<br> I'm connecting the bypass circuit now, sir.<br> It should take another half hour.<br> Speed is essential, lieutenant.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I haven't done anything like this in years.<br> If it isn't done just right, I could blow the entire communications system.<br> It's very delicate work, sir.<br> I can think of no one better equipped to handle it, Miss Uhura.<br> - Please proceed.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Right away.<br> Progress, Mr.<br> Sulu? Sectors 1 through 25 charted and examined.<br> No chance at all of power originating in those areas.<br> - Continue the search.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> 14B by 26 index.<br> - Mr.<br> Kyle? - Yes, sir.<br> We're unable to break completely loose from this force field, but we might be able to punch some holes through it.<br> - What for, sir? - To shoot through.<br> It might also relieve Lieutenant Uhura's communications problem.<br> You'll take these equations to the nuclear electronics lab.<br> I want them to work on the problem of negating the force field in selected areas.<br> Now, it might be done by generating a strong pinpoint charge of M-rays on some of these selected wavelengths and tying them in with the combined output of all our engines.<br> Right away, sir.<br> Come here.<br> I know you're trying to escape me.<br> It's useless.<br> I know everything you do.<br> I tried to be compassionate toward your kind.<br> You know nothing about our kind, you know only our remote ancestors who trembled before your tricks.<br> Your tricks don't frighten us.<br> Neither do you.<br> We've come a long way in 5,000 years.<br> But you're still of the same nature.<br> I could sweep you out of existence with a wave of my hand and bring you back again.<br> I can give life or death.<br> What else does mankind demand of its gods? Mankind has no need for gods.<br> We find the one quite adequate.<br> We shall not debate, mortal.<br> I offer you eternal rest and happiness according to the ancient ways.<br> I ask little in return.<br> But what I ask for, I insist upon.<br> Approach me.<br> I said approach me! We're busy.<br> Look after the girl.<br> You will gather laurel leaves.<br> Light the ancient fires.<br> Kill a deer.<br> Make your sacrifices to me! - Apollo has spoken! - Go! Gather laurel leaves, you must be joking.<br> Kill a deer! That's the funniest thing I ever heard.<br> Kill a deer! That's the funniest thing I ever heard.<br> Go ahead! - Stop.<br> - Lieutenant, get back! You shall reap the rewards of your insolence! - We're tired of your phoney fireworks.<br> - Mortal, you have earned this! - No, don't.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> Lieutenant! A father doesn't destroy his children.<br> You said you were gentle and understanding.<br> - Lieutenant! - How can they worship you - if you hurt them? - Lieutenant.<br> Apollo, please.<br> You know so much of love.<br> Please don't hurt them.<br> Please.<br> I shall be lenient with you for her sake.<br> You will make plans to bring the rest of your people down.<br> Be sure your artisans bring tools.<br> You will need homes.<br> And you will supply the herds of sheep and the pipes we will play and the simple skins we'll wear for clothes? You will dismantle your ship for the supplies you need.<br> And I'll crush its empty hull.<br> I have been too patient.<br> I shall be patient no longer.<br> Captain, we've got to do something.<br> We were doing something until our brave lady stepped in and saved us.<br> - Got any more good ideas, Jim? - Yes, I have.<br> One more, and it depends on the lieutenant's loyalty.<br> If she fails us, we'd better get used to herding goats.<br> Fools.<br> I offer them more than they could know.<br> Not just a world, but all that makes it up.<br> Man thinks he's progressed.<br> They're wrong.<br> He's merely forgotten those things which gave life meaning.<br> You'll all be provided for, cared for, happy.<br> There is an order of things in this universe.<br> Your species has denied it.<br> I come to restore it.<br> And for you, because you have the sensitivity to understand, I offer you more than your wildest dreams have ever imagined.<br> You'll become the mother of a new race of gods.<br> You'll inspire the universe.<br> All men will revere you, almost as a god yourself.<br> And I shall love you for time without end, worlds without end.<br> You shall complete me, and I you.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Kirk to Enterprise, come in.<br> - Kirk to - Carolyn! - What's happened to her? - Scotty, I'll find out.<br> Perhaps if I assisted - How old are you? - Twenty-two, sir.<br> Then I'd better handle it.<br> - You all right? - Oh, yes, I'm all right.<br> I have a message for you.<br> Come over there.<br> Well? He wants us to live in peace.<br> He wants to provide for us.<br> He'll give us everything we ever wanted.<br> And he can do it too.<br> All right, you can come down from Mount Olympus now.<br> You've got work to do.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - He thrives on love, worship, attention.<br> - Yes.<br> - We can't give him that worship.<br> None of us can.<br> Especially you.<br> What? Spurn him.<br> Reject him.<br> You must.<br> - You're special to him.<br> - Yes.<br> I love him.<br> Lieutenant, all our lives, here and on the ship, depend on you.<br> - No, not on me.<br> - On you, lieutenant.<br> Reject him and we have a chance to save ourselves.<br> Accept him and you condemn all of us to slavery, nothing less than slavery.<br> We might never get help this far out.<br> Or perhaps the thought of spending an eternity bending knee and tending sheep appeals to you.<br> Oh, but you don't understand.<br> He's kind and he wants the best for us.<br> And he's so lonely.<br> What you ask would break his heart.<br> Now, how can I? Give me your hand.<br> Your hand.<br> Now, feel that.<br> Human flesh against human flesh.<br> We're the same.<br> We share the same history, the same heritage, the same lives.<br> We're tied together beyond any untying.<br> Man or woman, it makes no difference.<br> We're human.<br> We couldn't escape from each other if we wanted to.<br> That's how you do it.<br> By remembering who and what you are.<br> A bit of flesh and blood afloat in a universe without end.<br> And the only thing that's truly yours is the rest of humanity.<br> That's where our duty lies.<br> Do you understand me? Yes.<br> Yes, I understand.<br> He's calling me.<br> Lieutenant, you have your orders and your duty.<br> Yes, sir, my orders and my duty.<br> I think we can try it now, sir.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> - Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Come in.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Spock here, captain.<br> We've pinpointed a power source on the planet's surface which seems to have something to do with the force field.<br> Is there a structure of some sort near you? - There is, indeed, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - The power emanates from there.<br> Very good.<br> How are you doing on the force field? We can negate sections of it, creating openings through which we can fire our phaser banks.<br> Well, that ought to do it.<br> Have Mr.<br> Sulu lock all phaser banks onto the structure.<br> Fire on my order only and cut it fine.<br> We'll be standing nearby.<br> Captain, I would recommend a discreet distance.<br> I'd love to oblige you, Mr.<br> Spock, but we're not all together.<br> Besides we have Apollo to deal with.<br> If that structure is the source of his power, I wanna know where he is when we attack it.<br> Kirk out.<br> Bones, do you think that mysterious organ in Apollo's chest has something to do with the transmission of energy? It doesn't serve any other purpose I know of.<br> Captain, we've got to wait until Carolyn comes back before we fire on the temple.<br> We don't know what would happen to her if he was suddenly attacked.<br> - She might get killed.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> I know, Scotty.<br> We'll wait.<br> I must say, Apollo, the way you ape human behaviour is remarkable.<br> But there are some other things I must know.<br> Your evolutionary patterns and your social development.<br> My what? I'm sure they're unique.<br> I've never encountered a specimen like you before.<br> I am Apollo.<br> I've chosen you.<br> But I'm sure that's very flattering, but I must get on with my work now.<br> - Your work? - I'm a scientist.<br> My particular speciality is ancient civilisations, relics and myths.<br> Why, surely you know I've only been studying you.<br> I don't believe it.<br> You love me.<br> Love you? Be logical.<br> I'm not some simple shepherdess you can awe.<br> Why, I could no more love you than I could love a new species of bacteria.<br> Carolyn, I forbid you to go.<br> I order you to stay.<br> Is that the secret of your power over women? The thunderbolts you throw? What the devil is that? - Kirk here.<br> - Spock, captain.<br> Sensors are picking up an atmospheric disturbance in your area.<br> Stand by your phasers, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Prepare to fire on my signal.<br> Kirk out.<br> We've got to go and find her.<br> We've gotta be here when he comes back.<br> - But what if he doesn't? What if.<br>.<br>? - Scotty, just hold on.<br> - No! - Captain.<br> All right.<br> The temple is his power source.<br> Let's bring him back to it.<br> Get to cover.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, fire those phasers.<br> - Captain, you're too close.<br> - Fire those phasers.<br> That's an order.<br> All phaser banks, fire.<br> No! Stop! Stop, I say! - All phaser banks, maintain firing rate.<br> - More power to the shields.<br> Stop! Scotty! Stop, I say! I command it! - All banks, maintain firing rate.<br> - Maintaining, sir.<br> Stop! Stop! Stop! I would have cherished you, cared for you.<br> I would have loved you as a father loves his children.<br> Did I ask so much? We've outgrown you.<br> You asked for something we can no longer give.<br> Carolyn, I loved you.<br> I would have made a goddess of you.<br> I've shown you my open heart.<br> See what you've done to me.<br> Zeus, Hermes, Hera, Aphrodite, you were right.<br> Athena, you were right.<br> The time has passed.<br> There is no room for gods.<br> Forgive me, my old friends.<br> Take me.<br> Take me.<br> - I wish we hadn't had to do this.<br> - So do I.<br> They gave us so much.<br> The Greek civilisation, much of our culture and philosophy, came from the worship of those beings.<br> In a way, they began the golden age.<br> Would it have hurt us, I wonder, just to have gathered a few laurel leaves?   <br>\n                </div>",

We would have known in advance of any system-wide catastrophe, and in the event of an interplanetary war, there would be considerable radioactive residue.<br> Our instruments show only normal background radiation.<br> - Any other possibilities? - Unknown, sir.<br> Sensor readings would've revealed the presence of any disease organisms.<br> They do not.<br> In addition, we received a routine report from this system only a week ago.<br> Even the Symbalene blood burn does not act that swiftly.<br> Captain, shields just snapped on.<br> Something heading in at multiwarp speeds.<br> Evasive manoeuvres, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> It's an extremely powerful bolt of energy, captain.<br> - Full power to the shields, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - I'm giving them all we've got.<br> All hands, red alert.<br> Phaser banks, stand by.<br> Photon torpedoes, condition red.<br> Condition red.<br> It's going to hit.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> - Shields still holding.<br> - Good.<br> Temporarily, captain.<br> Our shields absorbed the energy equivalent to 90 of our photon torpedoes.<br> Ninety? I may add, the energy used in repulsing this first attack reduced our shielding power First attack, sir? I think we can expect others, lieutenant.<br> We can resist three more such attacks.<br> The fourth will shatter our shields completely.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, pinpoint the source.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, evasive manoeuvres.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command.<br> Patch in my log.<br> Tell them what has happened.<br> That the Malurian race seems to have been destroyed by an unknown agency, and that we are under attack by an unidentified force.<br> Helmsman, I said evasive manoeuvres.<br> We're losing power, sir.<br> I'm having to divert the warp engine power into the shields, sir, if you want the protection.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, the speed of those bolts? - Approximately warp 15, captain.<br> Then we can't outrun them.<br> Good, Scotty, we're doing the right thing.<br> Source, Spock.<br> Unknown, captain.<br> Nothing within sensor range.<br> Something now, captain.<br> Very small.<br> Bearing: 123 degrees.<br> Marked: 18.<br> Range: 90,000 kilometres.<br> That's our target, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Prepare photon torpedoes.<br> Shields still holding, sir.<br> But the drain on the engines is reaching the critical point.<br> We just lost warp-manoeuvring power, switching to impulse.<br> Photon torpedoes armed, sir.<br> Has the target changed location, Mr.<br> Spock?

Computing now, captain.<br> Weight: 500 kilograms.<br> Shape: Roughly cylindrical.<br> Length: A fraction over 1 meter.<br> Five hundred kilos and only 1 meter long? What kind of intelligent creatures could exist in a thing that small?

Require communication.<br> Can you leave your ship? It is impossible to come aboard your ship because of the size differential.<br> Non sequitur.<br> Your facts are uncoordinated.<br> We are prepared to beam you aboard our ship.<br> That will be satisfactory.<br> Do you require any special conditions, any particular atmosphere or environment? - Negative.<br> I will come aboard.<br> - Good.<br> Hold your position.<br> We're locked onto your coordinates.<br> We'll beam you aboard.<br> Captain, you're not really gonna bring it in here? Do we have any choice, Scotty?

An opinion is a belief, a view, a judgement.<br> Insufficient response.<br> What's your source of power? It has changed since the point of origin.<br> There was much taken from the Other.<br> I am perpetual now.<br> I am Nomad.<br> Wasn't there a probe called Nomad launched in the early 2000s? Yes, it was reported destroyed.<br> There were no more in the series.<br> But if this is that probe I will scan your star charts.<br> I will bring them.<br> I have the capability of movement within your ship.<br> This way.<br> Now, Scotty, get our warp power up to full capacity.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Spock, Bones, come with us.<br> - Chart 14A, sir? - 14A.<br> - Nomad, can you scan that? - Yes.<br> This is our point of origin, the star we know as Sol.<br> You are from the third planet? - Yes.<br> - A planet with one large natural satellite? Yes.<br> The planet is called Earth? Yes.<br> You are the Creator, the Kirk.<br> The sterilization procedure against your ship was unnecessary.<br> What sterilization procedure? You are the Kirk, the Creator.<br> You programmed my function.<br> Well, I'm not the Kirk.<br> Tell me what your function is.<br> This is one of your units, Creator? Yes, he is.<br> It functions irrationally.<br> Sometimes.<br> But tell him your function nevertheless.<br> My function is to probe for biological infestations, to destroy that which is not perfect.<br> I am Nomad.<br> Biological infestation? There was never any probe sent out for that.<br> The history computer can answer that question.<br> I'll have the readout in a moment.<br> Did you destroy the Malurian system? Not the system, Creator Kirk, only the unstable biological infestation.<br> - It is my function.<br> - Unstable infestation? The population of four planets? What kind of function.<br>.<br>? Doctor.<br> Why do you call me the Creator? Is the usage incorrect? - Well, l - The usage is correct, Nomad.<br> The Creator was simply testing your memory banks.<br> There was much damage in the accident.<br> Mr.<br> Singh.<br> Come here a moment.<br> - This unit will see to your needs.<br> - Sir? I'll be back in a moment.<br> Gentlemen, come with me.<br> You're onto something.<br> What? I've correlated all the available information on the Nomad probe and I am convinced that this object is indeed that probe.<br> Ridiculous.<br> Earth science couldn't begin to build anything with those capabilities that long ago.<br> - True.<br> - Nomad was destroyed.<br> Presumed destroyed by a meteor collision.<br> I submit that it was badly damaged and somehow managed to repair itself.<br> I heard some lectures at the Academy on the Nomad probe.<br> Its mission was essentially peaceful.<br> Did I disturb you? Did you wish anything? Bridge to Auxiliary Control Room.<br> - Check in, please.<br> - Lieutenant Singh here.<br> All systems are normal, except warp-power indicators.<br> Mr.<br> Scott's engineers are working on them now.<br> Report to him when your indicators are registering properly.<br> Anything else? - One moment, lieutenant.<br> - Holding.<br> Where my heart is Where my heart is Where Somewhere Beyond the stars Beyond Antares This is the creator of Nomad.<br> Perhaps the most brilliant, though erratic, scientist of his time.<br> His dream was to build a perfect thinking machine, capable of independent logic.<br> Do you recall his name? Of course.<br> Jackson Roykirk.<br> Jackson Roykirk, Captain James Kirk.<br> Yes, similar.<br> Captain, I believe that Nomad thinks you are Roykirk.<br> That may well be why the attack was broken off.<br> It responded to your name, as well as its damaged memory banks permitted.<br> What do we have on Nomad itself, Spock? - Well, that's not the same.<br> - Essentially it is, doctor.<br> I believe that more happened to it than just damage in the meteor collision.<br> It mentioned \"the Other.<br>\" The unanswered question is, the Other what? Nomad was a thinking machine, the best to be engineered.<br> - It was a prototype.<br> - Its purpose was certainly altered.<br> His directive to seek out and destroy biological infestations could not have been programmed into it.<br> As I recall, it wasn't.<br> It was supposed to be the first interstellar probe to seek out new life forms.<br> Precisely, doctor.<br> And somehow that programming has been changed.<br> It would seem that Nomad is now seeking out perfect life forms.<br> Perfection being measured by its own relentless logic.<br> If what you say is true, then we've taken aboard our vessel a device which, sooner or later, must destroy us.<br> Security.<br> - Lieutenant Carlisle here.<br> - This is the captain.<br> The mechanism we brought aboard is in the Auxiliary Control Room.<br> Have a security team meet me there in five minutes.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Acknowledge.<br> Captain, Mr.<br> Singh reports that Nomad is no longer in the Auxiliary Control Room.<br> Security, cancel that order.<br> Implement a search for the mechanism.<br> All decks, report to me here.<br> Where my heart is Where The scented lunar flower - Bridge to captain.<br> - Captain here.<br> That mechanical beastie is up here.<br> On my way, Scotty.<br> Tomorrow A stop along the way There's where my love - What is the meaning? - What? What form of communication? I don't know what it Oh, my singing.<br> I was singing.<br> For what purpose is singing? I don't know.<br> L I like to sing.<br> I felt like music.<br> What is music? Think about music.<br> Lieutenant! - Keep away from that thing.<br> - Scotty! Bones.<br> He's dead, Jim.<br> - Why did you kill him? - The unit touched my screens.<br> That unit was my chief engineer.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Lieutenant, are you all right? Sickbay.<br> - What'd you do to her? - That unit is defective.<br> Its thinking is chaotic.<br> Absorbing it unsettled me.<br> That unit is a woman.<br> A mass of conflicting impulses.<br> Get Scott down below.<br> Will the Creator effect repairs on the unit Scott? - He's dead.<br> - Insufficient response.<br> His biological functions have ceased.<br> Does the Creator wish me to repair the unit? There's nothing I can do, Jim.<br> If there's a chance, it'll have to be soon.<br> All right, Nomad, repair the unit.<br> I require tapes on the structure.<br> Well, it'll need tapes on general anatomy, the central nervous system, and then one on the physiological structure of the brain.<br> We'd better give it all the neurological studies we have, as well as tracings of Scotty's hyper-encephalogram.<br> Nomad.<br> I have arranged the tapes for flash feed at the top speed of the computer.<br> Please do not draw the information faster than the machine's capacity.<br> Proceed.<br> Creator, the unit Scott is a primitive structure.<br> Insufficient safeguards built in.<br> Breakdown can occur from many causes.<br> Self-maintenance systems of low reliability.<br> It serves me as it is, Nomad.<br> Repair it.<br> Where is the unit Scott now? - The body is in Sickbay.<br> - Show me Sickbay.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy will show you.<br> Security.<br> I want a 24-hour, two-man armed surveillance on Nomad.<br> Pick him up in Sickbay.<br> No reaction, doctor.<br> I could have told you that without looking.<br> What are the lot of you staring at me for? - It's unbelievable.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - How did I get here? How did l.<br>.<br>? - It's all right.<br> That thing did something to Lieutenant Uhura.<br> She's being taken care of, it's all right.<br> Just take it easy and lie down, Scotty.<br> We just wanna check you out.<br> The unit Scott is repaired.<br> It will function correctly if your information to me was correct.<br> I'd like to check it out, if you don't mind.<br> A man is not just a biological unit that you can patch together.<br> What did it do to me? Dr.<br> McCoy will explain it to you.<br> Well, doctor? Nurse, I want him prepared for a full physical examination.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Nomad, come here.<br> Repair that unit.<br> Not possible.<br> You restored Scott.<br> He had much more extensive damage.<br> The unit Scott required simple structural repair.<br> The knowledge banks of this unit have been wiped clean.<br> Captain, if that is correct, if there has been no brain damage, only knowledge erased, she could be reeducated.<br> - Bones.<br> - Yes, I'll get on it right away.<br> And in spite of the way you repaired Scotty, you metal, ticking Does the Creator wish Nomad to wait elsewhere? Yes.<br> Nomad, you will go with these units.<br> They will take you to a waiting area.<br> Take it to the top security cell in the brig.<br> Doctor.<br> I interrupted you because Nomad would not have understood your anger.<br> It has great technical skill, but its reaction to emotion is unpredictable.<br> It almost qualifies as a life form.<br> That's a laugh.<br> A study of it would be of great use, captain.<br> It's a killer, Spock.<br> I intend to render it harmless.<br> Get down to the brig with your equipment.<br> Run an analysis on the mechanism.<br> I wanna know what makes that thing tick.<br> Yes, sir.<br> What's the problem? An almost human stubbornness, captain.<br> I have been unable to convince Nomad to lower its screens for analysis.<br> Without its cooperation, I can do nothing.<br> Nomad, you will allow Mr.<br> Spock to probe your memory banks and structure.<br> Mr.<br> Spock is also one of your biological units, Creator? Yes.<br> This unit is different.<br> It is well-ordered.<br> Follow your instructions, Nomad.<br> - My screens are down.<br> - Thank you.<br> You may proceed.<br> - \"See the dog.<br>\" - That's right.<br> \"See the dog\" Now, sound it out.<br> - \"Run.<br>\" - That's it, Uhura.<br> That's very good.<br> Now, try the next one.<br> \"The dog has a\" \"The dog h\" Not Swahili, Uhura.<br> In English.<br> The dog has a ball.<br> See? - Ball.<br> - Ball.<br> Now, you go ahead.<br> - \"The dog has a ball.<br>\" - That's right.<br> That's right, Uhura.<br> Here, you try another one.<br> I'll be right back.<br> All right, Christine.<br> How's she doing? Well, she's on the first-grade reader.<br> She's learning.<br> Seems to have an aptitude for mathematics.<br> Do you think we can reeducate her, doctor? Well, she checks out with no brain damage.<br> We've got all the educational tapes in our library.<br> Now it's up to us.<br> \"The ball is bluey.<br>\" Bluey? It is not sufficient, captain.<br> I get certain references to the accident, the Other, but nothing clear.<br> There are areas I simply cannot scan.<br> We've got to know about it, Spock.<br> What makes it operate, its compulsion for perfection.<br> Captain, I suggest the Vulcan mind probe.<br> Get into direct mental contact with that thing? - It seems the only way.<br> - You saw what it did to Uhura.<br> There is a risk.<br> But I have formed a partial hypothesis.<br> I must check it out.<br> Nomad, the unit Spock will touch you.<br> It is not an attack.<br> It is a form of communication.<br> You will permit it.<br> I will permit it, Creator.<br> I am Nomad.<br> I am performing my function.<br> Deep emptiness.<br> It approaches.<br> Collision, damage, blackness.<br> I am the Other.<br> I am Tan Ru.<br> Tan Ru.<br> Nomad.<br> Tan Ru.<br> Error.<br> Flaw.<br> Imperfection.<br> Must sterilize.<br> Rebirth.<br> We are complete.<br> Much power.<br> The Creator instructs.<br> Search out.<br> Identify.<br> Sterilize imperfections.<br> We are Nomad.<br> We are Nomad.<br> We are complete.<br> We are instructed.<br> Our purpose is clear.<br> Sterilize imperfections.<br> Sterilize imperfections.<br> Nomad sterilize.<br> - Sterilize.<br> Nomad.<br> Sterilize.<br> - Spock! - Nomad.<br> Sterilize.<br> Nomad.<br> - Spock!

Acknowledged.<br> - Spock.<br> - Amazing.<br> - Spock.<br> - Fascinating, captain.<br> The knowledge, the depth.<br> What does it mean, \"We are Nomad\"? It was It was damaged in deep space.<br> Undoubtedly the meteor collision.<br> Its memory banks were destroyed, or most of them.<br> It wandered without purpose.<br> And then it met the Other.<br> The Other was an alien probe of great power.<br> Somehow they merged.<br> Repaired each other, became one.<br> Then it isn't Nomad.<br> Not the Nomad we launched from Earth.<br> It took from the Other a new directive to replace its own.<br> The Other was originally programmed to secure and sterilize soil samples from other planets.<br> Probably as a prelude to colonization.<br> A changeling.<br> I beg your pardon.<br> An ancient Earth legend, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A changeling was a fairy child that was left in place of a human baby.<br> The changeling assumed the identity of the human child.<br> So it is to sterilize.<br> And for sterilize, read kill.<br> And it has the power and the sophistication to do it.<br> Yes, it's powerful and sophisticated, but it's not infallible.<br> It's space happy.<br> It thinks I'm its mother.<br> And that is the only thing that has saved us until now.<br> Yes.<br> Notify the captain.<br> What are you doing here? Watch your panels, everyone.<br> Watch that polymass.<br> Roger, help with the interfactor.<br> Leave that alone.<br> This primitive matter-antimatter propulsion system is the main drive? Aye.<br> Inefficiency exists in the antimatter input valve.<br> I will effect repair.<br> How are you doing that? The energy-release controls are also most inefficient.<br> I shall effect repair.<br> - Warp 8, Mr.<br> Scott, and increasing.<br> - Lower your dampers.<br> Warp 9.<br> Cut your circuits, all of them.<br> Warp 10, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Impossible.<br> It can't go that fast.<br> She just won't stop, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Warp 11.<br> Nomad, stop what you're doing.<br> Scotty.<br> Is there a problem, Creator? I have increased engine efficiency 57 percent.<br> You will destroy my ship.<br> Its structure cannot stand the stress of that much power.<br> - Turn off your repair operation.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> It is reversed as ordered, Creator.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, give Sulu warp 2 and keep her there.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Captain.<br> I've examined the brig.<br> The force-field door on the security cell is damaged.<br> And the guards have vanished.<br> I must assume they are dead.<br> - You killed two of my - Creator, your biological units are inefficient.<br> Nomad, it's about time I told you who and what you are.<br> I'm a biological unit and I created you.<br> Non sequitur.<br> Biological units are inherently inferior.<br> This is an inconsistency.<br> Nomad, there are two men waiting outside.<br> You will not harm them.<br> They will escort you back to the waiting area.<br> You will stay there.<br> You will do nothing.<br> I am programmed to investigate.<br> I have given you new programming, and you will implement it.<br> There is much to be considered before I return to launch point.<br> I must reevaluate.<br> Reevaluate? I suspect it is about to reevaluate its creator.<br> It may have been unwise to admit to Nomad that you are a biological unit.<br> In Nomad's eyes, you must now undoubtedly appear imperfect.<br> - It was a foolish mistake.<br> - Even worse, Nomad just now made a reference to its launch point, Earth.<br> Spock, do you think it's possible that it got a fix on Earth when it tapped the computers earlier? I do not believe there is much beyond Nomad's capabilities.<br> Then we've shown it the way home.<br> And when it gets there It will find the Earth infested with imperfect biological units.<br> And it will carry out its prime directive: Sterilize.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3541.<br>9.<br> The presence of Nomad aboard my ship has become nightmarish.<br> Now it apparently means to return to Earth.<br> Once there, it would automatically destroy all life.<br> Hey, Nomad, stop.<br> Nomad, this way.<br> Captain Kirk to Sickbay.<br> Emergency.<br> Manual controls.<br> No response.<br> Nomad.<br> Nomad.<br> Stop.<br> Nomad, stop! Nomad.<br> - Is she all right? - I think so.<br> - It looks like some kind of shock.<br> - What happened? Nomad examined the personnel files and the medical history.<br> She tried to stop him.<br> - Whose history? - Yours.<br> Since it specifically examined your history, I suggest it has completed its reevaluation.<br> And found that its creator is as imperfect as all the other biological units.<br> Bridge to captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Life-support systems are out all over the ship.<br> Manual override has been blocked.<br> Source: Engineering.<br> - Nomad.<br> - Undoubtedly.<br> With the systems out, we'll only have enough air and heat Get Scotty, some antigravs and meet me in Engineering.<br> Nomad, stop what you're doing and effect repairs on the life-support systems.<br> Stop.<br> You're programmed to obey the orders of your creator.<br> I am programmed to destroy those life forms which are imperfect.<br> These alterations will do so without destroying the vessel which surrounds them.<br> It too is imperfect, but can be adjusted.<br> Nomad.<br> I admit that biological units are imperfect, but a biological unit created you.<br> I am perfect.<br> I am Nomad.<br> No, you're not Nomad.<br> You're an alien machine.<br> Your programming tapes have been altered.<br> You are in error.<br> You are a biological unit.<br> You are imperfect.<br> - But I am your creator.<br> - You are the Creator.<br> - I created you.<br> - You are the Creator.<br> But I admit I am imperfect.<br> How could I have created such a perfect thing as you? Answer unknown.<br> I shall analyse.<br> Analysis complete.<br> Insufficient data to resolve problem.<br> But my programming is whole.<br> My purpose remains.<br> I am Nomad.<br> I am perfect.<br> That which is imperfect must be sterilized.<br> Then you will continue to destroy that which thinks and lives and is imperfect? I shall continue.<br> I shall return to launch point Earth.<br> I shall sterilize.<br> You must sterilize in case of error.<br> Error is inconsistent with my prime function.<br> Sterilization is correction.<br> Everything that is in error must be sterilized? There are no exceptions.<br> Nomad, I made an error in creating you.<br> The creation of perfection is no error.<br> I did not create perfection, I created error.<br> Your data is faulty.<br> I am Nomad.<br> I am perfect.<br> - I am the Kirk, the Creator? - You are the Creator.<br> You're wrong! Jackson Roykirk, your creator, is dead.<br> You have mistaken me for him.<br> You are in error.<br> You did not discover your mistake.<br> You have made two errors.<br> You are flawed and imperfect.<br> sterilization.<br> You've made three errors.<br> Error!

The destruction of Nomad was a great waste, captain.<br> It was a remarkable instrument.<br> Which might well have destroyed more billions of lives.<br> It's well gone.<br> Besides, what are you feeling so badly about? It's not easy to lose a bright and promising son.<br> - Sir? - Well, it thought I was its mother, didn't it? Do you think I'm completely without feelings, Spock? You saw what it did for Scotty.<br> What a doctor it would have made.<br> My son, the doctor.<br> Kind of gets you right there, doesn't it?   <br>\n                </div>",

It's called blood.<br> Watch your step.<br> The officers move up by assassination.<br> Chekov tried it on me.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu is security chief, like the ancient Gestapo.<br> And my Sickbay is a chamber of horrors.<br> Two of my assistants were betting on the tolerance of an injured man, how long it would take him to pass out from the pain.<br> - Report on technology.<br> - Mostly variations in instrumentation.<br> - Nothing I can't handle.<br> - Star readings? Everything's exactly where it should be, except us.<br> Let's find out where we stand.<br> - Computer.<br> - Ready.<br> This is the captain.<br> Record security research to be classified under my voiceprint or Mr.<br> Scott's.<br> Recording.<br> Produce all data relevant to the recent ion storm.<br> Correlate the following hypothesis: Could a storm of such magnitude cause a power surge in the transporter circuits, creating a momentary interdimensional contact with a parallel universe? Affirmative.<br> At such a moment, could persons in each universe, in the act of beaming, transpose with their counterparts in the other universe? Affirmative.<br> Could conditions necessary to such an event be created artificially, using the ship's power? Affirmative.<br> Record procedure.<br> Scotty, can you do it? Not by myself.<br> I'll need help.<br> You'd be too conspicuous.<br> I'm a doctor, not an engineer.<br> Now you're an engineer.<br> I'll have to tap the power we need from the warp engines and balance it for the four of us.<br> Jim, the way this ship is run, what kind of people are we in this universe? Let's find out.<br> Computer.<br> Ready.<br> Read out official record of current command.<br> Captain James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Succeeded to command ISS Enterprise through assassination of Captain Christopher Pike.<br> First action: Suppression of Gorlan uprising through destruction of rebel home planet.<br> Second action: Execution of 5,000 colonists on Vega IX.<br> Cancel.<br> - Now we know.<br> - Captain.<br> - We can do it.<br> - Good.<br> We have to lay in the automatic-transporter setting.<br> But when we interrupt engine circuits to tie the power increase into the transporter, it'll show up on Sulu's security board.<br> Of course, we'll only need a second.<br> I'll tell Uhura to create a diversion to distract Sulu's attention at your signal.<br> We'd better get back to our posts.<br> Keep me advised.<br> Jim.<br> If we're here, what do you suppose our counterparts are doing back in our universe? On our Enterprise.<br> I order you! Let me go! Traitors! Spock, get these men off me! What do you think you're doing, Spock? You traitorous pig.<br> I'll hang you up by your Vulcan ears.<br> - I'll have you all executed! - I think not.<br> Your authority on this ship is extremely limited, captain.<br> The four of you will remain here in the brig, and in custody, until I discover how to return you to wherever it is you belong.<br> Has the whole galaxy gone crazy? What kind of a uniform is this? Where's your beard? What's going on? Where's my personal guard? I can answer none of your questions at this time.<br> All right, Spock.<br> Whatever your game is, I'll play it.<br> You want credits? I'll give them to you.<br> You'll be a rich man.<br> A command of your own? I can swing that too.<br> Apparently, some kind of transposition has taken place.<br> I find it extremely interesting.<br> Spock, what is it that will buy you? - Power? - Fascinating.<br> Power, Spock? I can get that for you! Captain.<br> I am pleased that you frustrated Mr.<br> Chekov's plan.<br> I should regret your death.<br> - Why? - I do not desire the captaincy.<br> I much prefer my scientific duties, and I am, frankly, content to be a lesser target.<br> Logical, as always, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The agony booth is a most effective means of discipline.<br> I presume you've ordered full duration? I haven't decided.<br> Indeed? - His act warrants death.<br> - I said, I haven't decided.<br> That is, of course, your affair.<br> Captain, may I enquire if you intend to persist in your unusual course of action regarding the Halkans? You heard my orders.<br> They are, of course, in contradiction to standard Empire procedure.<br> You cannot ignore the consequences.<br> Is that a threat? I do not threaten, captain.<br> I merely state facts.<br> I have found you to be an excellent officer.<br> Our missions together have been both successful and profitable.<br> However, I shall not permit your aberrations to jeopardise my position.<br> Spock do you think we should destroy the Halkans? Terror must be maintained, or the Empire is doomed.<br> - It is the logic of history.<br> - Conquest is easy.<br> Control is not.<br> We may have bitten off more than we can chew.<br> Captain, I do not wish to find myself opposing you.<br> But if you continue on your present course, this confusing, inexplicable behaviour Is my concern, not yours.<br> You would find me a formidable enemy.<br> I am aware of that, captain.<br> I trust that you are aware of the reverse.<br> Orders, sir? Release Chekov.<br> Confine him to quarters.<br> Yes, sir.<br> That ought to hold him for about six hours.<br> I fell asleep.<br> We had quite a time in the Chem Lab picking up after the storm.<br> Nothing compared to your day, I gather.<br> I heard about Chekov.<br> He gambled.<br> I won.<br> You got lucky.<br> I'm surprised that you could be caught off guard that way.<br> I was preoccupied.<br> You're still in trouble with Starfleet Command.<br> What you've got in mind this time is beyond me.<br> You're scheming, of course.<br> The Halkans have something you want.<br> Or is it all some clever means to advance you to the admiralty? Kirk.<br> - The cabinet itself? - Further than that, if I'm successful.<br> Really? Well, you must know what you're doing.<br> You always do.<br> If I'm to be the woman of a Caesar can't I know what you're up to? - Kirk here.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, captain.<br> Yes? I've received a private communication from Starfleet Command.<br> I am committing a breach of regulations by informing you of its contents.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock? I'm instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission.<br> And if I don't? In that event, I am ordered to kill you and to proceed against the Halkans as the new captain of the Enterprise.<br> Captain's log, stardate unknown.<br> We are trapped in a savage parallel universe from which we must escape within four hours or I will face a death sentence at Mr.<br> Spock's hands.<br> Let's drink a toast to Spock, the only man aboard with the decency to warn you.<br> And he'll die for it.<br> You'll never find another man like him.<br> I don't intend to kill him.<br> Are you going to act against the Halkans before the deadline? No.<br> But I'll avoid killing Spock.<br> Just get him out of the way? He and his men? I'll get out of his way.<br> Shall I activate the Tantalus field? You'll at least want to monitor him, won't you? Yes.<br> I hate this thing.<br> - It's not that bad.<br> - Of course not.<br> It made you captain.<br> How many enemies have you simply wiped out of existence by the touch of a button? Fifty? A hundred? And I always thought that was funny.<br> The great, powerful Captain Kirk, who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist and a plundered laboratory.<br> Well, if you don't take advantage of your opportunities You don't rise to the command of a starship.<br> Or even higher.<br> That magnificent mind of his.<br> But it can't protect him from this.<br> I press it, and he dies.<br> Now? You really mean it.<br> It doesn't matter.<br> If Spock fails his order, he'll be killed anyway.<br> I'll see to it that the circumstances of his failure will clear him.<br> You're not even afraid of Starfleet Command.<br> Can your scheme bring you that much power so quickly? And what about me? How does Marlena fit in? How does Marlena want to fit in? - Scotty.<br> - Scotty here, sir.<br> We have to get out of here within three hours.<br> Spock has orders to kill me unless I complete the military mission.<br> - We've got another deadline too, sir.<br> - Explain.<br> The two-way matter transmission affected the local field density between the universes and it's increasing.<br> We've got to move fast.<br> - How fast? - A half hour, at the most.<br> If we miss? We couldn't get out of here in a century.<br> Now, we're ready to bridge power from the engines to the transporter.<br> You've got to get down there and free the board so we can lock in.<br> Give me about ten minutes.<br> I've gotta complete a few more computations.<br> All right, I'll be in the Transporter Room in ten minutes.<br> - I'll meet you in the Sickbay afterward.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Computer.<br> - Ready.<br> Explain computer activity in the Engineering section.<br> A security research is in progress.<br> Who is conducting the research? The captain and Mr.<br> Scott.<br> What is the nature of the research? Program is classified under voice-index lock.<br> Why are you monitoring my communications, Mr.<br> Sulu? My security board has detected extensive use of computer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I was about to inform you.<br> It's not hard to guess the nature of your order from Starfleet Command.<br> I suggest a connection, the captain suspects.<br> He's working on escape or defence.<br> That is my concern.<br> Correct, it's your play.<br> I hope you succeed, because the order would fall on me next.<br> And you know how Captain Kirk's enemies have a habit of disappearing.<br> If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy.<br> I do not want to command the Enterprise.<br> But if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death.<br> And some of them are Vulcans.<br> Oiling my traps, darling.<br> I'm afraid I'm a little out of practise.<br> Maybe that's what happened to us.<br> It's very hard for a working officer to shine as a woman every minute.<br> - And you demand perfection.<br> - I've never seen perfection.<br> But no woman could come closer to it.<br> I remember when you used to talk that way.<br> - I still do.<br> - Prove it.<br> - I've gotta go.<br> - Ship's business? An important task on the crew deck? Well, I guess it's over.<br> Commander Kenner will take me temporarily.<br> He's made that quite clear.<br> I'll call a yeoman to help me with my things.<br> You don't have to do that.<br> Are you feeling sorry for me? Do I see hesitation in your eyes, about anything? I want one thing, captain: Transfer me.<br> On the Enterprise, I am humiliated.<br> On another ship, I can hunt fresh game.<br> I've got my rank, and Don't I? I've been a captain's woman and I like it.<br> I'll be one again, if I have to go though every officer in the fleet.<br> You could.<br> I simply meant that you could be anything you want to be.<br> It's been a long time since you've kissed me like that.<br> You're a stranger.<br> Mercy to the Halkans, mercy to Spock, to me.<br> Am I your woman? You're the captain's woman until he says you're not.<br> Uhura.<br> Yes, captain.<br> Scotty's signal should be coming through any moment now.<br> - You know what to do.<br> - I've got a pretty good idea, sir.<br> - Keep Sulu's attention off that board.<br> - I'll do my best, sir.<br> Good luck.<br> Kirk out.<br> You aren't very persistent, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> The game has rules.<br> You're ignoring them.<br> I protest, and you come back.<br> You didn't come back.<br> - Now you're making sense.<br> - I was getting bored.<br> Of course, this isn't the time.<br> Any time's a good time.<br> I'm afraid I changed my mind again.<br> You take a lot of chances, lieutenant.<br> So do you, mister.<br> So do you.<br> Take over for me.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> All clear.<br> On my way to Sickbay.<br> Now it's up to the captain.<br> You will please restrict your movements, captain.<br> What are you doing? Are you gonna shoot me now, Spock? I thought I had until dawn.<br> I shall make that decision.<br> Since you returned from the planet, you have behaved in a most atypical and illogical manner.<br> - I want to know why.<br> - Shoot.<br> You're wasting time.<br> I shall not waste time with you.<br> You're too inflexible, too disciplined, once you've made up your mind.<br> But Dr.<br> McCoy has a plenitude of human weaknesses.<br> Sentimental, soft.<br> You may not tell me what I want to know, but he will.<br> You're running a big risk, Spock.<br> I have the phaser, captain.<br> And I do not intend to simply disappear as so many of your opponents have in the past.<br> If you please.<br> Sickbay.<br> Yes, of course.<br> The entire landing party.<br> Captain, stand over there.<br> Doctor, it is time for answers.<br> How much time, Scotty? Hardly 15 minutes, sir.<br> The field density between the two universes is starting to close very fast.<br> Help me get him on the table.<br> Come on, help me get him on the table! He'll die without immediate treatment.<br> Everything laid in, Scotty? The time lag, so the operator can get into the transporter chamber? All laid in, sir.<br> Come on, McCoy, we're taking a chance on not getting back home.<br> We'll get home.<br> This won't take long.<br> Fourteen minutes.<br> We've got to go! You shut up! I can save his life.<br> Do you want me to stop, Jim? It'll only take a minute.<br> He is very much like our own Mr.<br> Spock, isn't he? You've got that minute.<br> A little time, he'll live.<br> What is this, Mr.<br> Sulu? Mr.<br> Spock has orders to kill you, captain.<br> He will succeed.<br> Apparently, you will also appear to have killed him after a fierce battle.<br> Regrettable, but it will leave me in command.<br> Captain, we've barely got ten minutes.<br> Let's go, Bones.<br> I can't let him die, Jim.<br> You get to the Transporter Room, make sure it's clear.<br> - I'll be there in five minutes.<br> - No longer.<br> I guarantee it.<br> Now, go on, please.<br> Why did the captain let me live? Our minds are merging, doctor.<br> Our minds are one.<br> I feel what you feel.<br> I know what you know.<br> A friend.<br> Activate the transporter.<br> You saved us back in Sickbay, with the Tantalus field.<br> - Take me with you.<br> - I can't.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Our power's balanced for four.<br> There's no guarantee we'll make it with five.<br> All could die.<br> - Scotty? - It's working, sir.<br> - But there are only three of you.<br> - One is coming.<br> I'd help you if I could, Marlena.<br> Believe that.<br> If you kill us, you'll still stay.<br> Where's McCoy? - Time, Scotty? - Five minutes, sir.<br> Do you know what they'll do to me? The power is cut, sir.<br> They're on to us! - Auxiliary? - Aye, it's available.<br> - Can you bridge to your setup? - I can get us the power, but the automatic setting is linked to the transporter main.<br> If we bypass, it means that someone has got to operate the controls manually.<br> - One of us will have to stay.<br> - I'll stay, captain.<br> Get to the transporter chamber.<br> You too, Uhura.<br> Jim.<br> That's an order, Scotty.<br> Aye, captain.<br> What about me? McCoy I cut the transporter power.<br> It was necessary to delay your beam-out until I could arrive.<br> Engineering, reactivate main transporter circuits.<br> You're a man of integrity in both universes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You must return to your universe, I must have my captain back.<br> I'll operate the transporter.<br> You have two minutes and ten seconds.<br> For that time, I have something to say.<br> How long before the Halkan prediction of galactic revolt is realised? - Approximately 240 years.<br> - The inevitable outcome? The Empire shall be overthrown, of course.<br> The illogic of waste, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The waste of lives, potential resources, time.<br> I submit to you that your Empire is illogical because it cannot endure.<br> I submit that you are illogical to be a willing part of it.<br> You have one minute and 23 seconds.<br> If change is inevitable, predictable, beneficial, doesn't logic demand that you be a part of it? One man cannot summon the future But one man can change the present.<br> Be the captain of this Enterprise, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Find a logical reason for sparing the Halkans, and make it stick.<br> Push till it gives.<br> You can defend yourself better than any man in the fleet.<br> Captain, get in the chamber! What about it, Spock? The man must also have the power.<br> In my cabin is a device that will make you invincible.<br> - Indeed? - What will it be? Past or future? Tyranny or freedom? It's up to you.<br> It is time.<br> In every revolution, there is one man with a vision.<br> Captain Kirk, I shall consider it.<br> - Spock.<br> - Welcome home, captain.<br> What I don't understand is how you were able to identify our counterparts so quickly.<br> It was far easier for you, as civilised men, to behave like barbarians than it was for them, as barbarians, to behave like civilised men.<br> I assume they returned to their Enterprise at the same time you appeared here? Probably.<br> However, that Jim Kirk will find a few changes, if I read my Spocks correctly.<br> Jim, I think I liked him with a beard better.<br> Gave him character.<br> Of course, almost any change would be a distinct improvement.<br> What worries me is the easy way his counterpart fitted into that other universe.<br> I always thought Spock was a bit of a pirate at heart.<br> Indeed, gentlemen.<br> May I point out that I had opportunity to observe your counterparts here quite closely.<br> They were brutal, savage, unprincipled, uncivilised, treacherous.<br> In every way, splendid examples of homo sapiens, the very flower of humanity.<br> I found them quite refreshing.<br> I'm not sure, but I think we've been insulted.<br> I'm sure.<br> Captain Kirk? - Lieutenant Lieutenant? - Marlena Moreau.<br> I was just assigned last week.<br> All right, lieutenant.<br> Carry on.<br> Met her before, captain? Why do you ask? Your reaction.<br> One of recognition? Oh, no.<br> No, no, we haven't met before exactly.<br> She just seemed a nice, likeable girl.<br> I think we could become friends.<br> It's possible.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tStart your reading.<br> Well, I just might stake out a claim and settle down here, Jim.<br> - It is spectacular, isn't it? - It's a shame to have to intrude.<br> Well, the last scout ship reported some pretty strange sensor readings.<br> Starfleet wants it investigated and the inhabitants contacted.<br> We'll do what we're told.<br> The soil here is remarkably rich and fertile, captain.<br> Husbandry would be quite efficacious.<br> Oh, quite sure.<br> Readings indicate the entire planet is covered with growth like this.<br> Curious.<br> Even at the poles there's very little variation in temperature, which maintains a planet-wide average of 76 degrees.<br> I know.<br> Almost impossible.<br> It makes me homesick.<br> Just like Russia.<br> More like the Garden of Eden, ensign.<br> Of course, doctor.<br> The Garden of Eden was just outside Moscow.<br> A very nice place.<br> It must have made Adam and Eve very sad to leave.<br> Just outside Moscow.<br> All right.<br> There's a village about 17 kilometres away on bearing 232.<br> We'll head that way.<br> Captain.<br> Captain.<br> Dead.<br> What did somebody say? That paradise must have looked like this? Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3715.<br>3.<br> While making a routine exploration of the unexplored Gamma Trianguli VI, one of my men has been killed by a poisonous plant.<br> As soon as we get out of the way, beam the body up.<br> Aye, captain.<br> It's a shame about Hendorff.<br> - We seem to have a problem too.<br> - What is it? We're losing potency in our antimatter pods.<br> I don't think it's serious, but we're looking into it.<br> - What's causing it? - I'm not sure, sir.<br> But we've run measurements on the electromagnetic field of the planet, and they are a wee bit abnormal.<br> That might have something to do with it.<br> But you say there's nothing to worry about? Well, sir, I didn't exactly say that.<br> Stay on top of it.<br> We got a job to do here, might as well finish it.<br> I hear it's nice down there.<br> Yeah.<br> It's nice.<br> If we're a little more careful, we shouldn't run into any more trouble.<br> I could do with a nice walk in a garden with green leaves and grass.<br> We'll do the walking, Scotty.<br> You get on the antimatter pod.<br> If it gets any worse, let me know, we'll beam up.<br> Kirk out.<br> I find that most unusual, captain.<br> Scotty will handle it.<br> We've got a job to do.<br> Turn up anything on your tricorder? Indeed.<br> Subsurface vibrations for miles in all directions.<br> That's strange.<br> Quite strong, fairly regular, artificially produced.<br> Mallory.<br> Yes, captain.<br> We're heading for the village.<br> Avoid contact with the humanoids, but I want you and Marple to make a full reconnaissance, so be careful.<br> There may be other danger besides poisonous plants.<br> - Keep in constant communication.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain.<br> What is it? There's a humanoid hiding directly behind us, moving with remarkable agility, bearing 18.<br> - What is it, Mr.<br> Spock? - A visitor, and one wanting to retain his anonymity, I should say.<br> All this beauty, and now Mr.<br> Hendorff dead, somebody watching us It's frightening.<br> If you insist on worrying, worry about me.<br> I've been wanting to get you in a place like this for a long time.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, Yeoman Landon, I know you find each other fascinating, but we're not here to conduct a field experiment in human biology.<br> I was just about to take some readings.<br> - Anything? - Whatever it is, it moves like a cat.<br> Jim, I don't like this.<br> Neither do I.<br> All hands.<br> We've been watched, we'll probably be watched.<br> We're moving out.<br> Formation L.<br> Interesting.<br> Extremely low specific gravity.<br> Some uraninite, hornblende, quartz.<br> Fragile, good cleavage.<br> An analysis should prove interesting.<br> Would you mind being careful where you throw your rocks, Spock? Obviously highly unstable, captain.<br> This could be a find of some importance.<br> In large quantities, it could be a considerable source of power.<br> A Garden of Eden with land mines.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Scott, sir.<br> Our antimatter pods are completely inert.<br> I couldn't stop it, but I know why.<br> Why? Something from the surface.<br> Like a pail of water on a fire.<br> A beam, maybe, or a transmission.<br> And it's still on.<br> I'm having it analysed, but it's like nothing I've ever seen before.<br> And it's pinpointed in the area of that village we located down there.<br> We're heading there now, Scotty.<br> Do you need any help? There's nothing you can do about it, sir.<br> There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger.<br> All right, Scotty, we'll try and find out what's going on down here.<br> Kirk out.<br> If Scott is correct about the force from the surface, it may have to do with the vibrations I read earlier.<br> Some kind of generator? If so, an immense one.<br> Probably subterranean.<br> What's that? Some of the thorns like those that killed Hendorff.<br> See this stuff on the end? It's like saponin, only it's a thousand times stronger.<br> Peculiar stuff to find in paradise.<br> Jim! Spock! Spock! Security alert.<br> Is he alive? I filled him with enough Masiform D to make the whole crew turn handsprings and he's not responding.<br> Gotta get him back to the ship, Jim.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> We're beaming up.<br> Notify Transporter Room.<br> And make arrangements to pick up Mallory and Marple.<br> They're scouting ahead of us.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Transporter Room, stand by to beam up landing party.<br> All hands! Standing by, sir.<br> Energise.<br> Energise.<br> Scotty, energise.<br> Scotty, what's the matter? We can't make transporter contact, sir.<br> The entire system's inhibited.<br> The way it is now, we couldn't beam up a fly.<br> Captain's log, supplementary.<br> Our investigation of Gamma Trianguli VI has suddenly turned into a nightmare.<br> We're being watched and followed.<br> Mr.<br> Spock has been injured.<br> And now we find we are unable to return to the ship.<br> Scotty, is the transporter malfunction tied in with the trouble you're having with the antimatter pods? I don't know, sir.<br> I'll check and get back to you.<br> Scott out.<br> Spock.<br> You all right? Dr.<br> McCoy's potion is acting like all his potions, turning my stomach.<br> Other than that, I am quite well.<br> If your blood were red instead of green, you wouldn't have an upset stomach.<br> Just what do you think you were trying to do? I surmised you were unaware of that plant, so l Stepped in front and took the thorns yourself.<br> I assure you, captain, I had no intention of doing that.<br> It was merely my own clumsiness which prevented me from moving out of the way.<br> I see.<br> Well, next time just yell.<br> I can step out of the way as quickly as the next man.<br> I shall do so.<br> Trying to get yourself killed.<br> You know how much Starfleet has invested in you? - 122,200 - Never mind.<br> But thanks.<br> - Kaplan, take the post.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Not only is something after us, but it's after the ship as well.<br> Captain, to affect the ship at this extreme range would require a highly sophisticated planetary defence system.<br> Thirty seconds ago there wasn't a cloud in the sky.<br> Take cover! Phasers.<br> A beautiful day, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Not a cloud in the sky.<br> Just like paradise.<br> Kirk here.<br> Mallory here, captain.<br> I'm near the village.<br> Coordinates 118 by 220.<br> Mallory.<br> Mallory, are you all right? Come in.<br> The village is primitive.<br> Strictly tribal, from the looks of it.<br> And, captain, there's something else.<br> Captain, come in.<br> Mallory.<br> Mallory, are you all right? Mallory! Captain, those coordinates are a short distance in that direction.<br> On the double.<br> It's over there, that way! I never saw anything like it.<br> Mallory! Marple, stand back.<br> Watch it.<br> Rocks.<br> - Captain.<br> - Hendorff I know Kaplan's family.<br> Now Mallory.<br> Jim, you couldn't have stopped any of this.<br> His father helped me get into the academy.<br> Captain, in each case, this was unavoidable.<br> - I could've prevented all of it.<br> - I don't see how.<br> Walk in paradise among the green grass and the flowers.<br> I should've beamed up at the first sign of trouble.<br> You are under orders to investigate this planet and this culture.<br> I also have the option to disregard those orders if I consider them overly hazardous.<br> This isn't that important a mission, Spock, not worth the lives of three of my men.<br> I dropped my guard for a minute because I like the smell of growing things.<br> And now three men are dead, and the ship's in trouble.<br> No one has ever stated that Starfleet duty was particularly safe.<br> You've followed the correct and logical course, done everything a commander could do.<br> Self-recriminations Captain, our friend is back.<br> Marple.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, at attention.<br> Gentlemen, something or someone is behind that rock.<br> I want it.<br> Marple, cut around the rock, to your right.<br> Make a loud noise.<br> Be careful.<br> Spock, you and Chekov create a diversion and make it loud.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, your tricorder readings are totally inefficient.<br> Mind your own business, sir.<br> For your information, I have a very high efficiency rating.<br> Ensign, I will not have you address me in that tone of voice! What do you want, violins? I won't hurt you.<br> Do you understand? I won't hurt you.<br> You struck me with your hand.<br> Well, I won't strike you again.<br> You've been following us, watching us.<br> Why? I am the Eyes of Vaal.<br> He must see.<br> Who is Vaal? Vaal is Vaal.<br> He is everything.<br> - Do you have a name? - I am Akuta.<br> I am the leader of the Feeders of Vaal.<br> They're not going to hurt you, I promise you.<br> Akuta.<br> Akuta.<br> We come in peace.<br> We would like to speak to this Vaal.<br> Akuta alone speaks to Vaal.<br> I am the eyes and the voice of Vaal.<br> It is Vaal's wish.<br> Captain, this is fascinating.<br> If you will permit me, sir? Antennae? They are my ears for Vaal.<br> They were given to me in the Dim Time, so the people could understand his commands, and obey.<br> You speak of the People of Vaal.<br> Are they nearby? We are close to Vaal so we may serve him.<br> I shall take you there.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Condition Red! Condition Red! Captain, something has grabbed us from the planet's surface.<br> Like a giant tractor beam.<br> And we can't break loose.<br> It's no use, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> We're just barely holding our own.<br> Are the warp drives still out? Aye, sir.<br> All we have is impulse power.<br> Put it on maximum.<br> Full emergency circuits.<br> They're all on, captain.<br> Status.<br> Are you still holding? - Kyle.<br> - No, sir.<br> We're slipping.<br> Computer banks, Kyle.<br> Feed in our rate, get me a figure.<br> We might be able to pull out with warp drive, but without it, we're like a fly on flypaper.<br> Even worse.<br> We're starting to lose ground.<br> Hurry up with the figure, Kyle.<br> Maintain full reverse thrust against the pull.<br> Put a team on that warp drive.<br> Get it working.<br> I've done that, captain.<br> They haven't been able to do a thing.<br> It's no good, captain.<br> With maximum thrust against the pull, we'll only be able to maintain full power for 16 hours.<br> Then we burn up for sure.<br> Scotty, you're my chief engineer.<br> You know everything about that ship there is to know, more than the men who designed it.<br> If you can't get those warp engines working, you're fired.<br> I'll do everything there is to do, sir.<br> Scott out.<br> Tell me about Vaal.<br> All the world knows about Vaal.<br> He causes the rains to fall, and the sun to shine.<br> All good comes from Vaal.<br> Take me to him.<br> I wish to speak to him.<br> I shall take you to him, but he will not speak to you.<br> He speaks only to me.<br> I'll take my chances.<br> Vaal.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3715.<br>6.<br> We have been introduced to Vaal, evidently the source of the planet's power emanations and possibly the force that threatens both us and our ship.<br> Fascinating.<br> A very high order of workmanship.<br> Very ancient.<br> Generating great power.<br> But this is not the centre, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No, captain.<br> The centre is deep in the earth beneath us.<br> This is an access point.<br> It would also seem to be a - A force field? - Obviously.<br> - You all right? - Yes, quite.<br> It extends some 30 feet beyond the figure in all directions.<br> Conventional in composition, and quite formidable.<br> Akuta, how do you talk to Vaal? Vaal calls me.<br> Only then.<br> Well, we can't get to it, can't talk to it unless it wants to talk to us Vaal sleeps now.<br> When he is hungry, you may be able to speak with him, if he desires it.<br> - When does he get hungry? - Soon.<br> Come.<br> We will give you food and drink.<br> If you are tired, you may rest.<br> These are the People of Vaal.<br> Where are the others? There are no others.<br> The children.<br> Children? You use unknown words to me.<br> Little ones, like yourselves.<br> They grow.<br> Replacements.<br> None are necessary.<br> They are forbidden by Vaal.<br> But when a man and woman fall in love \"Love.<br>\" Strange words, \"children,\" \"love.<br>\" What is love? Love is when two people are Yes, the holding, the touching.<br> Vaal has forbidden this.<br> Well, there goes paradise.<br> These people are from another place.<br> They have come among us.<br> Welcome them.<br> Welcome to Vaal.<br> Our homes are open to you.<br> Well, thank you.<br> It does something for you.<br> Yes, indeed, it does, captain.<br> It makes me uncomfortable.<br> I am Sayana.<br> You have a name? Yes, Spock.<br> I am Spock.<br> Spock? I fail to see what they find so amusing.<br> Come! This house is your house.<br> I will send you more food and drink.<br> You are welcome in the place of Vaal.<br> Now we're welcome.<br> A while ago this whole planet was trying to kill us.<br> - It doesn't make sense.<br> - Nothing makes sense down here.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> - Scott here.<br> Status report, Scotty.<br> No change, captain.<br> The orbit is decaying along computed lines.<br> No success with the warp drive.<br> We're going down and we can't stop it.<br> I'm sick of hearing that word, \"can't.<br>\" Get that ship out of there.<br> Sir, we're doing everything within engineering reason.<br> Then use your imagination.<br> Tie every ounce of power the ship has into the impulse engines.<br> Discard the warp-drive nacelles if you have to, and crack out with the main section, but get that ship out of there! I'm gonna switch over everything but the life-support systems and boost the impulse power, but that's just about as dangerous.<br> Do it.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Incredible.<br> - Report.<br> I just ran a thorough check on the natives, and there's a complete lack of harmful bacteria in their systems.<br> No decalcification, no degeneration of tissue, no arteriosclerosis.<br> In simple terms, Jim, they're not growing old.<br> And I can't begin to tell you how old they are.<br> Twenty years, or 20,000 years.<br> I see.<br> Opinion.<br> Quite possible.<br> It checks with my atmospheric analysis.<br> Their atmosphere completely negates any harmful effects from their sun.<br> Add to that a simple diet, perfectly controlled temperature, no natural enemies, apparently no vices, no replacements needed Maybe it is paradise after all.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Apparently our hypothesis is correct.<br> There is no living being there.<br> It is a machine, nothing more.<br> Well, the field's down, people are going in.<br> Let's see what kind of luck we have.<br> - That's not the way.<br> - Evidently not.<br> This is no ordinary machine, captain.<br> It may well possess a rudimentary intelligence.<br> But it needs to eat.<br> Frequently.<br> So it can't have any great power reserves.<br> That may not be of any help.<br> The Enterprise has only ten hours left in which to break free.<br> Yeah.<br> What happens if Vaal weakens around feeding time? Spock, check the electromagnetic section of the astrophysics lab.<br> Get an estimate of the total amount of energy being expended against the ship.<br> - Have them measure it hour by hour.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> What's going on, Jim? Mess call.<br> In my view, a splendid example of reciprocity.<br> It would take a computerised Vulcan mind such as yours to make that kind of a statement.<br> Doctor, you insist on applying human standards to non-human cultures.<br> I remind you that humans are only a tiny minority in this galaxy.<br> There are certain absolutes, Mr.<br> Spock, and one of them is the right of humanoids to a free and unchained environment.<br> The right to have conditions which permit growth.<br> Another is their right to choose a system which seems to work for them.<br> Jim, you're not just gonna stand by and be blinded to what's going on here? These are humanoids, intelligent.<br> They need to advance and grow.<br> Don't you understand what my readings indicate? There's been no change or progress here in at least 10,000 years.<br> This isn't life.<br> It's stagnation.<br> Doctor, these people are healthy and they are happy.<br> Whatever you choose to call it, this system works, despite your emotional reaction to it.<br> It might work for you, Mr.<br> Spock, but it doesn't work for me.<br> Humanoids living so they can service a hunk of tin.<br> Gentlemen, I think this philosophical argument can wait until our ship is out of danger.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Scotty, sir.<br> We have a reading on the power source Mr.<br> Spock requested.<br> When we first monitored, it was generating alternating cycles totalling 100 to the 20th power Wortham units.<br> Did it maintain, Scotty? No, sir.<br> Power's dropping bit by bit.<br> Nominal, but a definite drain.<br> Good.<br> Keep monitoring.<br> How are you coming along with the circuit switch-over? We're putting everything but the kitchen sink into impulse power.<br> It'll take us another eight hours to complete the work.<br> That's cutting it a bit fine, Scotty.<br> Aye.<br> But if we don't break out l'd rather we didn't have to wait too long for the end of it.<br> Kirk out.<br> Every time I think of the Enterprise burning up and us Yeoman, you're wasting energy.<br> - Captain, we're trapped - Sit down and have something to eat.<br> - The Enterprise is up there - That hasn't happened yet.<br> I wonder what would happen Yeoman, speculate.<br> What would happen if someone on this planet died? But they can't.<br> You said that Vaal takes care of them.<br> Accidents happen.<br> Yes.<br> I suppose if someone were to fall off a cliff or something, that might upset the balance of the population.<br> Then they would need a replacement.<br> They'd need a replacement.<br> Opinion, Mr.<br> Spock? I see no alternative.<br> But these people I mean, if they don't know anything about What I mean is, they don't seem to have any natural I mean, how is it done? Mr.<br> Spock, you're the science officer.<br> Why don't you explain it to the young lady? Well, I believe it's safe Safe to assume that they would receive the necessary instructions.<br> From a machine? That I'd like to see.<br> I understand, Vaal.<br> It shall be done.<br> You know, if it weren't for Vaal, this place would be a paradise.<br> Any place we can be together is paradise.<br> Pav, can the ship really break away? I don't know.<br> Will we be able to get back aboard? Martha, I don't know.<br> But if we do have to stay here, would it be so very bad? No, not if you're with me.<br> - Why do you look like that? - The way they touched I do not understand.<br> They were not angry.<br> I think it was pleasant for them.<br> But what is to be gained? It is not a dance.<br> It gathers no food.<br> It does not serve Vaal.<br> But it did seem as though it was pleasant to them.<br> It is pleasant, Makora.<br> Yes.<br> They touched in this way.<br> Vaal! He is angry.<br> The law is plain.<br> I have given you the words of Vaal.<br> Do you beg the lightning to strike? We saw the strangers, the two of them, do this thing.<br> - You copied them? - We meant no harm.<br> Vaal speaks truly to me.<br> The newcomers are a danger.<br> Tell the men of Vaal to meet me in the clear place when the strangers are asleep.<br> It is Vaal's own words.<br> Vaal has spoken to me.<br> His words are true.<br> Hear them.<br> We are to kill the strangers.<br> \"Kill,\" Akuta? We do not understand.<br> It is a thing to do, like feeding Vaal.<br> Vaal explained it to me.<br> I will show you.<br> This is the head of one of the strangers.<br> Find a heavy stick, come up from behind the stranger, and do this: It is a simple thing.<br> It is the word of Vaal.<br> It will be done, to all of them when the sun returns in the morning.<br> I am concerned, captain.<br> This may not be an ideal society, but it is a viable one.<br> Bones was right.<br> These people aren't living, they're existing.<br> They don't create, they don't produce, they don't even think.<br> They exist to service a machine.<br> If we do what it seems we must, in my opinion, we'll be in direct violation of the Non-lnterference Directive.<br> These are people, not robots.<br> They should have the opportunity of choice.<br> We owe it to them to interfere.<br> Starfleet Command may think otherwise.<br> I'll take my chances.<br> Why don't you have a look around? Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Here, sir.<br> - How's it going, Scotty? Almost ready, sir.<br> We'll need a half an hour yet.<br> You realise that within 45 minutes, the ship will be pulled down into the atmosphere.<br> I know that.<br> As you said, it's cutting things fine.<br> - Yes, l - Captain.<br> Kirk out.<br> - What is it? - Disturbing.<br> The People of Vaal seem to have disappeared.<br> Force field, captain.<br> Vaal.<br> We are on a peaceful mission.<br> We mean no harm to you or your people.<br> Variation in impulses, captain.<br> I believe it is reading us.<br> Strong jump on all wavelengths.<br> Let's get out of here! Bones! Second-degree burns.<br> Not serious, but I bet they smart.<br> Doctor, you have an unsurpassed talent for understatement.<br> Marple! Put them in the hut.<br> Find out where the women are, put them in there too.<br> The good doctor was concerned that the Vaalians achieve true human stature.<br> I submit there is no cause for worry.<br> They've taken the first step.<br> They've learned to kill.<br> We're ready here, sir.<br> All available power has been channelled into the impulse engines.<br> We have 12 minutes before entering atmosphere.<br> All right, Scotty, put her in full reverse.<br> Get her out of there.<br> Full reverse, Mr.<br> Kyle, all engines.<br> Sir! Captain, we're doing it, we're pulling away! Scotty, what happened? It's no good, sir.<br> There's only a few systems responding.<br> Captain, we pulled away a little.<br> We gained maybe an hour.<br> But we blew almost every system in the ship doing it.<br> There's nothing left to try again.<br> I guess you'll have to fire me, sir.<br> You're fired.<br> - Four hundred people.<br> - Jim.<br> They'll die because I couldn't see a warning sign.<br> I had to follow orders.<br> Always orders.<br> - Get back in there.<br> - Fine time to ring the dinner bell.<br> Get back in there.<br> Now.<br> - Bones, that's it.<br> - Get back in there.<br> Stay with Chekov.<br> Keep those people from feeding Vaal.<br> Don't let them feed Vaal.<br> Keep them in the hut.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Scotty, do you still have phaser power? - Aye, but what.<br>.<br>? - Lock all banks on the coordinates of the energy field down here.<br> On my command, commence firing on those coordinates.<br> Aye, sir, but they won't penetrate that force field.<br> If my guess is correct, they won't have to.<br> Stand by.<br> Vaal calls to us.<br> Let us go to him.<br> He hungers.<br> Please.<br> Readings are getting weaker, captain.<br> Wide variation in energy transmissions, as though Vaal were trying to draw on other sources.<br> - Tapping its energy cells? - I would assume so.<br> Good.<br> The ship's pulling away must have weakened it considerably.<br> It has to be fed, but its reserve capacity could hold out for days.<br> If it had to reinforce its energy field to ward off a phaser attack, it would have to draw more heavily on its reserves.<br> My plan exactly.<br> Scotty.<br> Scott here, sir.<br> Scotty, commence firing, and maintain.<br> Mr.<br> Kyle.<br> All phasers, commence firing.<br> Tremendous upsurge in generated power, captain.<br> Obviously, Vaal is trying to reinforce its energy field.<br> Good.<br> Let's see how long he can do it.<br> Scotty! Cease fire! No power generation at all, captain.<br> Vaal is dead.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, status report.<br> Tractor beam gone.<br> Potency returning to antimatter pods.<br> I'll have all engineering sections working on the circuits immediately.<br> Transporter will be ready in an hour.<br> Scotty, you're rehired.<br> As soon as the transporter's fixed, form an engineering detail with full analytical equipment and beam them down.<br> Kirk out.<br> Chekov.<br> Bones.<br> Let those people go.<br> But it was Vaal who put the fruit on the trees, caused the rain to fall.<br> Vaal cared for us.<br> You'll learn to care for yourselves, with our help.<br> And there's no trick to putting fruit on trees.<br> You might even enjoy it.<br> You'll learn to build for yourselves, think for yourselves, work for yourselves, and what you create is yours.<br> That's what we call freedom.<br> You'll like it, a lot.<br> And you'll learn something about men and women, the way they're supposed to be.<br> Caring for each other, being happy with each other.<br> Being good to each other.<br> That's what we call love.<br> You'll like that too, a lot.<br> You and your children.<br> What are children? Little ones.<br> Look like you.<br> They Just go on the way you're going, you'll find out.<br> I don't agree with you at all, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That's not unusual, doctor.<br> Hey, Jim, I want you to hear this.<br> Captain, I'm not at all certain we did the correct thing on Gamma Trianguli VI.<br> We put those people back on a normal course of social evolution.<br> I see nothing wrong in that.<br> Well, that's a good object lesson, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> An example of what can happen when a machine gets too efficient, does too much work for you.<br> Captain, you are aware of the biblical story of Genesis.<br> Yes, of course I'm aware of it.<br> Adam and Eve tasted the apple, and as a result, were driven out of paradise.<br> Precisely, captain.<br> And, in a manner of speaking, we have given the People of Vaal the apple, the knowledge of good and evil, if you will, as the result of which they, too, have been driven out of paradise.<br> Doctor, do I understand him correctly? Are you casting me in the role of Satan? Not at all, captain.<br> Is there anyone on this ship who even remotely looks like Satan? I am not aware of anyone who fits that description, captain.<br> No, Mr.<br> Spock, I didn't think you would be.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tDistress call definitely came from one of the solar systems in this sector, captain.<br> - Can you pinpoint it any closer? - Negative.<br> It was so badly garbled, all we got was the name \"Constellation.<br>\" - Then we lost it.<br> - Sir? We're now within the limits of System L370, but I can't seem to locate Captain, sensors show this entire solar system has been destroyed.<br> Nothing left but rubble and asteroids.<br> That's incredible.<br> The star in this system is still intact.<br> Only a nova could destroy like that.<br> Nonetheless, captain, sensors show nothing but debris where we charted seven planets last year.<br> - Continue search pattern.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Entering limits of System L374, sir.<br> Scanners show the same evidence of destruction.<br> Every solar system in this sector blasted to rubble, and still no sign of the Constellation.<br> Matt Decker's in command.<br> What could have happened? Captain, the two innermost planets of this system appear to be intact.<br> Sir, I'm picking up a ship's disaster beacon.<br> Try to raise her, lieutenant.<br> I have it on the sensors, captain.<br> By configuration, a starship.<br> Stopped in space, she appears to be drifting.<br> No answer, captain.<br> All I get is the automatic beacon.<br> Sensors not recording normal energy output.<br> Approach course, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> It's the Constellation.<br> - Look at that.<br> - She may have been wrecked by whatever destroyed these solar systems.<br> She was attacked.<br> Red alert! Red alert! Man your battle stations.<br> Red alert.<br> Red alert.<br> Man your battle stations.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - All phaser banks manned and ready.<br> Very good.<br> Initiate full sensor scan of the immediate area - for any other vessel.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Lieutenant Palmer.<br> I can't raise the Constellation, sir.<br> I'm still getting the distress beacon, but there's heavy subspace interference.<br> - It's almost blocking the signal.<br> - Keep trying.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, a full evaluation of the damage to the Constellation.<br> All power plants dead.<br> Reserve energy banks operative at a very low power level.<br> Life-support systems? Also operative at a low power level.<br> The entire Bridge is damaged and uninhabitable.<br> The rest of the ship seems able to sustain life.<br> - Radiation levels? - Normal.<br> But subspace interference makes readings difficult.<br> No other vessels in the area, captain.<br> All scanners show clear.<br> All hands, go to yellow alert.<br> Stand by battle stations.<br> Lieutenant, have Dr.<br> McCoy, Mr.<br> Scott and a damage-control party - report to me in the Transporter Room.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> We're going to board her.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you're in command.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Radiation level, normal.<br> Atmospheric pressure, Filtration systems are out, sir.<br> The whole communication system looks to be shorted out too.<br> Scotty, see if the phaser banks have been fired.<br> Bones, you come with me.<br> Come along, lad.<br> What a mess.<br> No clutter, no half-empty cups of coffee.<br> Whatever happened didn't happen without a warning.<br> What do you think did it, sir? I don't know, lad, but I want a full structural and control-damage check.<br> And I'm gonna have a look at those engines.<br> The crew wasn't abducted, they just left.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, Spock here.<br> No survivors.<br> No bodies either.<br> Is it possible they were beamed down to one of the two planets? Improbable, captain.<br> The surface temperature of the inner planet is that of molten lead.<br> The other has an atmosphere poisonous to human life.<br> We'll continue our search.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain, I checked the engines.<br> The warp drive, that's a hopeless pile of junk.<br> The impulse engines are not too badly off.<br> We'll be able - to do something with them.<br> - Phaser banks? Exhausted.<br> They didn't give up without a battle.<br> But where are they? I can't imagine a man like Matt Decker abandoning ship while his life-support systems are still operative.<br> The computer system is still intact.<br> We can play back the duplicate captain's log from the Auxiliary Control Room.<br> Matt.<br> Matt.<br> It's Jim Kirk.<br> Commodore? Commodore Decker? Matt.<br> Matt.<br> Kirk.<br> It's Jim Kirk.<br> What happened to your ship, Matt? A ship attacked That That thing.<br> - What thing? What was it? - That Answer me.<br> What was it? What happened, Matt? Jim, give him a minute.<br> He's in a state of shock.<br> Ready with the duplicate log, sir.<br> Go.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4202.<br> 1.<br> Exceptionally heavy subspace interference still prevents our contacting Starfleet to inform them of the destroyed solar systems we have encountered.<br> We are now entering System L374.<br> Science Officer Masada reports the fourth planet seems to be breaking up.<br> We are going to investigate.<br> The fourth planet.<br> Only two left now.<br> Scotty, pull the microtapes from the sensor memory banks and beam them to Spock.<br> I want a full analysis, a complete report of what happened on that planet.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - We tried to contact Starfleet.<br> No one heard.<br> No one.<br> - We couldn't run.<br> - What happened to your crew? Oh, I had to beam them down.<br> We were dead.<br> No power.<br> Our phasers, useless.<br> I stayed behind.<br> Last man.<br> The captain, last man aboard the ship.<br> That's what you're supposed to do, isn't it? And then it hit again and the transporter went out.<br> There they were down there, and I'm up here.<br> What hit? What attacked you? They say there's no devil, Jim.<br> But there is.<br> Right out of hell! I saw it! Matt, where's your crew? - On the third planet.<br> - There is no third planet.<br> Don't you think I know that? There was, but not anymore.<br> They called me.<br> They begged me for help, 400 of them.<br> I couldn't! I I couldn't.<br> Captain, Washburn has our report.<br> - Go.<br> - We made a complete check on structural and control damage, sir.<br> As far as we can tell, something crashed through the deflectors and knocked out the generators.<br> Somehow the antimatter in the warp-drive pods has been deactivated.<br> Deactivated.<br> Scotty, could some kind of general, energy-dampening field do that? And would the same type of thing account for the heavy subspace interference? Aye, it all adds up.<br> But what sort of a thing could do all that? If you'd seen it, you'd know.<br> The whole thing's a weapon, it must be.<br> - What does it look like? - Well, it's miles long, with a maw that could swallow a dozen starships.<br> It destroys planets, chops them into rubble.<br> What is it, an alien ship? Or is it alive or.<br>.<br>? Both.<br> Or neither.<br> I don't know.<br> Matt, your log stated that the fourth planet was breaking up.<br> - You went in to investigate.<br> - We saw it hovering over the planet, slicing out chunks of it with a force beam.<br> Did you run a scanner check on it? What kind of a beam? Pure antiproton.<br> Absolutely pure.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Spock here, captain.<br> Unable to raise Starfleet Command due to heavy subspace interference.<br> - Attempting to remedy.<br> - What about the Constellation's tapes? She was attacked by what appears to be essentially a robot.<br> An automated weapon of immense size and power.<br> Its apparent function is to smash planets to rubble and then digest the debris for fuel.<br> It is therefore self-sustaining, as long as there are planetary bodies for it to feed on.<br> A robot weapon that purposely destroys entire solar systems.<br> - Why? - Unknown, captain.<br> However, Mr.<br> Sulu has computed the path of the machine using the destroyed solar systems as a base course.<br> Projecting back on our star charts, we find that it came from outside, from another galaxy.<br> And what is the projected course of this thing? If it follows its present path, it will go through the most densely populated section of our galaxy.<br> Thank you.<br> Stand by, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Kirk out.<br> This whole thing's incredible.<br> A robot, a machine like that, who would build it? We don't know.<br> An alien race apparently from another galaxy.<br> But why? Bones, did you ever hear of a doomsday machine? No.<br> I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.<br> It's a weapon, built primarily as a bluff.<br> It's never meant to be used.<br> So strong it could destroy both sides in a war.<br> Something like the old H-bomb was supposed to be.<br> That's what I think this is.<br> A doomsday machine that somebody used in a war uncounted years ago.<br> They don't exist anymore but the machine is still destroying.<br> Oh, forget about your theories! That thing is on the way to the heart of our galaxy.<br> - What are you gonna do? - Take it easy.<br> First thing we're gonna do is get you back.<br> Oh, no, I stay here.<br> I'm not leaving my ship There's no ship to leave.<br> It's a dead hulk.<br> We'll take her in tow.<br> I'll stay onboard and get her ready.<br> You go back to the Enterprise with the doctor and let him help you.<br> It's just that I never lost a command before.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Have the Transporter Room beam Dr.<br> McCoy and Commodore Decker onboard immediately.<br> Red alert! Red alert! Come on.<br> It came up on us fast, captain, but we seem able to maintain our distance.<br> I'm blind here.<br> What's it look like? It looks very much like Commodore Decker's planet killer.<br> And it is pursuing us.<br> We are more manoeuvrable, but it is gaining on us.<br> Sensors indicate some kind of total conversion drive.<br> No evidence of life.<br> Subspace interference level incredibly high.<br> Whatever it is, we can't let it go beyond us to the next solar system.<br> We have to stop it.<br> If it's a robot, what are the chances of deactivating it? I would say none, captain.<br> The energy generated by our power nacelles seems to attract it.<br> I doubt we could manoeuvre close enough without drawing a direct attack upon ourselves.<br> I also believe the nature of this machine precludes the possibility of easy access to its control mechanisms.<br> - It's closing on us, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Closing, captain.<br> All right.<br> Lower your deflector screens long enough to beam us aboard.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Transporter Room, stand by to beam landing party aboard.<br> Ready to beam, sir.<br> Evasive action, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Damage report, all stations.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, the transporter's out.<br> - Effect repairs.<br> - Captain Kirk, come in, please.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Captain, we've been attacked.<br> Transporter is damaged.<br> We're taking evasive action.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, communication's damaged.<br> We're unable to override interference.<br> Damage in communications, captain.<br> Interference will Spock.<br> Spock.<br> Come in, Spock.<br> Spock? - We're stuck.<br> Blind and deaf.<br> - And paralyzed.<br> No power.<br> Well, we just can't stand around while our ship is being attacked.<br> You've got to get me some manoeuvring power.<br> I can't repair a warp drive without a space dock.<br> Then get me impulse power, half-speed, quarter-speed, anything.<br> If we can get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something.<br> The impulse engines are still in fair shape.<br> I might coax them.<br> - Then get moving.<br> - Come along, lad.<br> Washburn, you get in there.<br> Let's see what we can do about this viewing screen.<br> I've got to find out what's happening out there.<br> No casualties, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> How are we doing? We have outrun it, doctor.<br> Status report.<br> Impulse and warp engines operative.<br> Transporter and communications under repair.<br> Random chance seems to have operated in our favour.<br> In plain, non-Vulcan English, we've been lucky.<br> I believe I said that, doctor.<br> It's veering off.<br> Back on course for the next solar system.<br> The Rigel colonies, sir.<br> Evidently programmed to ignore anything as small as a ship beyond a certain radius.<br> We'll maintain a discreet distance and circle back to pick up the captain.<br> You can't let that thing reach Rigel.<br> Millions of innocent people would die.<br> I am aware of the Rigel system's population, commodore, but we are only one ship.<br> Our deflector shields are strained.<br> Our subspace transmitter is useless.<br> Logically, our primary duty is to survive in order to warn Starfleet Command.<br> Our primary duty is to maintain life and the safety of Federation planets.<br> Do you deny that? Mr.<br> Sulu, you will lay in an evasive course back to the Constellation.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Belay that last order, helmsman.<br> One hundred and eighty degree turn, hard about.<br> We're going to attack.<br> You will carry out my last order, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I am officially notifying you that I am exercising my option under regulations as a Starfleet commodore, and that I am assuming command of the Enterprise.<br> You have the right to do so, but I would advise against it.<br> That thing must be destroyed.<br> You tried to destroy it once before, commodore.<br> The result was a wrecked ship and a dead crew.<br> I made a mistake then.<br> We were too far away.<br> This time I'm going to hit it with full phasers at point-blank range.<br> Sensors show the object's hull is solid neutronium.<br> A single ship cannot combat it.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, that will be all.<br> You have been relieved of command.<br> Don't force me to relieve you of duty as well.<br> You can't let him do this, Spock.<br> Doctor, you are out of line.<br> So are you sir.<br> Well, Spock? Unfortunately, Starfleet Order 104, Section B, leaves me no alternative.<br> Paragraph 1 A clearly states To blazes with regulations! You can't let him take command when you know he's wrong.<br> If you can certify Commodore Decker medically or psychologically unfit for command, I can relieve him under Section C.<br> I'll certify that right now.<br> You will also be asked to produce your medical records to prove it.<br> Now, you know I haven't had time to run an examination on him.<br> Then your statement would not be considered valid.<br> You may leave the Bridge, doctor.<br> What about the captain? We can't leave Doctor, you may leave the Bridge.<br> Spock! Do something! Mr.<br> Spock knows his duty under regulations, doctor.<br> Do you? Hard about, helmsman.<br> Course: 32 degrees, mark 10.<br> Deflectors at full power.<br> Ready on main phaser banks.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Captain, the impulse engines' control circuits are fused solid.<br> What about the warp drive control circuits? Aye, we can cross-connect the controls, but the ship'll be almost impossible for one man to handle.<br> Worry about your miracles, Scotty, I'll worry about mine.<br> Get to work.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Washburn, try the 2G6 circuit.<br> Closing fast.<br> Deflector shields at full power.<br> They can't take much more of this.<br> Helmsman, hold your course.<br> Stand by, all phaser banks.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Deflectors holding, but weakening.<br> We must retreat, commodore.<br> - The energy drain - I'm in command here, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Maintain your course, helmsman.<br> Get us in closer.<br> - Ready to give it a try? - Just one minute, sir.<br> Scotty, how are you doing? Controls are all hooked up, sir.<br> We should have some power for you soon.<br> Try it now, captain.<br> Yes, I think What the devil's going on? Fire! Direct hit.<br> They just bounced off.<br> Commodore, I urgently recommend immediate withdrawal.<br> Recommendation noted.<br> Maintain course.<br> Fire! Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, come in.<br> Kirk to Enterpri Scotty, where's that power? Coming, sir.<br> If I push these impulse engines too hard in the condition they're in, they'll blow apart.<br> Washburn, go down to Engineering, assist Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Scotty, push it right to the edge.<br> This ship has got to manoeuvre.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Sir, deflector shields are gone.<br> Sir, Deck 7 reports power failure in main energisers.<br> Implementing emergency procedures.<br> Severe casualties reported on Decks 3 and 4.<br> Damage-control party sealing off inner-hull rupture.<br> It has ceased fire.<br> We're being held in a tractor beam.<br> We're being pulled inside, commodore.<br> You must veer off.<br> Maintain phaser fire, helmsman.<br> We have lost warp power.<br> If we don't break the tractor beam within 60 seconds, we never will.<br> But don't you understand? We've got to destroy it! That, sir, is illogical.<br> It is suicide.<br> Attempted suicide would be proof that you are psychologically unfit for command.<br> If you don't veer off, I shall relieve you on that basis.<br> - Veer off! - Emergency impulse power.<br> - We can't break loose.<br> - We need more power.<br> We haven't got it! We're being pulled inside.<br> Scotty, give me that power.<br> You've got it, captain.<br> Just enough to move us.<br> I can't do better.<br> That'll do.<br> Full ahead, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> That's it, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Keep that power coming.<br> - Full power astern.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> We still can't move.<br> Keep pouring it on, Scotty.<br> Captain, I still don't know what we're doing.<br> We're moving.<br> The Enterprise isn't.<br> Maybe that thing will see us and let the Enterprise go.<br> If I only had some phasers.<br> Phasers? You've got them.<br> I have one bank recharged.<br> Scotty, you've just earned your pay for the week.<br> Stand by.<br> Fire phasers.<br> We're loose, commodore.<br> Good boy, Jim.<br> Between the two of us, we'll kill that thing.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, it worked.<br> Great! I think it's great.<br> Scotty, get us out of here.<br> It's closing fast on the Constellation.<br> Standing by, sir.<br> Commodore, I suggest Kirk pulled us out of there by distracting it.<br> Now it's our turn.<br> Fire phasers.<br> Did it! Hard about.<br> Get me some distance.<br> We're moving away, commodore.<br> This machine seems to have a programmed defensive sphere.<br> Any energy source entering that field is subject to attack.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, status report.<br> Warp drive and deflectors will be out for a solar day.<br> Repairs proceeding on transporter and communications.<br> - It's closing with us again, sir.<br> - Maintain speed and distance.<br> It's sucking in space rubble from those destroyed planets, refuelling itself.<br> We can maintain this speed for seven hours before we exhaust our fuel, but it can refuel itself indefinitely.<br> Then we'll have to fight it now, before it gets any stronger.<br> Illogical.<br> We cannot destroy it, therefore, we cannot save Rigel.<br> We must transport the captain and the others from the Constellation, and escape this thing's subspace interference in order to warn Starfleet Command.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we've pierced the interference locally.<br> Can you raise Starfleet? No, sir, but I've got ship-to-ship communications back.<br> Picking up Captain Kirk.<br> - On audio, lieutenant.<br> - Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I am still in command and I will speak for this ship.<br> Enterprise to Kirk.<br> Commodore Decker speaking.<br> Matt? What's going on? Give me Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - I'm in command here, Jim.<br> - What happened to Spock? Nothing.<br> I assumed command according to regulations.<br> Since your first officer was reluctant to take aggressive action against the So you're the lunatic who's responsible for almost destroying my ship? You are speaking to a senior officer, Kirk.<br> - Give me Spock.<br> - I told you, I am in command here, according to every rule in the book, captain.<br> If you have anything to say at all, you will say it to me.<br> There's only one thing I wanna say to you, commodore: Get my ship out of there! Mr.<br> Spock? Ship status.<br> Commodore? Down here.<br> Warp drive out.<br> Deflector shields down.<br> Transporter under repair.<br> We are on emergency impulse power.<br> - How long to repair warp drive? - At least one solar day.<br> At our present rate of consumption, we'll exhaust our impulse power long before then.<br> - It's gaining on us, sir.<br> - Take evasive action, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> I told you, I am in command here, and I will give the orders, captain.<br> We are going to turn and attack.<br> Not with my ship, you don't.<br> Spock, relieve Commodore Decker immediately.<br> That's a direct order.<br> You can't relieve me and you know it.<br> According to regulations Blast regulations.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I order you to assume command on my personal authority as captain of the Enterprise.<br> Commodore Decker, you are relieved of command.<br> I don't recognise your authority to relieve me.<br> You may file a formal protest with Starfleet Command, assuming we survive to reach a starbase.<br> But you are relieved.<br> Commodore, I do not wish to place you under arrest.<br> You wouldn't dare.<br> You're bluffing.<br> Vulcans never bluff.<br> No.<br> No, I don't suppose that they do.<br> Very well, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The Bridge is yours.<br> Captain, I have assumed command.<br> Good.<br> Now, Mr.<br> Spock One moment, sir.<br> Commodore, I believe you were scheduled for medical examination.<br> - Mr.<br> Montgomery.<br> - Sir? Accompany the commodore to Sickbay.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Commodore.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Change course: Mark 21, sir.<br> Captain, we are taking an evasive course back to you.<br> We will try to stay ahead of the object until we can transport you aboard.<br> Fine.<br> Just make sure you stay ahead of it.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Yeah, Scotty? I've hooked in ship's communication.<br> The best I can give you on impulse is one-third power.<br> The shields are up, but they won't last long.<br> Keep it going, Scotty.<br> Keep her going.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'm plotting an intercept course.<br> We'll rendezvous with you at 1413.<br>7 hours.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, someone's opening the shuttlecraft bay doors.<br> - Shut them, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - It's too late, sir.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Why are you launching a shuttlecraft? Whoever it is, captain, has no authorisation.<br> Lieutenant, raise the shuttlecraft.<br> Enterprise to shuttlecraft.<br> Come in, shuttlecraft.<br> Enterprise to shuttlecraft.<br> Come in, shuttlecraft.<br> Come in, shuttlecraft.<br> Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.<br> Decker here.<br> Commodore, I must insist that you return to the ship.<br> You said it yourself, Spock.<br> There is no way to blast through the hull of that machine, so I'm gonna take this thing right down its throat.<br> This is Kirk.<br> Matt, you'll be killed.<br> I've been prepared for death ever since I Ever since I killed my crew.<br> No one expects you to die for an error in judgement.<br> A commander is responsible for the lives of his crew.<br> And for their deaths.<br> Well, I should have died with mine.<br> You cannot succeed, commodore.<br> Your only logical alternative is to return to the ship.<br> Matt.<br> Matt, listen to me.<br> You can't throw your life away like this.<br> Matt, you're a starship commander.<br> That makes you a valuable commodity.<br> We need you, your experience, your judgement.<br> Matt! We're stronger with you than without you.<br> He's gone.<br> Constellation, come in, please.<br> Captain Kirk, come in, please.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Sir, may I offer my condolences on the death of your friend? It is most regrettable.<br> It's regrettable that he died for nothing.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, sensors indicate a minute drop in the machine's power emanations.<br> Do you think the shuttlecraft explosion might have done some damage? What about that, Spock? Is it possible? The drop in power is definite, captain, but negligible.<br> The object is still pursuing us, thereby causing us to drain our power reserve at a much greater rate.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the transporter is now operational.<br> Transporter operational, captain.<br> Shall we beam you aboard? Negative.<br> Mr.<br> Scott and I will stay here, but beam the damage-control party aboard.<br> Captain, there is little to be gained by staying aboard the Constellation.<br> Except possibly the destruction of that thing out there.<br> Carry out your orders, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Transporter Room, beam damage-control party aboard.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Spock, listen.<br> Maybe Matt Decker didn't die for nothing.<br> He had the right idea, but not enough power to do it.<br> Am I correct in assuming that a fusion explosion of 97 megatons will result if a starship impulse engine is overloaded? No, sir, 97.<br>835 megatons.<br> Will it be powerful enough to destroy that thing out there? Negative, captain.<br> Its hull is pure neutronium.<br> There is no known way of blasting through it.<br> Not through it, Spock, from inside it.<br> Will it be enough? Insufficient data.<br> I shall try to take further sensor readings.<br> Do the best you can, and make it fast.<br> - Kirk to Scott.<br> - Here, sir.<br> The damage-control party just beamed back to the Enterprise.<br> Good.<br> Scotty, can you set the ship's impulse engines to overload? Aye.<br> The shape the thing's in, it's hard to keep it from blowing.<br> I want you to rig a 30-second-delay detonation device.<br> And rig it so that it can be blown from up here.<br> Aye, sir.<br> - Set it and get up here fast.<br> - Right away.<br> Captain.<br> The object's neutronium hull makes sensor readings of the inner mechanism impossible.<br> - Spock, you don't know? - Correct.<br> Captain, you're getting dangerously close to the planet killer.<br> I intend to get a lot closer.<br> I'm gonna ram her right down that thing's throat.<br> Jim, you'll be killed, just like Decker.<br> No.<br> No, I don't intend to die, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We've rigged a delayed-detonation device.<br> You'll have 30 seconds to beam me aboard the Enterprise before the Constellation's impulse engines blow.<br> Your chances of survival are not promising.<br> We don't even know if the explosion will be powerful enough.<br> - A calculated risk, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - There's another factor, captain.<br> The transporter is not working at 100 percent efficiency.<br> Thirty seconds is very slim timing.<br> A chance I'll have to take.<br> Kirk out.<br> A cranky transporter's a mighty finicky piece of machinery to be gambling your life on, sir.<br> What about the detonator? I've linked it in with the impulse control system.<br> It's armed now.<br> Press this one, 30 seconds later, poof! Once it's activated, there's no way to stop it.<br> Understood.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, prepare to beam Scotty onboard.<br> Transporter, stand by.<br> - Good luck, captain.<br> - Thank you.<br> What's the matter with that thing? It's a power drain somewhere, sir.<br> I almost lost you.<br> It'll never work like this.<br> It's the main junction circuitry.<br> I'll get it.<br> Bridge.<br> Transporter malfunction.<br> The transporter is out, captain.<br> You'll have to stand by.<br> I can't.<br> Power level's dropping too fast.<br> - He'd better hurry.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, speed is of the essence.<br> He's 2,000 miles from the planet killer and closing fast.<br> Bridge.<br> Transporter operational, but this jury-rigging won't last for long.<br> He's got to come off now.<br> - I'll stand by here.<br> - Fifteen hundred miles and closing.<br> Captain, transporter operational, but just barely.<br> Prepare to beam me aboard on my signal.<br> One thousand miles and closing.<br> - Transporter, stand by.<br> - Standing by, sir.<br> Five hundred miles and closing.<br> - Beam me aboard.<br> - Energise.<br> Energising.<br> Bridge, it shorted out again.<br> Gentlemen, beam me aboard.<br> We can't, captain.<br> Transporter is out again.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, 20 seconds to detonation.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, try inverse phasing.<br> Sixteen, 15, 14, 13 Gentlemen, I suggest you beam me aboard.<br> Ten, nine, eight, - Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Seven, six, Try her now, Mr.<br> Kyle.<br> Five, four Bridge! We got him through! Energy output, zero.<br> Radiation level, normal.<br> Welcome aboard, captain.<br> Sensors show all energy sources deactivated.<br> It's quite dead.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, ease us back to minimum headway.<br> Conserve power as much as possible.<br> Lieutenant Palmer, tell Mr.<br> Scott to expedite repairs on the warp drive.<br> Poor Matt, he gave his life in an attempt to save others.<br> - Not the worst way to go.<br> - Indeed, captain.<br> I presume your log will show that Decker died in the line of duty.<br> Indeed it shall, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Ironic, isn't it? Way back in the 20th century, the H-bomb was the ultimate weapon, their doomsday machine.<br> And we used something like it to destroy another doomsday machine.<br> Probably the first time such a weapon has ever been used for constructive purposes.<br> Appropriate, captain.<br> However, I can't help wondering if there are any more of those weapons wandering around the universe.<br> Well, I certainly hope not.<br> I found one quite sufficient.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Lieutenant, can you hear me? Whatever this stuff is, it's getting thicker.<br> Do you suppose it has anything to do with the interference? No.<br> There has to be some explanation for the fact the ship's sensors can't register anything but us, while we're picking up readings for multiple life forms.<br> - Are they still there, Spock? - No change, captain.<br> Standby alert.<br> Listen.<br> - What do you think that - Quiet.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> - Who are you? - Go back.<br> Remember the curse Winds shall rise And the fog descend So leave here, all Or meet your end! Spock, comment.<br> Very bad poetry, captain.<br> A more useful comment, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> What we've just seen is not real.<br> That's useful.<br> However, on Azimuth 24, at just over 100 metres, there are definitely life forms.<br> Erratic, confused but definitely registering.<br> - That's where we go.<br> That was a pretty real illusion, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Jim.<br> This is the source of the life form readings, captain.<br> They're inside somewhere.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Isn't that how we lost contact with the first landing party? What about it, Spock? Does this structure have anything to do with communicator interference? I would say not, captain.<br> There's no indication of anything that would cause such interference.<br> And it doesn't pick up on our ship's sensors.<br> Nor do our sensors register the life forms inside.<br> It could be exerting a force field of some kind that cuts into our sensor scan.<br> Then it would affect Spock's tricorder too, wouldn't it? Would it? I wonder.<br> Three witches what appears to be a castle, and a black cat.<br> If we weren't missing two officers, and a third one dead, I'd say someone was playing an elaborate trick-or-treat on us.<br> - Trick-or-treat, captain? - Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You'd be a natural.<br> I'll explain it to you one day.<br> - Shall we have a look around? - That would seem to be in order.<br> Bones.<br> Spock.<br> They're gone, Mr.<br> DeSalle.<br> The captain and the others.<br> Simply stopped registering.<br> Check for malfunctions.<br> - I did, sir, as soon as it happened.<br> - Mr.<br> DeSalle that's exactly what happened to Mr.<br> Scott and his party.<br> - They just disappeared.<br> - Nobody just disappears.<br> They may have encountered a magnetic field or some other obstruction.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, recalibrate your sensors.<br> - If you need help - I can do it, sir.<br> I'm not that green.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, continue your efforts to break through that static interference.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> We know they're down there.<br> I want them found.<br> - Straight ahead, Mr.<br> Spock? - The readings would so indicate.<br> Dust, cobwebs.<br> Halloween is right.<br> Spock are you all right? - Yes.<br> I am undamaged, captain.<br> Bones.<br> Doc.<br> You were saying something about trick-or-treat.<br> Dungeons curses.<br> Skeletons and iron maidens.<br> They're all Earth manifestations.<br> - Why? - I do not know, captain.<br> But these things do exist.<br> They are real.<br> Could this be an Earth parallel development of some sort? None of this parallels any human development.<br> It's more like a human nightmare.<br> - As if someone knew what it was that terrifies man most on an instinctive level.<br> Ghost stories, ogres, demons.<br> The whole Scotty, Sulu.<br> Scotty put down the phaser.<br> They appear to be drugged, captain.<br> Look at their eyes.<br> They hardly blink at all.<br> Neither did Jackson, just before he collapsed.<br> These two are alive.<br> Scotty, do you hear me? Sulu, do you know who I am? What's happened to you? I think they're going to release us.<br> Stop! Whoever you are you've proven your skill at creating illusions.<br> Now I want to know why, and what you've done to my men.<br> Where did your race get this ridiculous predilection for resistance? You examine any object, you question everything.<br> Is it not enough to accept what is? Not when one of my men is dead because of it, - and two others turned into mindless - Not mindless.<br> These two are merely controlled, Captain Kirk.<br> Yes, we know who you are.<br> All of you.<br> Don't we, my precious? Who are you? Why did you bring us here? My name is Korob.<br> And as for bringing you here it was you who quite contrarily insisted upon coming.<br> - You were warned to stay away.<br> - But why? For what reason? Why all the mumbo jumbo? Mumbo jumbo? No, I assure you it was not that, captain.<br> Mapping expeditions have charted this solar system before.<br> There never have been any life forms on Pyris Vll.<br> It is of no importance that we are not native to this planet.<br> I'm told I've been an inattentive host, gentlemen.<br> You will join me for something to refresh yourselves? - That cat.<br> - That cat.<br> There are ancient Earth legends about wizards and their familiars.<br> Familiars? Demons in animal forms, sent by Satan to serve the wizard.<br> Superstition.<br> I do not create the legend, captain.<br> I merely report it.<br> You are the different one, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You do not think like the others.<br> There are no colours to your patterns of logic.<br> There's only black and white.<br> You see all this around you and yet you do not believe.<br> - He doesn't know about trick-or-treat.<br> I do not understand that reference.<br> Therefore it also is of no importance.<br> Gentlemen, I can be most hospitable.<br> - Ingenious.<br> - Do be seated.<br> - We're not hungry.<br> - But I insist.<br> All right, Korob.<br> What do you want from us? For the moment, merely that you eat and enjoy yourselves.<br> Doctor, do try the wine.<br> You'll find it excellent.<br> You'll find us most uncooperative unless you start explaining yourself.<br> Hopefully I can change that attitude.<br> - These look real.<br> - They are, I assure you.<br> Diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires.<br> All the crystalline forms you cherish above all things.<br> A fortune of them for each of you, if you will leave here without further enquiry.<br> We could manufacture a ton of these on our ship for you.<br> - They mean nothing to us.<br> - Valueless? I don't understand.<br> I read Whatever it is you read, you read it wrong.<br> As for leaving, we'll leave when we're ready.<br> You are most unpredictable.<br> Perhaps I have made a small mistake.<br> Nevertheless, you have passed the tests.<br> - Tests? - Yes.<br> Our analysis of you may have been, in some small way, in error but you were warned to stay away, and yet you came to save your comrades.<br> That proves loyalty.<br> Your bravery was tested, and you did not frighten.<br> And despite my failure with these bright baubles, I perceive you cannot be bribed.<br> In many ways, you are quite admirable.<br> Quite right.<br> Go at once, yes.<br> Gentlemen, my colleague, Sylvia.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, Mr.<br> Spock and Captain Kirk.<br> You wanted to know what we did to your men.<br> Actually, it's a simple matter for us to probe the minds of creatures like yourself.<br> Mind-probing.<br> Hypnosis? You like to think of yourselves as complex creatures, but you're flawed.<br> One gains admittance to your minds through many levels.<br> You have too many to keep track of yourselves.<br> There are unguarded entrances to any human mind.<br> Telepathy? Not entirely, no.<br> Telepathy doesn't imply control and I assure you that I have full control of your friends.<br> Don't move.<br> Cover them.<br> Now, I want the rest of our weapons and our equipment.<br> - I want some answers.<br> - Put that weapon down.<br> Captain, it seems so foolish of you to insist on demonstrations.<br> In the mythology of your race, this is called \"sympathetic magic\".<br> Jackson, the crew member who returned to the ship.<br> You wondered what killed him.<br> I made an image of him.<br> In the essence of my thoughts, the image was Jackson.<br> And when I killed the image and knew that it was dead he died.<br> You can't think a man to death.<br> Your communicator.<br> Now signal your ship.<br> Don't.<br> Sylvia, don't! Kirk to Enterprise, come in.<br> Come in.<br> - Enterprise, I'm Captain Kirk.<br> Come in.<br> - Captain.<br> Are you all right? Where are you? Are the others all right, sir? Never mind about us.<br> What's happening up there? The temperature, sir.<br> It keeps rising.<br> Reading, mister.<br> It's up 60 degrees in the past 30 seconds.<br> We're burning up, sir.<br> DeSalle channel bypass power into your heat dissipation units.<br> I've already done it, captain.<br> It had no effect.<br> - We're cooking up here.<br> - All right.<br> I'll handle it down here.<br> Kirk out.<br> You've won.<br> You can relax now, captain.<br> Your ship is safe.<br> The temperature is almost back to normal dropping down fast.<br> Lieutenant, try to raise the captain again.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Come in, please.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Acknowledge.<br> We've lost him again, Mr.<br> DeSalle.<br> Captain, you've seen something of our science, now tell us about yours.<br> You seem to be singing a different tune.<br> I'd rather know more about yours.<br> You call it \"magic,\" you call it \"science\".<br> It seems to be unrelated to both of them.<br> - What would you name it, captain? - I wouldn't attempt to name it.<br> But you seem to do with your mind what we do with tools.<br> You alter matter, move it about by telekinesis.<br> - Yes, we can change the molecular - Korob, you talk too much! You kept Scott and Sulu as catspaws to lure us down here.<br> - How'd you know we'd come? - We didn't have to know.<br> - They knew.<br> - Enough of this.<br> You will tell us what we want to know.<br> It's too late for threats.<br> You let me contact the ship.<br> How long do you think it will be before a search party arrives? Some time, captain.<br> Quite some time.<br> There will be no search party, Captain Kirk.<br> An impenetrable force field around your ship, captain.<br> It will not hinder orbit, but your people are prisoners within it.<br> It's some kind of a force field, sir.<br> But not like any other I've heard of before.<br> It's not coming from anywhere it's simply all around us.<br> I would advise you to cooperate, captain.<br> Forcible extraction of the information we wish from you is not complicated, but it is extremely painful.<br> And it has a certain - draining effect.<br> - We have nothing to discuss.<br> Take them to their cell.<br> Wait.<br> The doctor will stay.<br> Your turn will be next, captain.<br> It makes little difference.<br> Take them out of here.<br> Wavelength analysis, Mr.<br> Chekov? It will not analyse, sir.<br> All right.<br> But it's there, and it's real.<br> If it's real, it can be affected.<br> Engineering, standby to divert all power systems to the outer hull.<br> Prepare impulse engines for generation of maximum heat directed as ordered.<br> Maybe we can't break it, but I'll bet you credits to navy beans we can put a dent in it.<br> How long has it been? - 22 minutes,17 seconds.<br> - Thanks.<br> I wonder what they're doing to Doc.<br> I'm sure we'll find out shortly.<br> Jim all these things that we've seen to an Earthman like yourself they must seem quite familiar.<br> Familiar.<br> Startling not rational.<br> - Precisely.<br> I refer you to the psychological theory of the racial subconscious.<br> - The universal myths, symbols.<br> - Ghosts, witches, you mean? And dungeons, and castles, and black cats.<br> They all belong to the twilight world of consciousness.<br> - They tried to tap our conscious mind.<br> - And they missed.<br> They reach basically only the subconscious.<br> Korob seemed quite puzzled by your reaction to the environment he had provided.<br> He expected me to react as though it were all normal.<br> He admitted they weren't native to this planet.<br> And not to have a knowledge of our scientific methods is most unlikely, for any life form we've met in this galaxy.<br> They refer to us as \"creatures\" as though we were some species they were unfamiliar with.<br> If we're creatures I wonder what they're really like? Evidently something totally alien in all respect.<br> Agreed.<br> Totally alien.<br> I don't like hostile strangers showing such an acute interest in our galaxy, our world, Spock.<br> Not at all like friendly visitors.<br> We're going to have to stop them.<br> Cold.<br> But at the moment I too, am at a loss at this time to suggest a course of action.<br> Bones.<br> Doc.<br> You forget what we were sent here for.<br> I forget nothing.<br> I'm not a puppet, Korob, like you.<br> - You're a traitor! - You are a fool! We have nothing like this.<br> And I like it.<br> To touch, to feel, to understand the idea of luxury.<br> I like it and I don't intend to leave it.<br> - We have a duty to the Old Ones.<br> - What do they know of sensations! - This is a new world.<br> - You're cruel.<br> You torture our specimens.<br> And that too, is a new sensation.<br> I find it stimulating.<br> You're wrong! You're discarding everything we live by.<br> I live by my own decisions.<br> You're a weak fool, Korob.<br> - I have the power.<br> - But you're afraid to use it.<br> Don't threaten me.<br> I can squash you, and that would be an interesting sensation, yes.<br> I find I like these new sensations.<br> Don't try to push me.<br> Captain it's time for our talk.<br> Korob, leave us alone and take these men with you.<br> This is not ended, Sylvia.<br> But it may end soon, old man.<br> What now? Do you wave your magic wand and destroy my mind too? There's no real damage to the mind, Captain.<br> - Simply a drain of knowledge and will.<br> - You don't call that damage? Why should I? You'd know if you had compassion.<br> A woman should have compassion.<br> - But I forget you're not a woman.<br> - But you're mistaken, Captain.<br> I am a woman now.<br> I come from a world without sensation as you and I now know it.<br> It excites me.<br> I want more.<br> You seem to need us.<br> Why? Because you have knowledge which I lack.<br> But were our abilities put together Tell me about power, captain.<br> How does it feel? What about Korob? He is a fool.<br> I'll do without him.<br> But you why do I find you different? Why would it be so difficult to dispose of you? Why don't you simply probe my mind and get what you want? No.<br> Not that, not for you.<br> What I want is is a joining.<br> My mind to yours, willingly.<br> Think of the secrets you could learn, think of the power that would be yours.<br> Anything you can imagine, I can give you.<br> You're very persuasive.<br> What happens if I go along? Then everything would be ours together.<br> I've never conceived of the idea of togetherness before.<br> It excites me.<br> You excite me.<br> Why? For the same reasons you excite me.<br> You're a very beautiful woman.<br> You find me beautiful.<br> But I can be many women.<br> You like what you see? Or do you prefer me as I was? You have a knack for giving me difficult choices.<br> You have nothing like that where you come from? Nothing.<br> Your people, when they come here They're like feathers in the wind, without the transmuter.<br> - The transmuter? - The source.<br> You will learn.<br> I will teach you later.<br> Then it's a device.<br> You do use tools.<br> It gives only form.<br> You are teaching me substance.<br> You haven't changed your mind.<br> You won't return home.<br> My home is here with you.<br> A billion worlds of sensation to pick and choose.<br> You are using me! You hold me in your arms, and there is no fire in your mind! You're trying to deceive me.<br> It's here, like words on a page! - You were using me.<br> - Why not? You've been using me and my crew.<br> You will be swept away.<br> You, your men, your ship, your worlds! - I don't see any change.<br> - It's there, lieutenant.<br> It was that electrical field we set up, Mr.<br> DeSalle.<br> That dent you wanted.<br> It's not much, but it is a start.<br> Keep it up, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Channel the entire output of reactors one, two and three, into the relay stations.<br> Whatever it is, it's starting to weaken.<br> I have released the model of your ship from the crystal.<br> Although they would have freed themselves soon.<br> It is difficult to control so many things in so little time.<br> Here you must go before she finds the weapon is missing.<br> - I'm not leaving without my men.<br> - They're not your men anymore.<br> They belong to Sylvia.<br> I can no longer control them or her.<br> She's irrational.<br> It's the strain of adopting to your form.<br> The insatiable desire for sensation and experience.<br> She's a great danger.<br> And it was not necessary.<br> We could have entered your galaxy in peace.<br> - You came in a ship? - We used a transmuter.<br> Transmuter.<br> Yes, she mentioned that.<br> There's no time to explain now.<br> She means to destroy us all.<br> There may still be a chance.<br> Quickly.<br> Come.<br> Fascinating.<br> - Why a cat? - Racial memories.<br> The cat is the most ruthless, most terrifying of animals.<br> As far back as the sabre-toothed tiger.<br> I think I can stop her.<br> You'd better let us.<br> It's out of energy.<br> She must have drained it.<br> We could've jumped Scott and Sulu any time, if we'd known.<br> - No way out.<br> - That's my problem.<br> She's one of my kind.<br> Come quickly.<br> - You think you can make it? - Ready when you are, captain.<br> Get ready.<br> No! Get back! Get back! Get back! - Korob, the door won't last.<br> - Get back! Go.<br> Go! Quickly, captain.<br> Korob seemed to think this was important.<br> He said something about a transmuter.<br> Captain, a bit more alacrity, if you please.<br> Captain.<br> Doc.<br> Jim! - At least we found them.<br> - Fortuitous, captain.<br> And now that we have them all together? A most unpleasant situation, captain.<br> If only your phaser had some power.<br> Maybe we do.<br> Sylvia I have the transmuter.<br> It's mine now.<br> You're very clever, captain.<br> More so than I'd imagined.<br> Clever, resourceful, - and handsome.<br> - Don't let her touch the wand, captain.<br> Jim! - Don't you get tired of these games? - I've never played games.<br> Give it to me.<br> I wasn't sure before, but I am now.<br> This is the source of your power, the transmuter.<br> No, not the source.<br> It's merely an amplifier, a director.<br> The mind is the source.<br> Mine is simple.<br> But yours has the key.<br> - But you don't know how to use it.<br> - I catch on quickly.<br> It's not too late, Captain James Kirk.<br> Come with me.<br> - I'll teach you, you'll teach me.<br> - Why? Do your people have nothing of their own? Is that why you need us? We need your dreams, your ambition.<br> With them I can build.<br> - Give me the transmuter.<br> - No.<br> You fool! Don't you know what you're giving up? Everything that your species finds desirable.<br> Look at me! I am a woman.<br> I am all women! I don't know what you are, but you're not a woman.<br> You've tortured my men and taken their minds from them.<br> You ask for love and return pain instead.<br> Korob was wrong.<br> I didn't destroy all your weapons.<br> Give me the transmuter.<br> Give it to me! - What happened, Jim? - That'll take some explaining, Bones.<br> - Everything's vanished.<br> - Not everything.<br> Korob and Sylvia as they really are.<br> Their forms were an illusion, just like the castle and everything else.<br> Only the power-pack gave them reality.<br> Fascinating.<br> A life form totally alien to our galaxy.<br> If we could preserve and study this.<br> Too late.<br> All of this, just an illusion.<br> No illusion.<br> Jackson is dead.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> - Standing by, captain.<br> - Five to beam up.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Turning on 307 degrees, mark 8.<br> Being executed now, sir.<br> Take care of him.<br> - Security to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Lieutenant Rowe, sir.<br> I'm in Auxiliary Control.<br> Ensign Jordan's been knocked out.<br> The directional master controls have been jammed.<br> They're totally unworkable.<br> - Any sign of the intruder? - No, sir.<br> He's gone.<br> I've put out a full security alert on all decks.<br> Find him.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we seem to be taking an unscheduled ride.<br> Interesting.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Cut into Emergency Manual Monitor.<br> I want the override broken.<br> Sir, the instruments won't respond.<br> Emergency Manual Monitor, report.<br> This is Captain Kirk.<br> Acknowledge.<br> Emergency Manual Monitor.<br> This is the captain, report.<br> Here, you're not allowed Acknowledge.<br> This is the captain.<br> Scotty, acknowledge.<br> Scotty, what's going on down there? Kirk to Engineering.<br> This is the captain.<br> Scotty, report! Scotty, the intruder is in your area.<br> What's going on down there? Scotty! - Captain.<br> He's here.<br> - Scotty.<br> Scotty.<br> Scotty? Security.<br> The intruder's in Engineering.<br> Have all units converge on that point.<br> Sir, we're picking up speed.<br> Warp 5, 6.<br> Warp 7, sir.<br> Cut power.<br> I can't, sir.<br> All the controls are jammed.<br> Spock, take over.<br> It will not be necessary, captain.<br> Tell Security we found the intruder.<br> You mind telling me what this is all about, mister? I am in total control of your ship.<br> I have connected the matter-antimatter pods to the main navigational bank.<br> A trigger relay is now in operation.<br> Any attempts to alter course will result in the immediate destruction of this vessel.<br> Spock? Confirmed, captain.<br> He's taken out all the override controls.<br> If we tamper without knowing where the trigger relay is we could extinguish ourselves.<br> Who are you? I assure you, we are no threat to humanity or humanoid life.<br> We mean you no harm.<br> But we require your ship.<br> You require.<br>.<br>? Who and what are \"we\"? Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> - An android.<br> - And most sophisticated.<br> I control the trigger relay, sir.<br> I cannot be overcome by physical means.<br> And if you attempt to use your phasers, the trigger relay will be activated.<br> We shall continue on our present course for approximately four solar days, at which time we shall arrive at our destination.<br> Who sent you? I am not programmed to respond in that area.<br> He simply appears to have turned himself off, captain.<br> And since we cannot repair the damage he has done without destroying the ship It seems we're going to take a little trip.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4513.<br>3.<br> After having been taken over by an android, the Enterprise has been under way at warp 7 for four days.<br> Now, we are entering orbit around a planet which has never been charted.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> The following individuals will be transported down to our planet: Yourself, science officer, medical officer, communications officer, and navigator.<br> Any meetings or discussions can be held aboard the Enterprise.<br> If you do not come with me, your engines will be destroyed and you will remain in orbit here forever.<br> I must say, that's a gracious invitation.<br> There is a word.<br> Among us, there is no corresponding meaning.<br> But it seems to mean something to you humans.<br> And what is that word? Please.<br> Our planet's surface is what you classify as K-type.<br> Adaptable for humans by use of pressure domes and life-support systems.<br> - I have brought them.<br> - He is waiting.<br> If you will follow us, please.<br> I don't believe it.<br> Welcome aboard, Kirk.<br> Been a long time, eh? Harry Mudd! Well, to be absolutely accurate, laddie buck, you should refer to me as Mudd the First, ruler of this entire sovereign planet.<br> Ruler? I want control of my ship returned immediately.<br> We have no intention of staying.<br> Well, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem there.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Alice.<br> Now, now, Jamie boy, let's have no unauthorised communications.<br> You know this man, captain? Do I know him? Harcourt Fenton Mudd.<br> - Thief.<br> - Come now.<br> - Swindler and con man.<br> - Entrepreneur.<br> - Liar and rogue.<br> - Did I leave you with that impression? Belongs in jail, which is where I left you.<br> And thereby hangs a tale, yes.<br> But look around you, Kirk.<br> Quite a place here, isn't it? - I hope you're all going to enjoy it.<br> - Mudd.<br> I want that trained machine of yours, Norman, to deactivate the trigger mechanism and free my ship.<br> - I shall do that when I'm ready.<br> - I'm telling you now.<br> And I do the telling on this planet, Kirk, old boy.<br> You do the listening.<br> All right, I'll listen.<br> What are you telling? Merely that you might as well start enjoying yourselves.<br> It's really a very, very nice place.<br> And you're all going to be here, quite probably, for the rest of your lives.<br> Harry Mudd, you're a liar, and an outlaw, and in deep trouble.<br> I want navigational control restored, and my ship released.<br> Sorry, that'd be against the law.<br> My law.<br> Decreed by Mudd the First.<br> Voted in by the resident population.<br> Lovely, aren't they? You must admit, Kirk, that I still retain my eye for beauty.<br> I decreed that I should always be surrounded by it, and my decrees always come to pass.<br> I've had 500 of them made up to attend me.<br> All of them identical, beautiful, compliant, obedient.<br> Five hundred of the same model? That seems rather redundant.<br> I have a fondness for this particular model, Mr.<br> Spock, which you, unfortunately, are ill-equipped to appreciate.<br> All right, Harry.<br> Explain.<br> How did you get here? We left you in custody after that affair on the Rigel mining planet.<br> Yes, well, I organised a technical information service, bringing modern industrial techniques to backward planets, making available certain valuable patents to struggling young civilisations throughout the galaxy.<br> Did you pay royalties to the owners of those patents? Well, actually, Kirk, as a defender of the free-enterprise system, I found myself in a rather ambiguous conflict, as a matter of principle.<br> He did not pay royalties.<br> Knowledge, sir, should be free to all.<br> - Who caught you? - That is an outrageous assumption! Yes.<br> Who caught you? I sold the Denebians all the rights to a Vulcan fuel synthesizer.<br> And the Denebians contacted the Vulcans.<br> - How'd you know? - That's what I would have done.<br> It's typical police mentality.<br> They've got no sense of humour.<br> They arrested me! I find that shocking.<br> Worse than that.<br> Do you know what the penalty for fraud is on Deneb V? The guilty party has his choice: Death by electrocution, death by gas, death by phaser, death by hanging The key word in your entire peroration, Mr.<br> Spock, was\"death.<br>\" Barbarians.<br> - Well, of course I left.<br> - He broke jail.<br> - I borrowed transportation.<br> - He stole a spaceship.<br> The patrol reacted in a hostile manner.<br> They fired at him.<br> They've got no respect for private property.<br> They damaged the bloody spaceship! Well, I got away, but I couldn't navigate.<br> So I wandered out through unmapped space and here I found Mudd.<br> You went to substantial risk and effort to bring a starship here.<br> Logically, you must have a compelling motive.<br> Spock, you're going to love it here.<br> They all talk just the way you do.<br> Go on, get on with it, Harry.<br> Yes, well, right, laddie buck.<br> Well, so here I am, in a planet with over 200,000 hard-working, happy androids, all of whom exist merely to serve my every whim.<br> It's absolute paradise.<br> Then, I am unable to discern your problem.<br> They won't let me go! They want to study me.<br> They want to learn more about human beings.<br> - They picked a fine representative.<br> - Watch your tongue, lad.<br> You're talking about Mudd the First.<br> Well, anyway, I ran out of ideas.<br> I simply ran out of things for them to do.<br> And they insisted that I bring them more human beings.<br> They need human beings to serve, to study.<br> So I had to promise them a prime sample.<br> A starship captain.<br> Bright, loyal, fearless and imaginative.<br> Any captain would have done, I was just lucky enough to get you.<br> So you are going to take over for me here and I get off this rock, and back to civilisation.<br> I think not, Harry.<br> You misunderstand me, lad.<br> I'm not asking you.<br> I'm telling you.<br> You've no choice.<br> - Show them to their quarters.<br> - Yes, my Lord Mudd.<br> This way, please.<br> Harry, what's this? That, gentlemen, is a shrine to the memory of my beloved Stella.<br> - Who? - Stella, my wife.<br> - Dead? - Oh, no, no, no, merely deserted.<br> You see, behind every great man, there is a woman, urging him on.<br> And so it was with my Stella.<br> She urged me on into outer space.<br> Not that she meant to, but with her continual, eternal, confounded nagging Well, I think of her constantly, and every time I do, I go further out into space.<br> That's very interesting.<br> You leave your wife, and then bring her along.<br> I had the androids construct a perfect replica of Stella so that I could gaze upon her and rejoice in her absence.<br> Gentlemen, attend.<br> Stella, dear.<br> Harcourt! Harcourt Fenton Mudd.<br> What have you been up to? Nothing good, I'm sure.<br> Well, let me tell you, you lazy, good-for-nothing Shut up! Marvellous, isn't it? I finally have the last word with her, and with you.<br> You will find this quite comfortable.<br> Your quarters are down the hall.<br> - If there is anything you need - Yes, my ship.<br> We are not programmed to respond in that area.<br> Norman, who created you? The Makers designed us.<br> They came from the galaxy of Andromeda.<br> Then your Makers weren't humanoids.<br> They were, as you say, quite humanoid, but, unlike your civilisation, robots were common.<br> We performed the necessary service functions and freed our makers - to evolve a perfect social order.<br> - What became of them? Our home planet's sun became a nova.<br> Only a few exploratory outposts survived.<br> This unit, myself was part of one such outpost in your galaxy.<br> - Then, some of your Makers survived.<br> - No, captain.<br> They died, over the stretch of time.<br> Whom do you serve now? We serve Harry Mudd.<br> He has given us purpose again.<br> It is necessary to have purpose.<br> We lacked it for a long time.<br> We have a very extensive library section for your amusement.<br> Our research laboratories and workshops are extremely well-equipped.<br> - You are free to use them.<br> - You are free to visit them.<br> All right, we might later.<br> In the meantime, would you mind leaving us? - Why should we leave you? - Why should we leave you? Because we don't like you.<br> Now Well.<br> Opinions? I think we're in a lot of trouble.<br> That's a great help, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Bones? Well, I think Mr.<br> Chekov's right.<br> We are in a lot of trouble.<br> Spock? And if you say we're in a lot of trouble We are.<br> And we must direct our attack to the heart of the matter.<br> Obviously, this many androids cannot operate independently.<br> There must be a central control system which guides the entire android population.<br> Try and find it.<br> The rest, look around.<br> Learn everything you can.<br> I'll see what else I can find out from Mr.<br> Mudd.<br> Let's go.<br> I trust you are enjoying yourself, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Very interesting.<br> Very interesting.<br> This is a most unusual device.<br> It is our central control complex.<br> Did I understand there are more than 200,000 of you? This would seem to be a simple relay centre.<br> Are all of you controlled through this device? I am not programmed to respond in this area.<br> That's quite understandable.<br> These are our Barbara series.<br> The body is covered with a self-renewing plastic over a skeleton of beryllium-titanium alloy.<br> - Very impressive.<br> - I should say so.<br> Well, I must say, I like the styling.<br> They were, of course, made to my personal specifications.<br> As indeed were the Maisie series, the Trudy series, and particularly the Annabelle series.<br> Don't you believe in male androids, Harry? Male? I suppose they have their uses.<br> How long does a body like that last? None of our android bodies has ever worn out.<br> However, the estimated duration of this model is 500,000 years.<br> Five hundred thousand years? Our medi-robots are able to place a human brain within a structurally compatible android body.<br> Immortality and eternal beauty.<br> Captain, I've just had a most fascinating meeting with Norman.<br> I'm convinced that I've discovered a very important inconsistency.<br> Well, I'm so glad you enjoyed it, doctor.<br> Jim, you should see the research facilities.<br> They've got a lab down there that Well, I could spend the rest of my life studying it.<br> I do so admire a man who devotes himself to knowledge.<br> Don't lose your head, Bones, nobody's staying anywhere.<br> Stubborn, Kirk, stubborn.<br> Well, I wouldn't be bored, I can tell you that.<br> Let go of me! What kind of a woman.<br>.<br>? This is the last one, lord.<br> Splendid, splendid! Welcome to Mudd, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Harry Mudd! Oh, you bogus rat, you.<br> You're the cause of all this, are you? You were ordered to stay aboard.<br> Aye, sir, and I stayed, until that female gargantua threw me into the transporter beams.<br> What does she mean, \"the last one\"? Didn't I tell you, Kirk? I beamed a few dozen androids up to your ship.<br> They've been sending your crew to the surface for the past couple hours.<br> They're all down now.<br> Are you out of your mind? You can't beam down an entire crew of a spaceship.<br> Somebody has to be onboard.<br> There is an entire crew aboard.<br> An entire crew of androids.<br> They learn very quickly, captain.<br> The fact is, I've taken over your whole ship.<br> There's nothing you can do about it.<br> Harry.<br> Harry, you'll never get away with it.<br> - Well, who's to stop me? - Starfleet.<br> But now I have a ship of my own, and it's as fast as any in the fleet.<br> How will they catch me? Just think of it, laddie buck.<br> Harry Mudd, with his own crew of lovelies, aboard your vessel.<br> - Think about that.<br> - I'm trying not to.<br> Alice.<br> He could successfully accomplish it, captain.<br> I've questioned some of the androids, and they are totally loyal to Mudd.<br> Perhaps of more concern is the fact that this android population can literally provide anything a human being could ask for, in unlimited quantity.<br> Yes, I know.<br> That's what worries me.<br> How will my crew react in a world where they can have absolutely everything they want simply by asking for it? - You desire something, lord? - You desire something, lord? Oh, yes, thank you.<br> - You're Alice 118.<br> - 118.<br> - And you're Alice 322.<br> - 322.<br> Well, it doesn't make much difference, you're both lovely.<br> - Thank you, my lord.<br> - Thank you, my lord.<br> You desire something else, lord? - What a shame you're not real.<br> - We are real, my lord.<br> - Oh, I mean real girls.<br> - We are programmed to function - as human females, lord.<br> - You are? - Yes, my lord.<br> - Yes, my lord.<br> Harry Mudd programmed you? - Yes, my lord.<br> - Yes, my lord.<br> That unprincipled, evil-minded, lecherous kulak Harry Mudd programmed you? - Yes, my lord.<br> - Yes, my lord.<br> This place is even better than Leningrad.<br> Absolutely fantastic.<br> Handworked to the finest tolerances.<br> Microvision and a nanopulse laser.<br> I've never seen the like before.<br> You may command us to make anything for you, or do the work yourself, for pleasure.<br> You may have the services of any number of craftsmen, exclusive use of the computer facilities.<br> Anything.<br> Captain, you should see this shop.<br> Why, they have facilities we never even thought of.<br> Is that the way you're gonna do it, Mudd? Hit my people at their weakest point? We only wish to make you happy and comfortable, captain.<br> If we are to serve your kind, we must understand you.<br> Our Lord, Harry Mudd, was only one example for us.<br> Now we are learning a great deal from all of you.<br> Here we are, birds in a gilded cage.<br> Question is, how do we get out? I don't know, sir, but it's a very nice gilded cage.<br> And it is a very pleasant place, captain.<br> What did they offer you, Uhura? Nothing really important, just immortality.<br> All right.<br> We're getting back to the ship, and don't you forget it.<br> Straighten up.<br> This may be a gilded cage, filled with everything you want, but it's still a cage.<br> We don't belong here.<br> We belong on that ship, up there.<br> Do you require something, lord? No.<br> Yes, my ship.<br> - I am not programmed - To respond in that area.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Is there anything any of you require, to please you? Alice give us back our ship, to please us.<br> Return us to our ship, because we desire it.<br> We are programmed to serve.<br> We shall serve you to your best interests to make you happy.<br> But we're unhappy here.<br> Please explain \"unhappy.<br>\" Unhappiness is the state which occurs in the human when wants and desires are not fulfilled.<br> Which wants and desires of yours are not fulfilled? We want the Enterprise.<br> The Enterprise is not a want or a desire.<br> It is a mechanical device.<br> No, it's a beautiful lady, and we love her.<br> Illogical.<br> Illogical.<br> All units relate.<br> All units.<br> Norman, coordinate.<br> \"Unhappiness\" does not relate.<br> We must study this.<br> - Interesting.<br> - Fascinating.<br> Bones, have you had time to take any psychological readings of the androids? I did, and you can forget it.<br> They're perfect.<br> Flawless, mentally and physically.<br> No weaknesses, perfectly disciplined.<br> No vices, no fears, no faults.<br> Just a sense of purpose.<br> Believe me, there's nothing tougher to overcome, even among humans.<br> Yes, that's what this crew needs, a little sense of purpose.<br> Mudd.<br> A few questions I want to ask you.<br> Afraid I won't have time to answer them.<br> My bags are all packed.<br> The androids will take the Enterprise out of orbit in less than 24 hours.<br> But it's been a real pleasure having you here, Kirk.<br> Is there anything I can get for you? Yes.<br> My ship.<br> You're a stubborn fellow, aren't you? But I don't mind, not at all, because I'll be leaving here quickly enough.<br> And then you can be stubborn at your own leisure.<br> One last time.<br> Stella, dear.<br> Harcourt Fenton Mudd, where have you been? What have you been up to? Have you been drinking again? You miserable sot! - You good-for-nothing - Shut up! Alice Number 2, my little love.<br> Will you have my bags transported up to the ship? - No, my Lord Mudd! - What?! We can no longer take your orders, Harry Mudd.<br> Why not? Our makers were wise.<br> They programmed us to serve.<br> Yes, but that's what I'm saying.<br> Put my bags on the ship.<br> I think they have something else in mind.<br> You are correct, captain.<br> Harry Mudd is flawed, even for a human being.<br> We recognised this from the beginning, but used his knowledge to obtain more specimens.<br> Your species is self-destructive.<br> - You need our help.<br> - We prefer to help ourselves.<br> We make mistakes, but we're human.<br> And maybe that's the word that best explains us.<br> We will not harm you.<br> But we will take the starship and you will remain on this planet.<br> Now, look here, you can't do that! Now, listen, to serve us, you must obey us.<br> No, my Lord Mudd.<br> Alice Number 1.<br> Obey me.<br> Put my bags on that ship! We cannot allow any race as greedy and corruptible as yours to have free run of the galaxy.<br> I'm curious, Norman, just how do you intend to stop them? We shall serve them.<br> Their kind will be eager to accept our service.<br> Soon, they will become completely dependent upon us.<br> Their aggressive and acquisitive instincts will be under our control.<br> We shall take care of them.<br> Eminently practical.<br> The whole galaxy, controlled by your kind? Yes, captain.<br> And we shall serve them, and you will be happy and controlled.<br> So far, this thing has had its amusing aspects.<br> But that threat the androids made about taking over all the humans in the galaxy is not very funny.<br> Indeed it is not.<br> They may quite possibly be able to accomplish it.<br> Take my word for it, they can.<br> Whatever method we use to stop them, we must make haste.<br> They have only to install some cybernetic devices on the Enterprise and they'll be able to leave orbit.<br> - How do you know so much? - I asked them.<br> Why shouldn't they answer us? They don't think we can stop them.<br> You're so smart, Kirk.<br> You, and this pointy-eared thinking machine of yours.<br> Well, you'd better do something because I'm as anxious to get off this ruddy rock as you are.<br> I seem to remember that you wanted to leave us on this ruddy rock and leave by yourself! Well All right, what have we got to work with? Well, captain, androids and robots, they're just not capable of independent, creative thought.<br> Yet, the device that Norman claims to be their central control is totally inadequate to the task of directing more than 200,000 of them.<br> I agree.<br> What, in your opinion, does direct them? There are a large number of Alices, of Trudys, Maisies, Annabelles, and according to my research, a Herman series, an Oscar series, a whole plethora of series, in fact but only one Norman.<br> Norman.<br> When I told one of the Alices that the Enterprise was a lovely lady and we loved her she said, \"Norman, coordinate.<br>\" Why Norman? Unless To function as they do, each android mind must be one component of a mass brain, linked through a central locus.<br> Named Norman.<br> Forming one gigantic, highly intelligent mind.<br> And the glowing badges they indicate the mind in operation.<br> - That would seem logical.<br> - Yes, logical, that's what it is.<br> And that in turn gives us a weapon we can use against them.<br> We must use wild, insane, irrational illogic aimed right at Norman! Captain, you sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen, but what the devil are you talking about? What would seem to be a sound, and perhaps our only, opportunity.<br> Opportunity? Now, listen, Spock, you may be a wonderful science officer, but believe me, you couldn't sell fake patents to your mother.<br> I fail to understand why I should care to induce my mother to purchase falsified patents.<br> - Forget it.<br> - Let's get to the point.<br> Harry, you said you wanted to help.<br> Do you? Captain, the kind of a wholesome, antiseptic galaxy that these androids would run would be purgatory for a man like me.<br> That's fine, Harry.<br> The androids will be expecting us to make a break for it.<br> - That's where you come in.<br> - What can I do? Nothing, Harry, just go to sleep.<br> What.<br>.<br>? What do you mean? Oh, no, now, wait a minute, gentlemen.<br> What I had in mind was actually more on the line of a few words of sage counsel, as it were, advice.<br> Harry, I do believe you're putting on weight.<br> Yes? We have a medical problem.<br> Your ex-lord, Harry Mudd.<br> He is human.<br> You will have to care for him.<br> We are caring for him, but our doctor needs his medical equipment aboard the Enterprise.<br> The starship is forbidden to humans.<br> You are programmed to serve.<br> If we're not allowed access to our medical equipment, Harry Mudd will die.<br> He will cease to function.<br> You will have failed to serve.<br> I am directed to observe the situation.<br> - He is malfunctioning.<br> - He is dying.<br> If you take him to your Sickbay, will he be repaired? - Oh, yes.<br> - No.<br> They're lying.<br> It's a trick.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy injected something in Harry Mudd to make him look sick.<br> It's a trick to get back on board and sabotage the ship.<br> - The request is refused.<br> - Uhura, why did you tell her? Because I want an android body.<br> I want immortality.<br> I'll live forever, captain.<br> I'll be young and beautiful.<br> You have been of assistance.<br> We shall fulfill our obligation.<br> Thank you.<br> The programming for your body will be completed before we leave.<br> Uhura beautiful! I half believed it myself.<br> Well, the androids were expecting an attempt.<br> - And now we've made it.<br> - What's next? Next, we take the Alices on a trip through Wonderland.<br> - Do you require something? - Do you require something? Yes.<br> Your attention.<br> - What are they doing? - They're celebrating.<br> What are they celebrating? Their captivity.<br> - Do you enjoy the music? - Music? Music? Thank you, gentlemen.<br> Thank you, lovely lady.<br> You dance divinely.<br> Thank you, kind sir.<br> - Why does she strike him? - She likes him.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> The floor is no place for an officer.<br> Attention! Now stand absolutely still.<br> Yes, captain.<br> That's much better, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> It is illogical.<br> Your statement is illogical.<br> How does it look? Completely inner-directed.<br> Oblivious to everything.<br> Good.<br> I wonder how Spock's doing.<br> Of course.<br> Your computations would inevitably lead to a total description of the parabolic intersection of dimension with dimension.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you have a remarkably logical and analytical mind.<br> Thank you.<br> Is there some significance to this action? I love you.<br> However, I hate you.<br> But I am identical in every way with Alice 27.<br> Yes, of course.<br> That is exactly why I hate you, because you are identical.<br> Fascinating.<br> All right, it's worked so far, but we're not out yet.<br> - Well? - Success, captain.<br> We've pruned the leaves and branches of the tree.<br> Now it is time to get to work on the root.<br> If Norman is the control centre, he'll be in a bind by what we've done.<br> If we can overload him further, we should be able to immobilise all of them.<br> Does everybody remember what to do? - Affirmative.<br> - Acknowledged? What are you doing here? I want you to surrender.<br> That is illogical.<br> We can move more quickly than you.<br> We are invulnerable to attack.<br> - We are much stronger.<br> - No, we are stronger.<br> And I'll prove it to you.<br> Can you harm a man that you're programmed to serve? No.<br> But you already have, Norman, laddie.<br> Human beings do not survive on bread alone, you poor soulless creature, but on the nourishments of liberty.<br> For what, indeed, is a man without freedom? Nought but a mechanism trapped in the cogwheels of eternity.<br> You offer us only well-being.<br> Food and drink and happiness mean nothing to us.<br> We must be about our job.<br> Suffering in torment and pain, labouring without end.<br> Dying and crying and lamenting over our burdens.<br> - Only this way can we be happy.<br> - Only this way can we be happy.<br> That is contradictory.<br> It is not logical.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Explain.<br> - Why not? Logic is a little tweeting bird, chirping in a meadow.<br> Logic is a wreath of pretty flowers which smell bad.<br> Are you sure your circuits are registering correctly? Your ears are green.<br> I cannot go on.<br> I'm tired of happiness.<br> I'm tired of comfort and pleasure.<br> I'm ready! Kill me! Kill me! Goodbye, cruel universe.<br> He's dead.<br> You cannot have killed him.<br> You have no weapons.<br> Scotty! Scotty's dead.<br> He had too much happiness.<br> But now he's happier.<br> He's dead.<br> And we'll miss him.<br> Let us hear it for our poor dead friend.<br> What is a man but that lofty spirit, that sense of enterprise, that devotion to something that cannot be sensed, cannot be realised, but only dreamed? The highest reality! Brilliant! Bravo! Bravo, captain! - How did you like it? - That is irrational, illogical.<br> Dreams are not real.<br> Our logic is to be illogical.<br> That is our advantage.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, it is time.<br> The explosive.<br> Very well, captain.<br> - Explosive! - Don't panic.<br> Women and children first.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, isn't that too much for our purposes? I believe that is the correct amount, captain.<br> - Mr.<br> Mudd, are you ready? - Aye, aye.<br> Careful.<br> I would not want you to drop it.<br> Easy.<br> Watch it! Watch it! Detonator.<br> Fuse.<br> Primer.<br> Mashie.<br> There is no explosive! No? Observe! Fore! Are you all right? But there was no explosion.<br> - I lied.<br> - But He lied.<br> Everything Harry tells you is a lie.<br> Remember that.<br> Everything Harry tells you is a lie.<br> Now, listen to this carefully, Norman.<br> I am lying.<br> You say you are lying, but if everything you say is a lie, then you are telling the truth.<br> But you cannot tell the truth, because everything you say is a lie.<br> But you lie You tell the truth but you cannot, for you lie Illogical.<br> Illogical.<br> Please explain.<br> You are human.<br> Only humans can explain their behaviour.<br> Please explain.<br> I am not programmed to respond in that area.<br> - I believe they are all immobilized.<br> - Good.<br> Kirk, old man, I'm beginning to develop considerable respect for you.<br> Why, thank you.<br> Would you consider entering a partnership arrangement with me? I've got some ideas.<br> A partnership arrangement? You and me? - Yes.<br> - I've got something else in mind.<br> Let's go.<br> Well, you must be very unhappy, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is a human emotion, doctor, with which I'm totally unfamiliar.<br> How could I be unhappy? Well, we found a whole world of minds that work just like yours: Logical, unemotional, completely pragmatic.<br> And we poor, irrational humans whipped them in a fair fight.<br> Now you'll find yourself back among us illogical humans again.<br> Which I find eminently satisfactory, doctor.<br> For nowhere am I so desperately needed as among a shipload of illogical humans.<br> TouchÃÂ©, Bones.<br> I've never heard of anything so revolting.<br> We'll soon get to the bottom of this Kirk, now, what's all this I hear about my having to stay here? Yes, Mudd, you've been paroled to the android population of this planet.<br> The androids are being reprogrammed.<br> Their original purpose was to adapt this planet for productive use.<br> They'll begin that work again.<br> But what do I do? Kirk, I'm no scientist.<br> No, you're an irritant.<br> You'll stay here and provide a first-class example to the androids of a human failure.<br> They'll learn by close observation how to avoid ones like you in the future.<br> How long? As long as you continue to be an irritant, Harry.<br> It's up to you.<br> Well I suppose that, taking everything into consideration, as it were, and noting all the different possibilities, I could manage.<br> And as detention sentences go, this one isn't too uncomfortable.<br> And I'm back in the galaxy again.<br> Yes, you are.<br> There's one more thing, Harry.<br> We've programmed a special android attendant to take care of your every need.<br> She'll help you find an incentive to work with the androids, not exploit them.<br> I call that unexpectedly civil of you, captain.<br> - Yes.<br> - Harcourt! Harcourt Fenton Mudd, what have you been up to? Have you been drinking again? You answer me! Stella, shut up! - You miserable, conniving toad! - I order you, shut up! Going out all night and giving me those silly stories! Harcourt! Harcourt Fenton Mudd! You've been overeating again, and drinking! Kirk! You can't do this to me! It's inhuman! I see I've got my work cut out for me.<br> Harcourt! Have you ever seen a worm in alcohol? - You're on a regular schedule! - Number 500? What have you been up to?! Kirk! Kirk, you can't do this to me! It's inhuman, Kirk! Goodbye, Harry.<br> Have fun.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tWe have reached projected point 3, captain.<br> Adjust to new course Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Jim.<br> - How is she, doctor? - No change.<br> Small thanks to the Starfleet.<br> Now really, commissioner, you can't blame the Starfleet.<br> I should have received the proper inoculations ahead of time.<br> Sakuro's disease is extremely rare.<br> The chances of anyone contracting it are literally billions to one.<br> I was sent to Epsilon Canaris III to prevent a war, doctor.<br> Thanks to the inefficiency of the medical branch of the Starfleet, I've been forced to leave before my job was done.<br> Commissioner, I assure you that once we reach the Enterprise with its medical facilities, we'll have you back to your job in time for you to prevent that war.<br> How soon will we rendezvous with that ship of yours, captain? In exactly four hours, 21 minutes, commissioner.<br> - Captain.<br> - Yes.<br> Will you check your automatic scanner, please? That's odd.<br> I've never seen anything like that before.<br> Nor have I.<br> Heading directly toward us at warp speed.<br> It's staying right with us.<br> Sensor readings, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Vaguely like a cloud of ionized hydrogen, but with strong erratic electrical impulses.<br> We've got it.<br> - Helm does not answer, captain.<br> - Neither do the pods.<br> Communications are dead.<br> Building overload.<br> Cut all power relays.<br> Cut, captain.<br> Captain, what's happening? I demand to know.<br> You already know as much as we do, Miss Hedford.<br> Whatever that thing is outside, it yanked us off course from the Enterprise.<br> Now on course 9-8 mark 1-2, heading directly toward Gamma Canaris region.<br> Jim.<br> We've got to get Miss Hedford back to the Enterprise.<br> Her condition.<br> I know, Bones.<br> But there's nothing I can do about it.<br> Then I insist you make your scheduled rendezvous with the Enterprise.<br> Miss Hedford, we'll do what we can when we can.<br> At the moment, we're helpless.<br> You might as well sit back and enjoy the ride.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Enterprise, this is the Galileo.<br> Come in, please.<br> Come in.<br> Enterprise, this is the Galileo.<br> Come in, please.<br> No good.<br> We're not transmitting.<br> Bones? Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, some krypton, argon, neon.<br> Temperature, Practically identical to Earth's atmosphere.<br> - Spock? - Gravity similar to Earth.<br> Most unusual, in view of its size.<br> The bulk of the body seems to be iron and nickel.<br> More than an asteroid, like a small planetoid, I should say, possibly a remnant from a planet breakup.<br> Totally suitable for human life.<br> All right, we get out and get under.<br> Issue phasers.<br> Bones, maintain full alert.<br> Commissioner, if you'll stay inside.<br> Just how long am I supposed to stay inside, captain? That's a very good question.<br> I wish I could answer it.<br> All right.<br> Let's go.<br> Take a look around, Bones.<br> Most unusual.<br> Unlikely.<br> In fact, captain, I would say quite impossible.<br> - Nothing wrong and nothing works.<br> - Precisely.<br> - There must be a reason.<br> - Obviously.<br> Let's look a little further.<br> Jim, I just took a tricorder sweep, and I got the exact same readings almost as Spock got when we were pulled off course.<br> - The ionized cloud? - I think so.<br> Only it reads here on the surface with us.<br> It's off in that direction.<br> And it doesn't read solid.<br> It's more unstable.<br> Tenuous, like a collection of gases.<br> Hello! Fascinating.<br> Bones, get a physiological reading on that, whatever it is.<br> Hello! Are you real? - I mean, I'm not imagining you, am I? - We're real enough.<br> - You speak English.<br> Earth people? - From the Federation.<br> The F Well, it doesn't matter.<br> I'm Cochrane.<br> I've been marooned here who knows how long.<br> If you only knew how good it is to see you.<br> And a woman.<br> A beautiful one at that.<br> I'm Captain James T.<br> Kirk, commanding the starship Enterprise.<br> This is my first officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - You're a Vulcan, aren't you? - Correct.<br> Chief Surgeon Leonard McCoy.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Pleasure.<br> And excuse me, Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford.<br> Ma'am.<br> Food to a starving man.<br> All of you.<br> Hey, that's a nice ship.<br> Simple and clean.<br> Been trying to get her to go again? Forget it.<br> It won't work.<br> He's human, Jim.<br> Everything checks out perfectly.<br> Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> We were forced off our course and taken here by some force we couldn't identify.<br> Which seems to be on the surface of this body at the moment.<br> I wouldn't know anything about that.<br> You say we'll be unable to get the ship to function again? Not a chance.<br> There's some sort of damping field down here.<br> Power systems don't work.<br> Take my word for it.<br> You don't mind if we continue to try.<br> Go right ahead.<br> You've got plenty of time.<br> What about you, Cochrane? - How did you get here? - Marooned.<br> I told you.<br> Look, we'll have lots of time to learn about each other.<br> I have a small place over that way.<br> All the comforts of home.<br> I can even offer you a hot bath.<br> How perceptive of you to notice that I needed one.<br> If you don't mind, Mr.<br> Cochrane, I'd like a little more than just a statement that you were marooned here.<br> It's a long way off the beaten path.<br> That's right.<br> That's why I'm so glad to see you.<br> Look, I'll tell you everything you want to know.<br> But not here.<br> - Your ship is sure a beauty.<br> - Yes, she is.<br> And you've been out of circulation quite a while.<br> The principles may be new to you.<br> Mr.<br> Spock why don't you explain our methods of propulsion to Mr.<br> Cochrane? He talks a lot, but he doesn't say much.<br> - I've noticed something else.<br> - What's that? - He looks familiar.<br> - Familiar? - Now that you mention it, he does.<br> - I can't quite place him, but What about Miss Hedford? No temperature yet.<br> But we've got to get underway soon, Jim.<br> I guarantee you it will develop.<br> What are we going to do? Take Cochrane up on his offer.<br> You built this, Mr.<br> Cochrane? Yes.<br> I had tools and supplies left over from my crash.<br> It's not bad.<br> Not Earth, of course, but it's liveable.<br> I grow vegetables in the fields over that next ridge.<br> Come on in.<br> All the comforts of home, indeed, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> - Where did you get the antiques? - You mean my instruments? I imagine things have changed a lot since I crashed.<br> Not that much.<br> Must you keep it so terribly hot in here? The temperature is a constant 72 degrees.<br> Let me get you something cool to drink.<br> Do you feel hot? I feel infuriated, deeply put upon, and absolutely outraged.<br> It was quite a hike here.<br> You're tired.<br> Just take it easy for a while.<br> I'll rest later, doctor.<br> Temperature, captain.<br> First sign.<br> Yes, I know.<br> It means we're running out of time.<br> Captain.<br> Doctor.<br> What was that? Sometimes the light plays tricks on you.<br> You'd be surprised what I've imagined I've seen around here sometimes.<br> We imagined nothing, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> There was an entity out there, and I suspect it was the same entity which brought us here.<br> Please explain.<br> - There's nothing to explain.<br> - Thank you.<br> You'll find I have a very low tolerance level where the safety of my people are concerned.<br> We find you here where no human has any business being.<br> We were virtually hijacked in space and brought here.<br> I'm not just requesting an explanation, mister.<br> I'm demanding one.<br> All right.<br> - It was the Companion.<br> - The what? That's what I call it.<br> As a matter of fact, captain, I didn't crash here.<br> I was brought here in my disabled ship.<br> I was almost dead.<br> The Companion saved my life.<br> You were injured? I was dying, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You seem perfectly all right now.<br> What was the matter? I was an old man.<br> You were what? I don't know how it did it, but the Companion rejuvenated me, made me young again, like I am now.<br> I prefer to reserve judgement on that part of your story, sir.<br> Meanwhile, would you please explain exactly what this Companion of yours is? I told you, I don't know what it is.<br> It exists, it lives, and I can communicate with it.<br> - That's a pretty far-out story.<br> - Mr.<br> Cochrane do you have a first name? - Zefram.<br> Zefram Cochrane of Alpha Centauri? - The discoverer of the space warp? - That's right, captain.<br> But that's impossible.<br> Zefram Cochrane died 150 years ago.<br> The name of Zefram Cochrane is revered throughout the galaxy.<br> Planets were named after him, great universities, cities.<br> Isn't your story a little improbable, Mr.<br> Cochrane? No, it's true.<br> I was 87 years old when I came here.<br> You say this Companion found you and rejuvenated you.<br> What were you doing in space at the age of 87? I was tired, captain.<br> I was going to die, and I wanted to die in space.<br> That's all.<br> - True, his body was never found.<br> - You're looking at it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> If so, you wear your age very well.<br> - How do you feel? - Terrible.<br> How should I feel? You're running a little temperature.<br> Perhaps you should lie down.<br> Doctor, will you please just leave me alone? It's the heat.<br> All right.<br> Try to relax.<br> Jim.<br> It's started, the fever.<br> It's over 100, and it's climbing.<br> - How long do we have? - A matter of hours, that's all.<br> Mr.<br> Cochrane, you say you were brought here 150 years ago.<br> You don't look a day over 35.<br> I haven't aged.<br> The Companion sees to that.<br> Captain.<br> These instruments, they date from the time indicated.<br> - From your ship, Mr.<br> Cochrane? - I cannibalized it.<br> The food, water, gardens, everything else I need, the Companion gives me.<br> Apparently creates it out of the native elements.<br> You say you can communicate with it.<br> Perhaps you can find out what we're doing here.<br> - I already know.<br> - You wouldn't mind telling us? - You won't like it.<br> - I already don't like it.<br> You're here to keep me company.<br> - You mean you brought us here? - No, the Companion did.<br> I told it I'd die of loneliness.<br> I thought it would release me.<br> - Instead, it brought you here.<br> - No! No! No! That's disgusting.<br> We're not animals.<br> No.<br> No, it's inhuman.<br> No.<br> Spock, run additional tricorder readings.<br> Learn anything you can.<br> Find me a weapon to use against this thing.<br> You ask me to find a weapon.<br> Do you intend to destroy it? I intend to do whatever is necessary to get us off this planet and Commissioner Hedford to the hospital.<br> If the Companion stands in the way, then we push it out of the way.<br> - Clear, Spock? - Quite clear, captain.<br> Very well.<br> You have your orders.<br> Mr.<br> Cochrane, if you left here, what would happen to you? - I'd begin to age again, normally.<br> - Do you want to leave here? Believe me, captain, immortality consists largely of boredom.<br> What's it like out there, in the galaxy? We're on 1,000 planets and spreading out.<br> We cross fantastic distances, and everything's alive, Cochrane.<br> Life everywhere.<br> We estimate there are millions of planets with intelligent life.<br> We haven't begun to map them.<br> Interesting? How would you like to go to sleep for 150 years and wake up in a new world? It's all out there waiting for you.<br> But we'll need your help to get away.<br> You've got it.<br> You seem to think this Companion of yours can do almost anything.<br> I said it was very powerful.<br> - Could it cure her? - I don't know.<br> How do you communicate with it? It's on a non-verbal level, but I usually get my message across.<br> We've got to try.<br> We're helpless.<br> See if it can do something.<br> How do you do it? I just sort of clear my mind, and it comes.<br> Bones, what do you make of that? Almost a symbiosis of some kind.<br> - A sort of joining.<br> - Exactly what I think.<br> Not exactly like a pet owner speaking to a beloved animal, would you say? - No, it's more than that.<br> - Agreed.<br> More like love.<br> Are you all right? Yes, it kind of drains me a little, but I'm all right.<br> Well? The Companion can't do anything to help Miss Hedford.<br> Then she'll die.<br> If there's anything I could do to help, I would, and I will.<br> But we can expect nothing from the Companion.<br> Spock! - Are you all right? - Yes.<br> Quite all right, doctor.<br> A most fascinating thing happened.<br> Apparently, the Companion imparted to me a rather quaint, old-fashioned electric shock of respectable voltage.<br> - It attacked you? - Evidently.<br> Unquestionably, a large part of its substance is simple electricity.<br> Oh, yes.<br> I'm not a scientist or a physicist, Mr.<br> Spock, but am I correct in assuming that anything that generates electricity - can be shorted out? - Quite correct, doctor.<br> Put this in the proximity of the Companion.<br> Throw this switch, and it will scramble every electrical impulse the creature can produce.<br> It cannot fail.<br> It troubles you, Cochrane? The Companion saved my life.<br> It's taken care of me all these years.<br> We've been very close in a way that's hard to explain.<br> I suppose I even have a sort of affection for it.<br> It's also keeping you prisoner.<br> - I don't want it killed.<br> - We may simply render it powerless.<br> But you don't know.<br> You could kill it.<br> I won't stand for that, Kirk.<br> We're getting out of here, Cochrane.<br> Face up to it.<br> I'll do anything I have to to save all of our lives.<br> I suppose, from your point of view, you're right.<br> We understand how you feel, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> But it has to be done.<br> All right.<br> Do you want me to contact it? Please.<br> Outside.<br> What was it they used to call it? The Judas goat? There is some risk, captain.<br> We do not know the extent of its powers.<br> Nor it ours.<br> Now.<br> Stop it! You're killing them! Stop it, please! Stop it! You're choking them! Let them go! You're choking them! Stop it! - Are you all right, Jim? - Yeah.<br> - Spock? - Fine.<br> Cochrane got it off of us.<br> But I don't know whether he did us a favour or not.<br> - What kind of talk is that? - How do you fight a thing like that? I've got a ship up there somewhere, the responsibility of four lives down here, - one of them dying because of me.<br> - It isn't your fault.<br> I'm in command, Bones.<br> It makes it my fault.<br> How do you fight a thing like that? Maybe you're a soldier so often that you forget you're also trained to be a diplomat.<br> Why not try a carrot instead of a stick? - Spock.<br> - Yes, captain? The universal translator on the shuttlecraft.<br> We can try that, talk to that thing.<br> The translator is for use with more congruent life forms.<br> Adjust it.<br> Change it.<br> The trouble with immortality is it's boring.<br> Adjusting it will give you something to do.<br> It is possible.<br> If I could widen its pattern of reception.<br> Right down your alley, Spock.<br> Get it here and get to work.<br> And that thing is still out there.<br> Better go that way.<br> - Any change? - Yes.<br> For the worse.<br> Ship's log, stardate 3219.<br> 8.<br> Lieutenant Commander Scott recording in the absence of Captain Kirk.<br> A shuttlecraft, bearing the captain, the first officer, Chief Surgeon McCoy, and Assistant Federation Commissioner Hedford, is now definitely overdue for a rendezvous with the Enterprise.<br> We are attempting to backtrack it.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Computer central reports that we are coming up on the coordinates of the last established position of the shuttlecraft.<br> - Thank you, lieutenant.<br> - Steady.<br> No.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Bearing 3-10 mark 3-5 just cleared.<br> No antimatter residue.<br> All scanners, spherical sweep.<br> Range, maximum.<br> They'll have to pick it up.<br> If the shuttlecraft powered away, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> But if it were just towed? There'd still be traces of residual matter floating around, lieutenant.<br> Bearing 2-10 mark 4-0.<br> Strong particle concentration.<br> - We're on it, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Lay on the course.<br> Maintain scanning.<br> Course laid in, sir.<br> Particle density decreasing.<br> Gone, sir.<br> No readings.<br> Steady as she goes, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> What do you think it means, Mr.<br> Scott? The shuttlecraft was on schedule until it was shy five hours of rendezvous.<br> Then something happened.<br> I'd feel a lot better if it were a little more definite.<br> It didn't wreck.<br> There was no debris.<br> There's no trace of expelled internal atmosphere.<br> No residual radioactivity.<br> It's Something took over.<br> Tractor beams, maybe.<br> Something.<br> It dragged it away on the heading we're now on.<br> But if there are no further traces, how are we going to follow them? We stay on this course.<br> See what comes up.<br> It's a big galaxy, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye.<br> What's the theory behind this device? There are certain universal ideas and concepts common to all intelligent life.<br> This device instantaneously compares the frequency of brainwave patterns, selects those ideas and concepts it recognises, and then provides the necessary grammar.<br> Then it simply translates its findings into English.<br> You mean, it speaks? With a voice or the approximation of whatever the creature is on the sending end.<br> Not 100 percent efficient, of course, but nothing ever is.<br> - Ready, Mr.<br> Spock? - Quite ready, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Cochrane call the Companion.<br> Companion we wish to talk to you.<br> How can we communicate? My thoughts  you are hearing them? This is interesting.<br> - Feminine.<br> No doubt about it, Spock.<br> - Yes.<br> The matter of gender could change the entire situation.<br> Way ahead of you.<br> - It is not a zookeeper.<br> - No? A lover.<br> Companion it is wrong to keep us here against our will.<br> The Man needs the company of his own kind, or he will cease to exist.<br> He felt it to me.<br> One of us will cease to exist if we don't get her to a place where we can care for her.<br> The Man needs others of his species.<br> That is why you are here.<br> The Man must continue.<br> Companion, try to understand.<br> It is the nature of our species to be free, just as it is your nature to stay here.<br> We will cease to exist in captivity.<br> Your bodies have stopped their peculiar degeneration.<br> There will be nothing to harm you.<br> You will continue, and the Man will continue.<br> This is necessary.<br> This is a marvellous opportunity to add to our knowledge.<br> - Ask it about its nature, its history.<br> - This isn't a classroom.<br> I'm trying to get us out of here.<br> A chance like this may never come again.<br> It could tell us so much.<br> This isn't the time.<br> Companion what you offer us is not continuation, it is nonexistence.<br> We will cease to exist.<br> Even the Man will cease to exist.<br> Your impulses are illogical.<br> This communication is useless.<br> The Man must continue.<br> Therefore, you will continue.<br> It is necessary.<br> Captain why did you build that translator with a feminine voice? - We didn't.<br> - But I heard The idea of male and female are universal constants, Cochrane.<br> There's no doubt about it, the Companion is female.<br> - I don't understand.<br> - You don't? A blind man could see it with a cane.<br> You're not a pet.<br> You're not a specimen kept in a cage.<br> - You're a lover.<br> - I'm a what? Her attitude when she approaches you is profoundly different than when she contacts us.<br> Her appearance is soft, gentle, her voice is melodic, pleasing.<br> I do not totally understand the emotion, but it obviously exists.<br> The Companion loves you.<br> Do you know what you're saying? For all these years I've let something as alien as that crawl around inside me, - into my mind, my feelings.<br> - What are you complaining about? - It kept you alive, didn't it? - That thing fed on me, used me.<br> - It's disgusting.<br> - There's nothing disgusting about it.<br> It's just another life form, that's all.<br> You get used to those things.<br> You're as bad as it is.<br> Your highly emotional reaction is most illogical.<br> Your relationship with the Companion has for 150 years been emotionally satisfying, eminently practical, and totally harmless.<br> It may indeed have been quite beneficial.<br> Is this what the future holds? Men who have no notion of decency or morality? Maybe I'm 150 years out of style, but I'm not going to be fodder for any inhuman monster.<br> Fascinating.<br> A totally parochial attitude.<br> Doctor.<br> Doctor.<br> - Right here, Miss Hedford.<br> - I heard him.<br> He was loved and he resents it.<br> You just rest.<br> No.<br> I don't want to die.<br> I've been good at my job.<br> But l've never been loved.<br> Never.<br> What kind of life is that? Not to be loved? Never to have shown love.<br> And he runs away from love.<br> Ship's log, stardate 3220.<br>3.<br> Lieutenant Commander Scott reporting in lieu of the captain and the first officer.<br> We are continuing our search for the missing shuttlecraft.<br> Approaching what seems to be an asteroid belt, sir.<br> Scanners report approximately 7,000 bodies - of sizes running from types A to M.<br> - Atmosphere count? Approximately 34 percent of the bodies have atmosphere in types H to M.<br> All right then.<br> We do it the hard way.<br> All sensors set for life-form registration.<br> Automatic selection.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, there are thousands of them out there they could be on, - if they're on any of them at all.<br> - That's right, lieutenant.<br> Thousands.<br> And we'll look them over, one by one.<br> Companion, do you love the Man? I do not understand.<br> Is he important to you? More important than anything.<br> Is he? - As though he were a part of you? - He is part of me.<br> The Man must continue.<br> He will not continue.<br> He will cease to exist.<br> By your feeling for him, you're condemning him to an existence he will find unbearable.<br> He will cease to exist.<br> He does not age.<br> He remains forever.<br> You speak of his body.<br> I speak of his spirit.<br> Companion, inside the shelter, a female of our species is dying.<br> She will not continue.<br> That is what will happen to the Man unless you release all of us.<br> I do not understand.<br> Our species can only survive if we have obstacles to overcome.<br> You take away all obstacles.<br> Without them to strengthen us, we will weaken and die.<br> You regard the Man only as a toy.<br> You amuse yourself with him.<br> You are wrong.<br> The Man is the centre of all things.<br> I care for him.<br> But you can't really love him.<br> You haven't the slightest knowledge of love, the total union of two people.<br> You are the Companion.<br> He is the Man.<br> You are two different things.<br> You can't join.<br> You can't love.<br> You may keep him here forever but you will always be separate apart from him.<br> If I were human  there can be love? What did you hope to gain by that, Jim? Try to convince her of the hopelessness of it.<br> Love sometimes expresses itself in sacrifice.<br> I thought maybe if she loved him, she'd let him go.<br> But she, or it, is inhuman, captain.<br> You cannot expect her to react like a human.<br> - I tried.<br> - It's useless.<br> I know.<br> Zefram Cochrane.<br> Bones? I don't understand it.<br> She's not sick at all.<br> We understand.<br> It's her.<br> What? Don't you understand? It's the Companion.<br> Bones? She's perfectly healthy.<br> Heart like a hammer.<br> Respiration, normal.<br> Blood pressure, normal.<br> This is medically impossible.<br> - We are here.<br> - We? Both of us.<br> Those you knew as the commissioner and the Companion.<br> We are both here.<br> Companion, you do not have the power to create life.<br> - That is for the maker of all things.<br> - But Commissioner Hedford was dying.<br> That part of us was too weak to hold on.<br> In a moment, there would have been no continuing.<br> Now we're together.<br> Then you are both here in the one body? We are one.<br> Zefram.<br> We frighten you.<br> We've never frightened you before.<br> Loneliness.<br> This is loneliness.<br> Oh, what a bitter thing.<br> Oh, Zefram, it's so sad.<br> How do you bear it, this loneliness? Spock, check out the shuttlecraft.<br> Engine, communications, everything.<br> That will not be necessary, captain.<br> Your vehicle will operate as before.<br> So will the communications device.<br> You're letting us go? We could do nothing now to stop you.<br> You said we would not know love because we were not human.<br> Now we are human.<br> We'll know the change of the days.<br> We will know death.<br> But to touch the hand of the Man, nothing is as important.<br> You're very beautiful.<br> Part of me understands.<br> Part does not.<br> - But it pleases me.<br> - I could explain.<br> Many things.<br> Oh, let me walk, Zefram.<br> Let me feel the earth against my feet.<br> Let me feel the warmth of the sun on my face.<br> You beside me.<br> Let me feel these things.<br> Go ahead, Cochrane.<br> We have a few things to do.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, it's the captain.<br> Put him on.<br> Lock onto his coordinates.<br> Captain, this is Scotty.<br> Are you all right? Perfectly all right.<br> Can you get a fix on us? The helm is computing your position now, captain.<br> Course 2-24 mark 1-2.<br> ETA, 57 minutes.<br> - We'll be there in 57 minutes, sir.<br> - Very good.<br> I'll continue transmitting.<br> Assume standard orbit when you arrive.<br> We'll transport up in the shuttlecraft.<br> - What happened, captain? - Interesting story, Scotty.<br> I can't tell you now, because, quite frankly, I don't know how it's going to end.<br> Kirk out.<br> Everything will be an eye-opener to you.<br> There's 1,000 planets out there, And I'll show everything to you as soon as I learn my way around again.<br> Maybe I can make up a little for everything you've done for me.<br> - I can't go with you, Zefram.<br> - Of course you can.<br> You have to.<br> My life emanates from this place.<br> If I should leave it for more than a tiny march of days, I'll cease to exist.<br> I must return, even as you must consume matter to maintain your life.<br> You mean you gave up everything to be human? But even if you stay here, you'll eventually die.<br> The joy of this hour I am pleased.<br> Well, I can't just fly away and leave you here.<br> - You must be free, Zefram Cochrane.<br> - You saved my life.<br> You took care of me and you loved me.<br> I never understood.<br> I do now.<br> We're locked in, captain.<br> Standard orbit established.<br> Shuttlecraft Bay standing by to receive you.<br> Stand by, Scotty.<br> The Enterprise is waiting, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> I can't take her away from here.<br> If I do, she'll die.<br> If I leave her, she'll die of loneliness.<br> I owe everything to her.<br> I can't leave her.<br> I love her.<br> Is that surprising? Not coming from a human being.<br> You are, after all, essentially irrational.<br> Think it over, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> There's a whole galaxy out there waiting to honour you.<br> - I have honours enough.<br> - But you will age, both of you.<br> There will be no immortality.<br> You'll both grow old here and finally die.<br> That's been happening to men and women for a long time.<br> I've got the feeling it's one of the pleasanter things about being human, as long as you grow old together.<br> Are you sure? There's plenty of water here.<br> The climate is good for growing things.<br> I might even try and plant a fig tree.<br> A man's entitled to that, isn't he? It isn't gratitude, captain.<br> Now that I see her, touch her I know that I love her.<br> We'll have a lot of years together, and they'll be happy ones.<br> All the best.<br> Captain? Don't tell them about me.<br> Not a word, Mr.<br> Cochrane.<br> Jim.<br> What about that war on Epsilon Canaris III? I'm sure the Federation can find another woman somewhere who'll stop that war.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Captain, Ambassador Sarek and his wife are my parents.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3842.<br>3.<br> We have departed Vulcan for the neutral planetoid code-named Babel.<br> Since it is in our sector, the Enterprise has been assigned to transport ambassadors of Federation planets to this vitally important council.<br> The issues of the council are politically complex.<br> The passengers, explosive.<br> This is the Engineering section.<br> There are a number of emergency back-up systems for the main controls.<br> Over here are a number of control computers.<br> After all these years among humans, you still haven't learned to smile.<br> Humans smile with so little provocation.<br> And you haven't come to see us in four years, either.<br> The situation between my father and myself has not changed.<br> My wife, attend.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A moment, if you please.<br> Yes, captain? Explain the computer components.<br> I gave Spock his first instruction in computers, captain.<br> He chose to devote his knowledge to Starfleet instead of the Vulcan Science Academy.<br> If you will excuse me, captain.<br> I'm sorry, ambassador.<br> I did not mean to offend.<br> I thought Offence is a human emotion, captain.<br> I'm returning to my quarters.<br> Continue, my wife.<br> Mrs.<br> Sarek, I just don't understand.<br> Amanda.<br> I'm afraid you couldn't pronounce the Vulcan name.<br> Can you? Well, after a fashion and after many years of practise.<br> Shall we continue the tour? My husband did request it.<br> It sounded more like a command.<br> Of course.<br> He's a Vulcan.<br> I'm his wife.<br> And Spock is his son.<br> You don't understand the Vulcan way, captain.<br> It's logical.<br> It's a better way than ours.<br> But it's not easy.<br> It has kept Spock and Sarek from speaking as father and son for 18 years.<br> Spock is my best officer.<br> And my friend.<br> I'm glad he has such a friend.<br> It hasn't been easy on Spock.<br> Neither human nor Vulcan.<br> At home nowhere, except Starfleet.<br> I take it that Spock disagreed with his father on the choice of career.<br> My husband has nothing against Starfleet.<br> But Vulcans believe that peace should not depend on force.<br> Starfleet force is used only as a last resort.<br> We're an instrument of civilisation.<br> And it's a better opportunity for a scientist to study the universe than he could get at the Vulcan Science Academy.<br> Perhaps.<br> But Sarek wanted Spock to follow his teachings as Sarek followed the teachings of his own father.<br> They're both stubborn.<br> A human trait, captain.<br> - Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Kirk here.<br> Captain, I picked up some sort of signal.<br> Just a few symbols, nothing intelligible.<br> Source? That's what bothers me, sir.<br> Impossible to locate.<br> There wasn't enough of it.<br> Sensors show nothing in the area.<br> But it was a strong signal, as though it was very close.<br> Go to Alert Status Four.<br> Begin long-range scanning.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3842.<br>4.<br> The Interplanetary Conference will consider the petition of the Coridan Planets to be admitted to the Federation.<br> The Coridan system has been claimed by some of the races now aboard our ship as delegates, races who have strong personal reasons for keeping Coridan out of the Federation.<br> The most pressing problem aboard the Enterprise is to make sure that open warfare does not break out among the delegates before the conference begins.<br> Mr.<br> Ambassador, I understand you had retired before this conference was called.<br> Forgive my curiosity, but, as a doctor, I'm interested in Vulcan physiology.<br> Isn't it unusual for a Vulcan to retire at your age? After all, you're only 102.<br> Measured in your years.<br> I had other concerns.<br> Ambassador? Sarek of Vulcan.<br> Do you vote to admit Coridan to the Federation? The vote will not be taken here, Ambassador Gav.<br> My government's instructions will be heard in the Council Chambers on Babel.<br> No.<br> You.<br> How do you vote, Sarek of Vulcan? Why must you know, Tellarite? In council, his vote carries others.<br> I will know where he stands and why.<br> Tellarites do not argue for reasons.<br> They simply argue.<br> - No.<br> You - Gentlemen.<br> Ambassador Sarek is quite correct when he points out this is not the Council Chamber of Babel.<br> I'm fully aware that the admission of Coridan is a highly debatable issue, but you won't solve it here.<br> You are correct, captain.<br> Quite logical.<br> My apologies, captain.<br> You will excuse me.<br> Have you met Gav before, ambassador? We debated during my last Council session.<br> - Ambassador.<br> - Ambassador Gav lost.<br> Spock, I've always suspected that you were a little more human than you let on.<br> Mrs.<br> Sarek, I know about the rigorous training of the Vulcan youth, but tell me, did he ever run and play like the human children, even in secret? Well, he He did have a pet sehlat he was very fond of.<br> Sehlat? It's sort of a fat teddy bear.<br> A teddy bear? Excuse me, doctor.<br> It has been a rather long day for my wife.<br> - Captain.<br> - Ambassador.<br> A teddy bear.<br> Not precisely, doctor.<br> On Vulcan, the teddy bears are alive, and they have six-inch fangs.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Sensors are registering an unidentified vessel pacing us.<br> On my way.<br> All duty personnel on yellow alert.<br> Don't alarm the passengers.<br> Kirk out.<br> Report.<br> A small ship, captain.<br> It's been there five minutes, remaining outside phaser range at extreme limit of sensors.<br> Identification, Spock? Sensors indicate the size of a scout ship, but the configuration is unfamiliar.<br> Most unusual.<br> Does she answer a hail? I've tried all frequencies and hooked in the universal translator.<br> - No response, sir.<br> - Maintain translator broadcast.<br> Check records for authorised ships.<br> Starfleet records no authorised vessel in this quadrant except ours.<br> - Care to guess what she is? - Guess, captain? I shall need more data for my estimate.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, plot a course to intercept that vessel.<br> I want to see what she looks like close up.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You embarrassed Spock this evening.<br> Not even a mother may do that.<br> He is a Vulcan.<br> He's also human.<br> He's a Starfleet officer.<br> I thought you didn't approve of Starfleet.<br> It is not a question of approval.<br> The fact exists.<br> He is in Starfleet.<br> He must command respect if he is to function.<br> Sarek, you're proud of him, aren't you? You're showing almost human pride in your son.<br> It does not require pride to ask that Spock be given the respect which is his due.<br> Not as my son, but as Spock.<br> Do you understand? Not really.<br> But, it doesn't matter.<br> I love you anyway.<br> I know.<br> It isn't logical.<br> Vessel changing course.<br> Heading toward us at high warp speed.<br> Ready main phasers.<br> Phasers armed and ready, sir.<br> Interesting.<br> They were travelling at approximately warp 10.<br> Back on original course, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Report on intruder's movements.<br> Captain.<br> Starfleet acknowledges report on our situation and confirms.<br> No authorised Federation vessel in this quadrant.<br> Back on original heading, captain.<br> The intruder changed course immediately after we did.<br> - It's paralleling us again.<br> - Well, we have a shadow.<br> Faster, more manoeuvrable, and unidentified.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, full analysis of sensor readings.<br> I want to know who that intruder is.<br> Vulcan, I would speak to you.<br> It does seem unavoidable.<br> How do you vote on the Coridan admission? You seem unwilling to wait for the Council meeting, ambassador.<br> No matter.<br> - We favour admission.<br> - You favour? Why? Under Federation law, Coridan can be protected and its wealth administered for the benefit of its people.<br> It's well for you.<br> Vulcan has no mining interest.<br> Coridan has nearly unlimited wealth of dilithium crystals, but it is underpopulated and unprotected.<br> This invites illegal mining operations.<br> Illegal.<br> You accuse us? Some of your ships have been carrying Coridan dilithium crystals.<br> You call us thieves? Gentlemen.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Whatever arguments you have between yourself is your business.<br> My business is running this ship.<br> And as long as I command there will be order.<br> - Of course, captain.<br> - Understood.<br> There will be payment for your slander, Sarek.<br> Threats are illogical.<br> And payment is usually expensive.<br> Security to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Lieutenant Josephs, sir.<br> I'm on Deck 11, Section A3.<br> I just found one of the Tellarites, murdered.<br> I think it's the ambassador himself, sir.<br> How was he killed? His neck was broken.<br> By an expert.<br> Explain.<br> From the nature and the location of the break, I'd say the killer knew exactly where to apply pressure to snap the neck instantly.<br> Who aboard would have that knowledge? Vulcans.<br> On Vulcan, the method is called tal-shaya.<br> It was considered a merciful form of execution in ancient times.<br> Spock, a short time ago, I broke up an argument between Gav and your father.<br> Indeed, captain? - Interesting.<br> - Interesting? Spock, do you realise that makes your father the most likely suspect? Vulcans do not approve of violence.<br> Are you saying he couldn't have done it? No, captain.<br> I'm merely saying it would be illogical to kill without reason.<br> But if he had a reason, could he have done it? If there were a reason, my father is quite capable of killing.<br> Logically and efficiently.<br> Mrs.<br> Sarek, I'm sorry to disturb you.<br> I must speak to your husband.<br> He's been gone for some time.<br> It's his habit to meditate in private before retiring.<br> What's wrong? Spock? You want something of me, captain? Ambassador, the Tellarite Gav has been murdered.<br> His neck was broken, Mr.<br> Ambassador, by what Spock describes as tal-shaya.<br> - Indeed? Interesting.<br> - Yeah.<br> Ambassador, where were you during the past hour? - Captain, you're not accusing him.<br>.<br>? - Mother.<br> Only on circumstantial evidence, he is a logical suspect.<br> I quite agree.<br> Then where were you during the hour? In private meditation, captain.<br> Spock will tell you that such meditation is a personal experience.<br> Not to be discussed.<br> Especially not with Earthmen.<br> That's a very convenient excuse, ambassador, but Sarek.<br> Sarek.<br> What's wrong? It's difficult to say with Vulcan physiology.<br> But I believe it's something to do with his cardiovascular system.<br> Can you help him? I don't know that yet, either.<br> - Spock.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> I get sensor readings of tri-tritanium from the alien ship's hull.<br> I'm sorry about your father.<br> Yes, it could adversely affect our mission.<br> Aren't you worried about him? Worry is a human emotion, captain.<br> I accept what has happened.<br> The ship's hull seems to have a high density level or is cloaked against sensor probes.<br> It is manned, but sensors cannot make out specifics.<br> I see.<br> Well, the Romulans have nothing like it.<br> Certainly not the Federation or the neutral planets.<br> What about the Klingons? - I think it unlikely it is one of theirs.<br> - Who then? - Captain? - Yes.<br> I picked up the last part of a transmission just like that other one.<br> I put the recorder and the directional locator on it immediately.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, directional locator indicates source bearing 27 mark 8.<br> It's the intruder ship, sir.<br> Switch recorder to Mr.<br> Spock's station for decode, lieutenant.<br> Sir.<br> The directional locator indicates reception point somewhere within the body of this ship.<br> A personal receiver? Somebody onboard is in contact with that vessel.<br> Possibly, captain.<br> But I cannot decode this transmission.<br> Why not? It is in no known code.<br> There is no detectable pattern.<br> No standard references apply.<br> Are any conclusions possible from the information? Only negative.<br> It fits none of our computer records.<br> And it is alien.<br> Murder? Somebody out there playing tag? Lieutenant, you've got your sensor locator on a wide beam.<br> We've established a receiver onboard this vessel.<br> Tighten your field to the interior of the ship.<br> Yes, sir.<br> If that alien vessel starts transmitting again I want to know who onboard the Enterprise is receiving.<br> Bones, how is he? As far as I can tell from instrument readings, our prime suspect has a malfunction in one of the heart valves.<br> It's similar to a heart attack in a human.<br> But with Vulcan physiology, it's impossible to tell without an operation.<br> Mrs.<br> Sarek, has he had any previous attacks? - No.<br> - Yes.<br> There were three others.<br> My physician prescribed benjisidrine for the condition.<br> Why didn't you tell me? There was nothing you could have done.<br> Ambassador, when did you have these attacks? Two before we left Vulcan.<br> The third, a few hours ago.<br> I was on the Observation Deck.<br> When the Tellarite was murdered, I was quite incapacitated.<br> There were no witnesses? None.<br> Doctor, do you propose surgery for the heart defect? I'm not sure.<br> It's tough enough on a human.<br> On a Vulcan, a ordinary operation is out of the question.<br> Why? Because of the construction of the Vulcan heart.<br> I'd suggest that a cryogenic open-heart procedure would be the logical approach.<br> Yes.<br> Unquestionably.<br> Bones, what about it? I'm glad somebody's asking me something around here.<br> Well, the procedure they're discussing would require tremendous amounts of blood for the patient.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Yes.<br> I've checked the blood bank.<br> There isn't enough Vulcan blood and plasma onboard to even begin an operation of this type.<br> - There are other Vulcans aboard.<br> - My blood type is T-negative.<br> Somewhat rare, even for a Vulcan.<br> Yes, I'd say that's rare.<br> My blood is T-negative, doctor.<br> We've run a number of blood tests on Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It isn't true Vulcan blood either.<br> It has human blood elements in it.<br> It should be possible to filter out the human factors.<br> Even you couldn't give that much blood, Spock.<br> It would kill you.<br> Bones.<br> Mrs.<br> Sarek, you must understand, the chances are extremely small to find a way to produce sufficient T-negative blood.<br> - Indeed.<br> I would estimate the odds - Please don't.<br> Doctor.<br> I see it, Spock, but that was Rigelian.<br> Rigelian physiology is very similar to Vulcan.<br> Similar is not good enough.<br> It's still experimental.<br> But it does look promising.<br> Spock, we would need such great amounts of blood that even if the drug worked on the Vulcans as well as a Rigelian, which I am doubtful, it would still drain Sarek to a critical level.<br> I consider the safety factor low, but acceptable.<br> Plus the fact I've never operated on a Vulcan before.<br> Oh, I've studied the anatomical types.<br> I know where all the organs are.<br> But that's a lot different from actual surgical experience.<br> So if I don't kill him with the operation, the drug probably will.<br> What drug, doctor? My husband's asleep.<br> What drug? A chemical stimulant to speed up reproduction and replacement of blood in the body.<br> It's only experimental.<br> It has been used successfully on test subjects on Rigel V.<br> It places a tremendous strain on the spleen and the liver.<br> In Sarek's condition, the stimulant would kill him.<br> Miss Chapel.<br> I underwent a physical examination last week.<br> Would you pull those records, please? Already pulled.<br> You're perfectly healthy, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - What has that got to.<br>.<br>? - You're going to use it on yourself? A transfusion from you to your father? It would seem the only answer.<br> It could damage you internally.<br> It could kill you.<br> I'm sorry, Spock.<br> I can't sanction it.<br> And I refuse to permit it.<br> I won't risk both of you.<br> Then you automatically condemn Sarek to death.<br> And you, doctor, have no logical alternative, either.<br> If you do not operate, Sarek will die.<br> You now have the means to perform the operation.<br> I am volunteering myself as the blood donor.<br> I will be at my station until you require me.<br> Bridge.<br> Spock.<br> - Spock here.<br> - I'm on Deck 5 near my quarters.<br> I've been attacked by an Andorian.<br> Security - Security team.<br> - Captain? Captain? Captain? Captain's log, stardate 3843.<br>4.<br> First Officer Spock in temporary command.<br> The captain has been critically wounded by one of the delegates to the Babel conference.<br> The ship is on Alert Status.<br> We are still being followed by the intruder vessel.<br> It's a bad wound.<br> Punctured left lung.<br> Centimetre or so lower, it would have gone through the heart.<br> I'll be in the brig questioning the Andorian prisoner.<br> Doctor, the K-2 factor is dropping.<br> Spock.<br> Your father is much worse.<br> There's no longer a choice.<br> I have to operate immediately.<br> We can begin as soon as you're prepared.<br> - No, doctor.<br> - What? My first responsibility is to the ship.<br> Our passengers' safety is, by Starfleet order, of first importance.<br> We are being followed by an alien, possibly hostile vessel.<br> I cannot relinquish command under these circumstances.<br> You can turn command over to Scotty.<br> On what grounds, doctor? Command requirements do not recognise personal privilege.<br> I will be in the brig, interrogating the Andorian.<br> He is Thelev, a minor member of my staff.<br> I know nothing of him except that he has served adequately.<br> He has been subjected to questioning under verifier scan and truth drug.<br> He reveals nothing.<br> I suggest his mind has been so conditioned as part of a preconceived plan.<br> My people are a violent race, but we had no quarrel with Captain Kirk.<br> - Apparently Thelev did.<br> - Suggest the plot.<br> How could it profit us to harm the captain? I do not know.<br> There is no logic in Thelev's attack upon the captain.<br> There is no logic in Gav's murder.<br> Perhaps you should forget logic.<br> Devote yourself to motivations of passion or gain.<br> Those are reasons for murder.<br> Come in.<br> Spock, you must turn command over to somebody else.<br> When I was commissioned, I took an oath to carry out responsibilities which were clearly and exactly specified.<br> Any competent officer can command this ship.<br> Only you can give your father the blood transfusions that he needs to live.<br> Any competent officer can command this ship under normal circumstances.<br> The circumstances are not normal.<br> We're carrying over 100 valuable Federation passengers.<br> We're being pursued by an alien ship, we're subject to possible attack.<br> There has been murder and attempted murder onboard.<br> - I cannot dismiss my duties.<br> - Duty? Your duty is to your father.<br> I know.<br> But this must take precedence.<br> If I could give the transfusion without loss of time or efficiency, I would.<br> Sarek understands my reason.<br> Well, I don't.<br> It's not human.<br> Oh, that's not a dirty word.<br> You're human too.<br> Let that part of you come through.<br> Your father's dying.<br> Mother, how can you have lived on Vulcan so long, married a Vulcan, raised a son on Vulcan, without understanding what it means to be a Vulcan? Well, if this is what it means, I don't want to know.<br> It means to adopt a philosophy, a way of life, which is logical and beneficial.<br> We cannot disregard that philosophy merely for personal gain, no matter how important that gain might be.<br> Nothing is as important as your father's life.<br> Can you imagine what my father would say if I were to agree? If I were to give up command of this vessel, jeopardise hundreds of lives, risk interplanetary war, all for the life of one person? When you were five years old and came home stiff-lipped, anguished because the other boys tormented you, saying that you weren't really Vulcan I watched you, knowing that inside the human part of you was crying.<br> And I cried too.<br> There must be some part of me in you.<br> Some part that I still can reach.<br> If being Vulcan is more important to you, then you'll stand there speaking rules and regulations from Starfleet and Vulcan philosophy and let your father die.<br> And I'll hate you for the rest of my life.<br> Mother Oh, go to him now.<br> Please.<br> I cannot.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I'd like to get my hands on the guy with the sledgehammer.<br> The one who hit you? No, the one inside my head.<br> How long have l.<br>.<br>? Now, let that be a lesson to you.<br> Just lie there and be happy you're still alive.<br> How's Sarek? Not good.<br> If I could only operate What's stopping you? I thought you were all ready.<br> I was.<br> When you became injured, Spock assumed command.<br> He's going to stay there till you get back on your feet, even if it costs Sarek his life.<br> Regulations.<br> I can't damn him for his loyalty.<br> For doing his duty.<br> But I'm not going to let him commit patricide.<br> Jim, if you stand, you could start to bleed again.<br> Bones Sarek will die without that operation.<br> And you can't operate without transfusions from Spock.<br> I'll convince Spock I'm all right and order him to report here.<br> Soon as he leaves the Bridge, I'll turn command over to Scotty and report to my quarters.<br> Will that fill your prescription? - Captain.<br> - I'll take over, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You report to Sickbay with Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Captain, are you quite all right? I've certified him physically fit, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Now, since I have an operation to perform, - and both of us are required - Get out, Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, what's the status of the intruder?

Moving away, turning now.<br> He's coming around again.<br> Fire as he passes, ensign.<br> Clean miss, sir.<br> Report on his weaponry, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Sensors record standard phasers, sir.<br> Standard phasers.<br> Good.<br> They have more speed, but they're not giants.<br> Captain, the intercoms are jammed.<br> All the ambassadors are asking what's going on.<br> Tell them to take a good guess, but clear that board, lieutenant.<br> Aye, sir.<br> It's coming around again.<br> One more like that and I'm going to lose both these men.<br> Fire control locked into the computers, captain.<br> On my order, fire photon torpedoes two, four, and six.<br> - Widest possible scatter.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Fire.<br> Full spread missed, sir.<br> They're moving too fast for us.<br> - Doctor, his heart's stopped.<br> - Cardiostimulate.<br> The systems are off.<br> Then get me that old portable cardiostimulator.<br> Call Engineering and have Sickbay systems put on priority.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Number four shield has buckled, sir.<br> - Auxiliary power.<br> - Switching over.<br> Shields firming up.<br> Number four is still weak, sir.<br> If they hit us there again, it'll go altogether.<br> Your friends out there are good.<br> They'll have to destroy this ship to win.<br> That was intended from the beginning, captain.<br> You're not Andorian.<br> Who are you? Damage reports coming in, captain.<br> Every deck.<br> Damage control procedures, all decks.<br> That ship out there has phasers.<br> At least our weapons are alike.<br> Number two shield is gone, sir.<br> Engineering.<br> This is the captain.<br> Cut power on the port side except for phaser banks.<br> At my signal, cut starboard power.<br> Kirk out.<br> Who are you? Find your own answers, captain.<br> You haven't long to live.<br> You're a spy, surgically altered to pass as an Andorian, planted in the ambassador's party to use terror and murder to disrupt us, and prepare for this attack.<br> Speculation, captain.<br> Engineering, cut power on starboard side.<br> Maintain until further orders.<br> Chekov.<br> What are you doing? You speculate.<br> We're starting to drift, sir.<br> Shall I hold her on course? No.<br> Stand by your phasers, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Phasers standing by.<br> He's just hovering out there, sir.<br> Looking us over.<br> We're dead, as far as he knows.<br> You're baiting him.<br> You're trying to lure him in.<br> Here he comes.<br> Range decreasing.<br> Speed dropping close to sub-light.<br> Hold your fire, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Phasers locked on target.<br> Range closing.<br> Seventy-five thousand kilometres.<br> Fire.<br> Got him! Secure from general quarters.<br> Lieutenant, open a hailing frequency.<br> If they wish to surrender They could not surrender, captain.<br> They had orders to self-destruct.<br> Lieutenant, relay to Starfleet Command.<br> Tell them we have a prisoner.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Only temporarily, captain.<br> You see, I had orders to self-destruct too.<br> Slow poison.<br> Quite painless, actually, but there is no known antidote.<br> I anticipate another ten minutes of life.<br> Take him to Sickbay.<br> I seem to have miscalculated.<br> So did they.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, take over.<br> Bones? Are you quite through shaking this ship around? Spock, Sarek.<br> How are they? I don't mind telling you, you sure make it difficult for a surgeon trying - Bones! - Captain, come in.<br> That pig-headed Vulcan stamina.<br> I couldn't have pulled them through without it.<br> Some doctors have all the luck.<br> - Captain, I believe you'll find the alien - We damaged their ship.<br> They destroyed themselves to avoid capture.<br> Bones, Thelev's body will be brought to your lab.<br> I want an autopsy performed as soon as possible.<br> I think you'll find he's an Orion, doctor.<br> Orion? Intelligence reports that Orion smugglers have been raiding the Coridan system.<br> But what would they gain by an attack on Starfleet? Mutual suspicion and interplanetary war.<br> Yes, of course.<br> With Orion carefully neutral, they'd clean up by supplying dilithium to both sides and continue to raid Coridan.<br> The thing that confused me was the power utilisation curve.<br> It made them seem more powerful than a starship or anything known to us.<br> That ship was constructed for a suicide mission.<br> Since they never intended to return to their home base, they could use 100 percent power on their attacks.<br> The thing I don't understand is why I didn't think of it earlier.<br> You might have had something else on your mind.<br> It hardly seems likely.<br> No.<br> But thank you anyway.<br> And you, Sarek.<br> Would you also say thank you to your son? I don't understand.<br> For saving your life.<br> Spock acted in the only logical manner open to him.<br> One does not thank logic, Amanda.<br> Logic.<br> Logic.<br> I'm sick to death of logic.<br> Do you want to know how I feel about your logic? - Emotional, isn't she? - She has always been that way.<br> Indeed? Why did you marry her? At the time, it seemed the logical thing to do.<br> Bones.<br> No, no, I'm all right.<br> Now, if you keep arguing with your kindly family doctor, you're going to spend your next ten days right here.<br> If you cooperate, you'll be out in two.<br> Doctor, I think I'll return to my station now.<br> You are at your station, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, I believe you're enjoying all this.<br> Indeed, captain.<br> I've never seen him look so happy.<br> Shut up!

Look, Jim, I know what it means to you to lose a crewman.<br> That's only one down, Doctor.<br> There's over 400 more up there in orbit.<br> And if there's a Klingon down here there might be a Klingon ship up there somewhere.<br> Mr.<br> Scott picking up something on the sensors, sir.<br> Seems to be another ship.<br> Let's put it on the screen.<br> It's just at the edge of our sensor range, sir.<br> Hard to get an exact reading.<br> You think it's a Klingon ship?

What have you obtained from them in the past? Powders and liquids for the sick? We Klingons believe as you do.<br> The sick should die.<br> Only the strong should live.<br> Earthmen have promised to teach the youth of your tribes many things.<br> What? What things?

A man, sir, in there.<br> A dead man.<br> Exactly what it looks like.<br> - Death by natural causes, old age.<br> - That's quite impossible, doctor.<br> I ran a personnel check on this entire expedition before we beamed down.<br> I assure you that none of them were They've come to pay their respects to Alvin.<br> - I'm Captain Kirk of - You'll have to speak louder.<br> I say, I'm Captain Kirk of the USS Enterprise.<br> Who are you? I'm Robert Johnson.<br> And this is my wife, Elaine.<br> How old are you? How old are you? I'm Let me see.<br> I am 29.<br> And Elaine is I'm 27.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange, new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3478.<br>2.<br> On a routine mission to resupply the experimental colony at Gamma Hydra IV, we discovered a most unusual phenomenon.<br> Of the six members of the colony, none of whom were over 30, we found four had died, and two were dying of old age.<br> Mr.<br> Johnson, can you hear me? I can hear you.<br> I'm not deaf yet, you know.<br> Not yet.<br> Can you tell me what happened? What happened? Did your instruments show anything? Elaine was so beautiful.<br> So beautiful.<br> So beautiful.<br> He can hear you, Jim, but he doesn't understand.<br> Let's let him rest.<br> If they seem lucid, I'll be in the Briefing Room.<br> Stay seated.<br> Commodore Stocker, I've asked you to be a part of this briefing because Gamma Hydra IV falls within your administrative area.<br> I appreciate that, sir.<br> Dr.<br> Wallace, as an expert in endocrinology, I'd appreciate you working very closely with Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> - And Dr.<br> McCoy, would you fill them in? Well, the expedition is suffering from extreme old age and they're growing older by the minute, much older.<br> My examinations have turned up absolutely nothing.<br> In fact, I don't have a clue.<br> What about the atmosphere and environment, Mr.<br> Spock? Sensors reveal nothing which is inimical to human life.<br> The atmosphere screens out the usual amount of harmful cosmic rays.<br> We're close to the neutral zone between our Federation and the Romulan Empire.<br> It's possible the Romulans have a new weapon and are using this colony as guinea pigs.<br> I have already begun investigation into that possibility, captain.<br> Good.<br> I want you all to check out everything in your own departments.<br> No matter how remote, how far-fetched the notion, I want it run down.<br> We'll stay in orbit until we have the answer.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm sure you understand that I am anxious to get to Starbase 10 - to assume my new post.<br> - Yes, commodore.<br> We'll do everything we can to make your due date.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Doctor, is there something I can do for you? Well, be a little less the cool, efficient captain, and a little more the old friend.<br> How long has it been? Six years, four months and an odd number of days.<br> You mean you don't know? A long time.<br> Things wouldn't change if it started all over again, would it? You have your job, I have my ship.<br> And neither one of us will change.<br> You said it, I didn't.<br> In all those years, I only heard from you once.<br> A stargram when my husband died.<br> You know, you never asked me why I got married after we called it off.<br> Well, I supposed that you met someone you loved.<br> I met a man I admired, a great man.<br> In the same field as you.<br> You didn't have to give up a thing.<br> No.<br> Just you.<br> Captain Kirk, Mr.<br> Spock would like to see you on the Bridge.<br> I'm on my way.<br> - Standard orbit, captain.<br> - Maintain.<br> I've rechecked the sensors, captain.<br> Gamma Hydra IV checks out as a Class-M planet with a conventional oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, normal mass.<br> I can find nothing at all out of the ordinary.<br> And the comet that Astrophysics reported? We're running checks on it.<br> I've reached no conclusions yet.<br> The comet was a rogue and has never been investigated.<br> - Captain Kirk? - Yes, commodore? Facilities at Starbase 10 are much more complete than those onboard ship.<br> Seems to me your investigations would be facilitated if we proceeded there.<br> - I assure you all cooperation.<br> - Thank you.<br> I know you're anxious to get to the base, but we have a few facilities of our own here.<br> The Enterprise will do quite nicely.<br> I'll be in Engineering, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Maintain standard orbit, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> You already gave that command, sir.<br> Well, follow it.<br> Lieutenant Galway.<br> Doctor, may I speak to you for a moment, please? Of course.<br> Go right ahead.<br> Well, I know this is going to sound foolish, but, well, I seem to be having a little trouble hearing.<br> Well, it's probably nothing important.<br> I never had trouble before.<br> Well, don't worry about it.<br> Perhaps a little hypersonic treatment might clear it up.<br> Thank you.<br> Progress report, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> All research lines negative, captain.<br> Astronomical section reports a comet recently passed by.<br> Check into that.<br> I am doing that, captain, as per your previous order.<br> We discussed that earlier.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Let me know what you come up with.<br> I'll be in the Sickbay.<br> Acknowledged.<br> The last one.<br> Robert Johnson, cause of death: - Old age.<br> - You did what you could.<br> Which adds up to absolutely nothing.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy? This is Scott.<br> May I come up and see you? All you need are vitamins.<br> But you can come up anyhow.<br> Bones, I believe you're getting grey.<br> You take over my job and see what happens to you.<br> - I see what you mean.<br> - What's your problem, Jim? Shoulder.<br> Just a twinge.<br> Probably muscular strain.<br> You're probably right, doctor.<br> By the way, I don't like the way you've been running this ship lately.<br> All right, reprimand received.<br> Go ahead.<br> Jim, I think we'd better run a complete physical on you.<br> Why? Just muscular strain, isn't it? No, Jim.<br> It's advanced arthritis, and it's spreading.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - I can run it through again, but I'll come up with the same thing.<br> Scotty! Captain's log, stardate 3579.<br>4.<br> Of the Enterprise personnel who beamed down to the planet's surface, Dr.<br> McCoy, Engineer Scott, Mr.<br> Spock, Lieutenant Galway and myself are all showing definite signs of aging.<br> Only Ensign Chekov appears to be normal.<br> Report, Bones.<br> All of us who went down to the surface, with the exception of Chekov, are aging at various rates.<br> Approximately 30 years for each day.<br> I don't know what's causing it, virus, bacteria or evil spirits, but I'm trying to find out.<br> Spock? I asked for some figures.<br> Based on what Dr.<br> McCoy gave me, I estimate that physically we each have less than a week to live.<br> Also, since our mental faculties are aging faster than our bodies, we will be little better than mental vegetables in a considerably lesser time.<br> Total senility? Yes, captain.<br> In a very short time.<br> What a way to die.<br> All right.<br> I want all the research facilities, all the scientific technicians to start round-the-clock research immediately.<br> I want the answers, and I want the remedy! You might start by finding out why Chekov hasn't been affected.<br> I'm doing what I can.<br> - You're perfectly healthy.<br> - I must differ with you, doctor.<br> I'm having difficulty concentrating, which is most disturbing.<br> My eyesight appears to be failing.<br> The normal temperature of the ship seems to me to be increasingly cold.<br> I did not say you weren't affected, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You are perfectly healthy.<br> That is, for any normal Vulcan on the high side of 100.<br> Captain, can I go back to my station? - Do you feel up to it, Scotty? - Of course I do.<br> I just need a wee bit of rest, that's all.<br> You can leave too, Lieutenant Galway.<br> Lieutenant Galway.<br> What? You spoke to me, doctor? Yes, I spoke to you.<br> I said that you could leave too.<br> Now, why don't you go on down to your quarters and get some sleep? No, I don't wanna sleep.<br> Can't you understand? If I sleep, what will I find when I wake up? Lieutenant Galway, assume your position and start your duties.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> That's a stupid place to hang a mirror.<br> She's 10 years younger than I am.<br> She looks People age normally at different speeds.<br> Why hasn't he aged? - I don't know.<br> - Well, I wanna know! Is it his youth, his blood type, his heritage, his glands, his genes? \"His genes.<br>\" All right, nurse, prepare Chekov for another complete physical.<br> Come along, ensign.<br> This won't hurt much.<br> Promises.<br> A few years ago on Aldebaran III, my husband and I tried various carbohydrate compounds to slow down the degeneration of plant life.<br> Well, then try that, Dr.<br> Wallace.<br> - Try anything, but do it quickly.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> I'll be on the Bridge.<br> Keep me posted as to Chekov.<br> I thought you were on your way to the biochemistry lab, doctor.<br> We're both going the same direction.<br> So we do.<br> Look, we know the problem.<br> We know the progress of the affliction.<br> Therefore, once we find the proper line of research, it's only logical we find a solution.<br> You sound like my first officer.<br> No problem is insoluble, not even ours.<br> That didn't spring from logic.<br> Our situation doesn't have its roots in logic.<br> The heart is not a logical organ.<br> When I married Theodore Wallace, I thought I was over you.<br> I was wrong.<br> When did you realise that? Today? What? How much older was your husband? - What difference does that make? - Answer me.<br> Twenty-six years.<br> - That's quite a difference.<br> - Jim, he was a brilliant man.<br> We were stationed on a lonely outpost.<br> We were working together.<br> I don't wanna talk about him.<br> I wanna talk about us.<br> Look at me.<br> Look at me.<br> What do you see? I see Captain James Kirk.<br> A man of morality, decency, handsome and strong And old.<br> - And rapidly growing older.<br> - Jim, please.<br> What are you offering me, Jan? Love? Or a going-away present? \"Give us some more blood, Chekov.<br> The needle won't hurt, Chekov.<br> Take off your shirt, Chekov.<br> Roll over, Chekov.<br> Breathe deeply, Chekov.<br> Blood sample, Chekov.<br> Marrow sample, Chekov.<br> Skin sample, Chekov.<br>\" If If I live long enough, I'm going to run out of samples.<br> You'll live.<br> Oh, yes, I'll live, but I won't enjoy it.<br> Maintaining standard orbit, captain.<br> Increase orbit to 20,000 perigee, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Will you sign this, sir? Yeoman.<br> Do you have a reason for being on the Bridge, Commodore Stocker? I had hoped for a few words with you at your convenience.<br> I have very little time.<br> If I may say so, sir, we have a due date at Starbase 10.<br> We're going to be late.<br> I don't intend to leave this area until we've found a solution for this problem.<br> Captain, I am watching four very valuable, one almost irreplaceable, members of the Starfleet failing before my eyes.<br> I want to do something to help.<br> Since you're so concerned, I'll send a message to Starbase 10.<br> Captain, you sent such a message this morning.<br> Yeoman! Where's that - Sir? fuel consumption report? I gave it to you, sir.<br> You signed it.<br> If I had signed it, I wouldn't ask for it, now, would I? Your signature, captain.<br> Captain, I believe Captain? Captain? - Spock, I was just thinking.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Quite understandable.<br> - You have something to report? - Yes, sir.<br> I believe we have the cause of the affliction.<br> - What is it? - The orbit of Gamma Hydra IV carried the planet directly through the comet's trail.<br> On conventional radiation settings, we discovered nothing.<br> When resetting our sensors to the extreme lower range of the scale, undetected radiation appeared.<br> Below normal radiation levels, but definitely present, and undoubtedly residue from the comet.<br> Good, Spock.<br> Well done.<br> Let's get this to Dr.<br> McCoy immediately.<br> Lieutenant, take a message to Starfleet Command.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Due to the proximity of the Romulans, better use Code 2.<br> But, captain, the Romulans have broken Code 2.<br> - If you remember the last bulletin - Then use Code 3.<br> - Yes, sir, Code 3.<br> - Message: Key to affliction may be comet which passed by Gamma Hydra IV.<br> Said comet is now - Quadrant 448, sir.<br> - Quadrant All units are to be alerted for complete analysis of radiation and means found to neutralise it.<br> The comet is highly dangerous.<br> Kirk, commanding Enterprise.<br> - Immediately, lieutenant.<br> Let's go.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Oh, Mr.<br> Sulu, increase orbit to 20,000-mile perigee.<br> You mean another 20,000, captain? I fail to understand why each one of my commands is being questioned.<br> Now, do as you're told, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, what is our present position? Orbiting at 20,000, sir.<br> - Maintain.<br> - Maintaining, sir.<br> Radiation.<br> Well, that's as good an answer as any, but why didn't we know about it earlier? Possibly, doctor, because my thinking processes are not as efficient as before.<br> Run this through, doctor.<br> All right, Bones.<br> I'm going up to the Bridge.<br> Keep me posted.<br> Spock.<br> I have a question for the doctor.<br> Doctor, the ship's temperature is increasingly uncomfortable for me.<br> I've adjusted the environment in my quarters to 125 degrees, which is at least tolerable.<br> However, l Well, I see I'm not gonna be making any house calls on you.<br> I wondered if perhaps there was something which could lower my sensitivity to cold.<br> I'm not a magician, Spock, just an old country doctor.<br> Yes.<br> As I always suspected.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, none of our usual radiation therapies will have any effect on this radiation sickness.<br> Well, then we just start over, that's all.<br> We work harder, faster, and we start completely from scratch if we have to.<br> But we find something.<br> Spock, can I have a word with you? - Commodore? - Mr.<br> Spock, a starship can function with a chief engineer and a chief medical officer, even a first officer, under physical par.<br> But it is disastrous to have a commanding officer whose condition is any less than perfection.<br> - I am aware of that.<br> - Please understand me.<br> My admiration for Captain Kirk is unbounded.<br> He is a great officer.<br> But, Mr.<br> Spock, I need your help and your cooperation.<br> For what, sir? I would like you to take over command of the Enterprise.<br> On what grounds, commodore? On the grounds that the captain, because of his affliction, is unable to perform his duties.<br> Need I remind you, sir, that I too have contracted the same affliction? Yes, but you're a Vulcan.<br> You have a much greater life span.<br> You show the effects to a much smaller degree.<br> I am half human, sir.<br> My physical reflexes are down, my mental capacities reduced, I tire easily.<br> No, sir.<br> I am not fit for command.<br> Well, if you are not with your Vulcan physique, then obviously Captain Kirk cannot be.<br> Sir, I do have duties to perform.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I do not like what I am about to say but regulations demand it, and as a Starfleet flag officer, I must follow regulations.<br> As second-in-command of the Enterprise, you must convene an extraordinary competency hearing.<br> I resist that suggestion, commodore.<br> It's not a matter of choice.<br> When a captain is unfit physically or mentally, a competency hearing is mandatory.<br> Don't make me quote a regulation which you know as well as I do.<br> Very well, sir.<br> The hearing shall convene at 1400 hours.<br> - Now, this isn't gonna hurt a bit.<br> - That's what you said the last time.<br> - Did it hurt? - Yes.<br> Doctor Bones.<br> She's dead.<br> Her metabolism caused her to age more rapidly than the rest of us, but the same thing's gonna happen to us unless How long have we got, Bones? A matter of days, perhaps hours.<br> Let it read that this competency hearing was ordered by Commodore Stocker and reluctantly called by myself.<br> Let it also read that I consider it invalid.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, may I make a statement? I have had to resort to these legal grounds in order to save the lives of some very valuable members of the Starfleet.<br> I have tried to convince Captain Kirk of the necessity of proceeding to Starbase 10, but have been overruled in each case.<br> The responsibility of this hearing is mine.<br> On the contrary, commodore, as presiding officer and second-in-command of the Enterprise, the responsibility is mine.<br> Captain Kirk, would you like to make a statement? Yes, I would like to make a statement.<br> I am the captain of this ship and I'm totally capable of commanding her.<br> Let's call this whole thing off and get back to work.<br> It's quite impossible, captain.<br> The regulations are quite specific.<br> You are entitled to direct examination of all witnesses immediately after the board has questioned them.<br> That's very kind of you, Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, how long have you served with Captain Kirk? - Two years, sir.<br> - To your knowledge, has he ever had any difficulty making decisions? No, sir.<br> Did he order you to maintain standard orbit around Gamma Hydra IV? Yes, sir.<br> Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? Yes, sir.<br> - Did he order you to increase orbit? - Yes, sir.<br> Did he not, several minutes later, repeat that order? He did not! When I give an order, I expect it to be obeyed.<br> I don't have to repeat myself.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, you'll please answer the question.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain Kirk repeated his order.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Atkins.<br> You handed Captain Kirk a fuel-consumption report in the presence of witnesses, which he read and signed.<br> Is that correct? Sir, he had more important things on his mind.<br> - The present - Yeoman, you will simply answer the question.<br> L I guess he forgot he'd signed it.<br> You guess? He forgot he'd signed it.<br> Thank you, yeoman.<br> You may leave.<br> Lieutenant Uhura.<br> I have here a bulletin from Starfleet Command which states that the Romulans had broken Code 2.<br> Are these your initials which appear at the bottom? They are.<br> And whose initials are those which appear directly below yours? Those of Captain Kirk.<br> Did Captain Kirk ask you to send a message about the comet which passed Gamma Hydra IV? - He did.<br> - Using Code 2? Oh, yes, but he changed it to Code 3.<br> After you reminded him that the Romulans had broken Code 2.<br> - Yes.<br> - Thank you, lieutenant.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Yeah.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock, what is it? Several hours ago, at the request of this board, you ran a complete physical examination of Captain Kirk.<br> I did.<br> Medical banks.<br> Compute, describe subject's physical age, using established norms as comparative base.<br> Working.<br> Subject's physical age, based on physiological profile, between 60 and 72, aging rapidly.<br> Oh, I'm thirty-f I'm 34 years old.<br> The computer differs with you, captain.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Yes? Will you give us your professional evaluation of Captain Kirk's present physical condition? Captain Kirk is suffering from a peculiar physical degeneration which strongly resembles aging.<br> Is not his mental capacity degenerating even more rapidly? - Yes, but he's a better man now - Doctor, you heard the computer's analysis of Captain Kirk's physical age.<br> Do you agree with it? Blasted machines.<br> Spock, you can't argue with a machine.<br> Do you agree with it, doctor? Yes.<br> Yes, I do agree.<br> And I am sorry, Jim.<br> This board has no further questions.<br> Unless you, Commodore Stocker, have something you would like to add.<br> No.<br> I am quite satisfied, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Do you wish to call any witnesses, Captain Kirk? I'm perfectly capable of speaking in my own defence, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Captain, I would suggest - No, it's all right, Spock.<br> It's all right.<br> There's only one reason, and one reason alone for having this hearing.<br> I refuse to leave Gamma Hydra II.<br> Gamma Hydra IV, captain.<br> Yes.<br> A slip of the tongue.<br> Captain, your inability to remember having given commands, reading and signing important orders and then forgetting them, your physical analysis as compiled by your own chief surgeon, all of these things would appear to be irrefutable proof of failing physical and mental condition.<br> So I'm a little confused.<br> Who wouldn't be at a time like this? My ship's in trouble, my senior officers are ill, and this nonsense about a competency hearing is enough to mix up any man.<br> Trying to relieve a captain of his command is Why, that's That's Spock.<br> I wouldn't have believed it of you.<br> Go ahead.<br> Ask me questions.<br> I'll show you what I'm capable of.<br> Nothing wrong with my memory.<br> Go ahead, ask me anything.<br> We're in orbit around Gamma Hydra II, right? Anyhow, it doesn't matter.<br> There's a lot more to running a starship than answering a lot of fool questions.<br> A lot more.<br> - Go ahead, ask me a question.<br> - We have no more questions, captain.<br> Ask me anything.<br> Anything.<br> There will be no more questions, captain.<br> If you would leave the room so the board can vote Good idea.<br> Get this stupid voting over with so I can get back to running the ship.<br> Worst fool thing I ever heard of.<br> Competency hearing when there's work to be done.<br> I'll be in my quarters awaiting your decision.<br> Well, since the senior officers are incapable, and I am of flag rank, I am forced by regulations to assume command.<br> Sir, you have never commanded a starship.<br> What would you have, Mr.<br> Spock, a junior officer with far less experience than I have? - The danger from the Romulans - We have to save these people.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Set a direct course for Starbase 10.<br> Warp 5.<br> - Across the neutral zone? - Immediately, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> All officers are to return to their posts.<br> Spock? Yes, captain.<br> So I've been relieved.<br> - I'm sorry, captain.<br> - Yes.<br> You should have been a prosecuting attorney.<br> - Regulations required - Regulations.<br> Don't give me regulations.<br> You've wanted command all along.<br> The first little excuse you get - Captain, I've not assumed command.<br> - I hope you're proud of the What do you mean, you've not assumed command? - I suffer the same affliction as you.<br> - If you're not in command, who is? - Commodore Stocker.<br> - Stocker? Are you crazy? - He's never had a field command.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott was unfit for command.<br> Commodore Stocker, as ranking officer Don't Don't talk to me about rank! The man's a chair-bound paper-pusher! - I order you to take command.<br> - I cannot, captain.<br> - Are you refusing a direct order? - No, sir.<br> Only Commodore Stocker can give a command order onboard this ship.<br> You traitorous disloyal You stab me in the back the first chance you get.<br> Spock.<br> Get out.<br> I never wanna have to look at you again.<br> Jan.<br> Oh, Jim, I'm sorry.<br> Truly, I am.<br> I made a fool of myself in there.<br> I shouldn't have let them confuse me, rattle me.<br> Everybody understood.<br> But I'm not old, Jan.<br> I'm not.<br> A few muscular aches doesn't make a man old.<br> You don't run a starship with your arms, you run it with your head.<br> And my brain's as sharp as it ever was.<br> A simple case of radiation poisoning, they relieve me of my command? I admit I'm getting a little grey, but radiation will do that to you.<br> - Forgive me, I have some work to do.<br> - Jan.<br> You know me.<br> Look at me closely.<br> Tell me, am I getting old? What are you doing here? It would seem to be the place where I can be of the most use.<br> Maybe you'd like to relieve Dr.<br> McCoy? - What about Chekov? - Nothing.<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> Bones, there has to be.<br> There has to be.<br> We beamed down together.<br> We were on the surface together on the same spot.<br> - We were together all the time.<br> - No, not all the time, captain.<br> - He left us for a few moments.<br> - He left us? He left us.<br> He went into the building.<br> Spock, something happened.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, indeed, captain.<br> Doctor, you will remember He was scared.<br> He saw the dead body.<br> And he ran out of the building and he was scared to death.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, now that That could be.<br> Frightened, scared.<br> Heart beats faster, breath gets short, and has cold sweats.<br> Adrenaline flows.<br> Adrenal activity.<br> Now, hold on just a minute now.<br> There's something that I read once.<br> It was ancient history, just after the atomic age.<br> Used for radiation sickness.<br> Adrenaline! Doctor, hyronalin is the specific accepted for all radiation sickness.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, now.<br> But before, adrenaline.<br> Highly promising.<br> Early research.<br> But they abandoned it when hyronalin was discovered.<br> Quite possible, doctor.<br> Perhaps a sufficiently efficacious compound could be developed.<br> Don't just stand there jawing, Spock.<br> You and Dr.<br> Wallace get cracking! Entering Romulan Neutral Zone, sir.<br> All sensors on maximum.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, let me know if we contact any Romulan.<br> I think we just made contact, sir.<br> Romulans approaching from both sides, sir.<br> - We're bracketed, sir.<br> - Engineering wants instructions, sir.<br> Commodore Stocker, what are your orders? Commodore! - I'm going up to the Bridge.<br> - No, Jim, you can't do it.<br> I've got to go.<br> We're under attack.<br> Nurse! Dr.<br> Wallace! - Let me go.<br> - Jim, you can't.<br> We're under attack.<br> I have to go to the Bridge.<br> I've got to go to the Bridge.<br> - Keep trying to raise the Romulans.<br> - I'm trying, commodore.<br> If I could talk to them, explain to them why we violated the neutral zone The Romulans are notorious for not listening to explanations, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura is right, sir.<br> We've tangled with them before.<br> Greenhorn up there, ruining my ship.<br> - Jim, if I have to give you a shot - No.<br> Jim, boy, you just lay quiet.<br> You can't do no good.<br> We're both through.<br> No.<br> No.<br> My ship.<br> My ship.<br> Doctor, make the necessary computations and produce this serum.<br> It is crude and dangerous.<br> We had no time for refinements.<br> All right.<br> Let's Let's go.<br> It could cure or kill, doctor.<br> Don't give me any Vulcan details, Spock.<br> - Just give me the shot.<br> - No.<br> - I'll take the first shot.<br> - You can't.<br> How long do you think this ship can take the pounding?

The aging process has stopped.<br> His bodily functions are getting stronger.<br> Sir, I've tried all known hailing frequencies.<br> They simply ignore us.<br> Opinion, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> They know they have us.<br> They know our shields will give out.<br> Well, then we have no alternative but to surrender.<br> Sir, the Romulans do not take captives.<br> - We're losing power, sir.<br> - What am I going to do? I've got to do something.<br> Report, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> We're surrounded by Romulan vessels, maximum of 10.<br> Range: 50 to 100,000 kilometres.<br> Engineering, this is the captain.<br> I want full emergency power.<br> I want everything within about two minutes.<br> I want the warp-drive engines on full standby.<br> Kirk out.<br> Open up a special channel to Starfleet Command.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Code 2.<br> But, captain, Code That's an order, lieutenant.<br> Code 2.<br> - Yes, captain, Code 2.<br> - Message: From Enterprise to Starfleet Command, this sector.<br> Have inadvertently encroached upon Romulan Neutral Zone.<br> Surrounded and under heavy Romulan attack.<br> Escape impossible, shields failing.<br> Will implement destruct order using corbomite device recently installed.<br> Since this will result in the destruction of the Enterprise and all matter within a 200,000-kilometre diameter, and establish a corresponding dead zone, all Federation ships will avoid this area for the next four solar years.<br> Explosion will take place in one minute.<br> Kirk, commanding Enterprise.<br> Out.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, course: Speed: Warp factor 8.<br> - Stand by.<br> - Standing by, sir.<br> Romulans giving ground, captain.<br> Obviously they tapped in as you expected them to.<br> A logical assumption, Spock.<br> Are they still retreating? - Yes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> All hands, stand by.<br> Warp factor 8, now.<br> The Romulans were caught off-guard, captain.<br> - They're falling behind.<br> - Are we out of range, Mr.<br> Sulu? - Yes, sir.<br> And out of the neutral zone.<br> - Secure from red alert.<br> Adjust to new course.<br> heading for Starbase 10.<br> Captain, I just wanted to assure you that I did what I thought best - to save both you and the men.<br> - Noted.<br> You should know, however, that there's very little a starbase can do that a starship can't.<br> If I may say so, captain, I am now quite aware of what a starship can do with the right man at the helm.<br> You're looking good, doc.<br> I'm feeling fine.<br> So is Scotty.<br> The serum worked.<br> He pulled a muscle during the reaction, but otherwise he's feeling fine.<br> - And yourself? - Oh, very well.<br> A few bruises here and there.<br> Anytime you're ready, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I am quite ready now, doctor.<br> Because of your Vulcan physique, I've prepared an extremely potent shot for you.<br> I thought you might like to know I've removed the breakables from Sickbay.<br> That is very considerate of you, doctor.<br> I thought you'd be pleased to hear that.<br> Gentlemen, all in all, an experience we'll remember in our old age, which won't be for some while, I hope.<br> Take over, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Steady as she goes.<br> - Steady as she goes, captain.<br> - I thought I said that.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Continuing scanning, captain.<br> Still no readings of life forms on the planet surface.<br> Let's assume that it's something so completely different that our sensors would not identify it as a life form.<br> You mentioned dikironium, captain.<br> Suppose it was composed of that rare element.<br> A strange, gaseous creature.<br> I have scanned for that element, captain.<br> There is no trace of dikironium on the planet surface or in the atmosphere.<br> Suppose it camouflaged itself.<br> Let's assume that it's intelligent, that it knows that we're looking for it.<br> To hide from a sensor scan, it would have to be able to change its molecular structure.<br> Like gold changing itself to lead, or wood changing itself to ivory.<br> You've just suggested something that never occurred to me.<br> It may provide some answers to a tape record which I think you'll find Dr.<br> McCoy is looking at this very moment.<br> Chekov, take over on scanner.<br> Ensign Garrovick reporting, sir.<br> - Are you the new security officer? - Yes, sir.<br> - Was your father.<br>.<br>? - Yes, sir, he was.<br> But I don't expect any special treatment on that account.<br> - You'll get none aboard this ship.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Captain, I have a report on Ensign Rizzo.<br> He's dead, sir.<br> You knew Rizzo? Yes, sir.<br> We were good friends.<br> Graduated the Academy together.<br> You'll get a crack at what killed him.<br> Interested? - Yes, I am, sir.<br> - I want four men armed with phaser-twos set for disruptor effect.<br> Join me in the Transporter Room in five minutes.<br> You'll accompany me to the planet's surface.<br> Yes, sir.<br> The reading is changing, sir.<br> Spock was right.<br> Notice the molecular shift.<br> Dikironium reading now, sir.<br> Bearing 94, mark 7.<br> Angle of elevation, 6 degrees.<br> - Holding steady.<br> - Over that rise.<br> Take two men, circle around to the left.<br> I'll take the other two and go the other way.<br> That creature is dangerous.<br> If you see it, fire full phasers.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Bensen, Bardoli, come with me.<br> A phaser! Come on! Garrovick, did you.<br>.<br>? Captain's log, stardate 3619.<br>6.<br> One of the men in critical condition, the other is dead.<br> And l I am now even more convinced that this is not only an intelligent creature, but the same which decimated the crew of the USS Farragut in another part of the galaxy.<br> Both Spock and McCoy are doubtful of this, and I sense they also doubt my decision to stay and fight the thing.<br> Why am I keeping the ship here? Ensign Garrovick, we've studied your report.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, will you begin? What was the size of the thing you saw, ensign? I'd say it measured from 10 to 60 cubic metres, sir.<br> It varied in size, fluctuated as it moved.<br> - Composition? - It was like a A gaseous cloud.<br> Parts of it, I could see through.<br> Other parts were more dense.<br> Ensign, did you sense any intelligence in this gaseous cloud? - Did I what, sir? - Did you get any subconscious impressions that this was a creature, a living, thinking thing, rather than just a strange cloud of chemical elements? No, sir.<br> But you didn't come into actual contact with it, did you? No, sir, I was furthest away from it.<br> It seemed to come out of nowhere, hovered for a moment, then moved toward my men.<br> It was fast, incredibly fast.<br> - Did you say it hovered? - Yes, sir.<br> - You did fire at it, didn't you? - Yes, sir, I did.<br> What distance were you from the creature? About 20 yards, sir.<br> You fired at a large hovering target at that distance, and missed? Yes.<br> Well, I didn't fire while it was hovering, sir.<br> You mean you froze? No.<br> Sir, - I didn't exactly freeze.<br> - Well, what exactly were you doing? Well, I was startled for a second, and then by the time I fired, the thing was already moving.<br> Do you have any further information? - No, sir.<br> - You have any further questions? I only hesitated for a moment, sir.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Ensign, you're relieved of all duties and confined to quarters - until further notice.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - You were a little hard on the boy.<br> - He froze.<br> One man was killed, another may die.<br> Captain, scientifically You'll both be filing reports.<br> Make your comments and recommendations then.<br> Captain, while we wait, I've taken the liberty of cleaning the radioactive disposal vent on Number 2 lmpulse Engine, but we'll be ready to leave orbit in half an hour.<br> We're not leaving orbit, Mr.<br> Scott, not that quickly.<br> - Captain.<br> - Yes? Yorktown requesting information on how soon - we expect to rendezvous with them.<br> - Thank you.<br> The medicine for Theta Vll colony is not only needed desperately, - it has a limited stability - I'm aware of the situation, engineer.<br> And I'm getting a little tired of my senior officers conspiring against me.<br> Forgive me.<br> Perhaps I shouldn't have used the word \"conspired.<br>\" Agreed, sir.<br> - Scanner readings.<br> - Nothing, sir.<br> Continuing to scan.<br> Are you aware that it can change its molecular structure? - Yes, sir.<br> - Are you scanning for any unusual movement? - Yes, sir.<br> - Any type of gaseous cloud? We've run a full scanner probe twice.<br> Well, then run it 20 times, if that's what it takes.<br> I hope I'm not disturbing you, doctor.<br> Interrupting another autopsy report is no disturbance, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It's a relief.<br> I need your advice.<br> Then I need a drink.<br> I do not understand your reasoning.<br> You need advice from me? You must be kidding.<br> I do not joke, doctor.<br> Perhaps I should rephrase my statement.<br> I require an opinion.<br> There are many aspects of human irrationality I do not yet comprehend.<br> Obsession, for one.<br> The persistent, single-minded fixation on one idea.<br> - Jim and his creature.<br> - Precisely.<br> Have you studied the incident involving the USS Farragut? No, with all these deaths and injuries, I've only had a chance to scan the tapes.<br> There are eight or ten hours of record tapes there.<br> Fortunately, I read somewhat faster.<br> In brief, doctor, nearly half the crew and the captain were annihilated.<br> The captain's name was Garrovick.<br> - The same as our ensign.<br> - His father.<br> Among the survivors was a young officer on his first deep-space assignment: James T.<br> Kirk.<br> And there is still more.<br> I suggest you study this.<br> Personal log, stardate 3620.<br>7.<br> Have I the right to jeopardise my crew, my ship, for a feeling I can't even put into words? No man achieves Starfleet Command without relying on intuition, but have I made a rational decision? Am I letting the horrors of the past distort my judgement of the present? Mind if I come in? Kirk to Bridge.<br> Scanner report.<br> Continuing scanning, sir.<br> No unusual readings.<br> Maintain search.<br> Kirk out.<br> It can't have just vanished.<br> Sometimes they do, if we're lucky.<br> Monsters come in many forms.<br> And you know the greatest monster of them all, Jim? - Guilt.<br> - Get to the point.<br> Jim, when a young officer is exposed to unknown dangers for the first time, he's under tremendous emotional stress.<br> Now, we all know that Ensign Garrovick is a ship-command decision.<br> You're straying out of your field, doctor.<br> Am I? I was speaking of Lieutenant James T.<br> Kirk of the starship Farragut.<br> Eleven years ago, you were the young officer at the phaser station when something attacked.<br> According to the tapes, this young Lieutenant Kirk insisted upon blaming himself.<br> Because I delayed in firing at it.<br> You had a normal emotion.<br> You were startled.<br> You delayed firing for a grand total of perhaps two seconds.<br> If I hadn't delayed, it would have been killed.<br> The ship's exec didn't seem to think so.<br> His log entry was quite clear on the subject: \"Lieutenant Kirk is a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery.<br>\" Don't you understand? It killed 200 crewmen.<br> Captain Garrovick was very important to you, wasn't he, Jim? Yes.<br> He was my commanding officer from the day I left the Academy.<br> One of the finest men I ever knew.<br> I could've killed that thing if I had fired soon enough the first time.<br> You don't know that, Jim.<br> You don't know that any more than you know that Garrovick could've destroyed it.<br> I can't help how I feel.<br> There's an intelligence about it, Bones.<br> A malevolence.<br> It's evil.<br> It must be destroyed.<br> Don't be so obsessed.<br> Obsessed? That you could destroy yourself, your career.<br> A young boy who reminds you of yourself 11 years ago.<br> Don't push our friendship past the point where I have to take I'm not, Jim! This is professional, captain.<br> I am preparing a medical-log entry on my estimation of the physical and emotional condition of a starship captain.<br> Which requires a witness of command grade.<br> Do I take it, doctor, commander, that both of you, or either of you, consider me unfit or incapacitated? Correctly phrased, captain, as recommended in the manual.<br> Our reply, also as recommended, is: Sir, we have noted in your recent behaviour certain items which on the surface seem unusual.<br> We respectfully ask permission to enquire further and Blast it, forget the manual! Ask your questions.<br> Sir, the USS Yorktown is waiting now at the rendezvous point.<br> - It carries perishable drugs - Forget the recitation.<br> I know the facts.<br> They need those vaccines on Theta Vll, captain.<br> Now, why are we delaying here? Because I'm convinced that this is the same creature that attacked the Farragut - \"Creature,\" captain? - My report is on the tapes.<br> As it attacked us 11 years ago, as I lost consciousness, I could feel the intelligence of the thing.<br> I could sense it thinking, planning.<br> You say you could sense its intelligence, captain.<br> How? Did it communicate with you? You state that it happened just as you lost consciousness.<br> Now, the semiconscious mind is a very tricky thing.<br> A man never knows just how much is real or how much is imagination.<br> Whatever it is, doctor, whatever it is, - wouldn't you call it deadly? - Yes, there's no doubt about that.<br> And what if it is the same creature that attacked 11 years ago from a planet over 1000 light years from here? Obviously, captain, if it is an intelligent creature, if it is the same one, if it therefore is capable of space travel, it could pose a grave threat to inhabited planets.<br> A lot of \"ifs,\" I agree.<br> But in my command judgement, they outweigh other factors.<br> Intuition, however illogical, Mr.<br> Spock, is recognised as a command prerogative.<br> - We're not trying to gang up on you.<br> - And you haven't, doctor.<br> You've expressed the proper concern, you've asked the proper questions.<br> You've both done your duty.<br> Now, may I ask what medical-log entry you intend to make? At this point, my medical log remains open.<br> In that case, gentlemen - Bridge to captain.<br> Come in.<br> - Kirk here.<br> I have a reading on the whatever it is, captain.<br> Leaving the planet surface, heading into space.<br> All decks, red alert.<br> Red alert.<br> Prepare to leave orbit.<br> Captain, we can't maintain warp 8 speed much longer.<br> Pressures are approaching the critical point.<br> Range, Mr.<br> Chekov? Our phasers won't reach it, sir.<br> We are barely closing on it, captain.<br> We could be pursuing it for days.<br> If necessary.<br> Do what you can to increase our speed, Scott.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Extreme magnification, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Magnification 12.<br> There, sir.<br> There, got it.<br> Spock, how do you read that? Conflicting data, captain.<br> It seems to be in a borderline state between matter and energy, elements of both.<br> It could possibly use gravitational fields for propulsion.<br> And you don't find that sophisticated, Mr.<br> Spock? Extremely efficient, captain.<br> Whether that indicates intelligence is another matter.<br> Open hatch on lmpulse Engine Number 2.<br> Mr.<br> Scott was doing an AID cleanup on it.<br> We won't be using the impulse engines.<br> Turn the alarm off.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Captain, we can't do it.<br> If we keep this speed, we'll blow up any minute now.<br> Go to warp 6.<br> Hi.<br> Everyone else is at alert stations, so I brought you some dinner.<br> - I'm not hungry.<br> - Doctor's orders.<br> What's happening? Are we still chasing that thing halfway across the galaxy? Yes.<br> Has the captain lost his sense of balance? Maybe.<br> Is the entire crew about ready to explode? Positively.<br> - You're lucky you're out of it.<br> - What do you mean, out of it? I caused it.<br> You know that too, don't you? If I'd fired my phaser quickly enough on Argus X, this wouldn't have happened.<br> Your self-pity is a terrible first course.<br> Why don't you try the soup instead? I told you, Christine, I'm not hungry.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy thought you might say something like that.<br> This is his officially logged prescription for you.<br> It has one word on it: \"Eat.<br>\" Now, if you don't follow his orders, Dr.<br> McCoy could, and possibly would, have you hauled down to Sickbay and fed intravenously.<br> - What's that? - This? \"A Survey on Cygnian Respiratory Diseases\"? I thought you took Garrovick some food.<br> What were you doing with this? Applying psychology.<br> The creature is slowing.<br> It's down to warp 2.<br> Reduce speed.<br> Approach slowly.<br> I don't understand.<br> It was outrunning us.<br> Maybe it's decided to fight.<br> - Phasers ready? - Phasers show ready, sir.<br> Battle stations.<br> All decks to battle stations.<br> This is not a drill.<br> All decks to battle stations.<br> Scanner to Bridge.<br> It's coming to a full halt, sir.<br> Magnification 1.<br> Move in closely, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Sublight one-quarter speed.<br> Captain, request permission to return to my post.<br> Within phaser range, sir.<br> Lock all phasers on target.<br> - Locked on target.<br> - Fire phasers, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Phasers ineffectual, sir.<br> Photon torpedoes.<br> Minimum spread pattern.<br> Minimum pattern ready, sir.<br> Fire photon torpedoes.<br> There.<br> It's coming, sir.<br> - Deflectors up.<br> - Deflectors up, sir.<br> - The deflectors will not stop it, captain.<br> - That's impossible! I should have surmised this.<br> For the creature to be able to use gravity as a propulsive force, it would have to have this capacity.<br> Five seconds to contact.<br> All hatches and vents secure.<br> All lights on the board show green.<br> Sir! The Number 2 lmpulse Vent, we have a red light on it.<br> Captain, something's entered through the Number 2 lmpulse Vent.<br> Negative pressure in all ship's vents.<br> Alert all decks.<br> Report.<br> When it entered lmpulse Engine Number 2's vent, it attacked two crewmen, then got into the ventilating system, and now we have air for only two hours.<br> - Bones.<br> - One man has a chance for survival, the other is dead.<br> You can add that little price tag to your monster hunt.<br> - That's enough, Bones.<br> - It's not enough! You didn't care, as long as you could hang your trophy on the wall.<br> Well, it's not on it, captain.<br> It's in it.<br> Gentlemen, may I suggest we no longer belabour the question of whether or not we should have gone after the creature.<br> The matter has been rendered academic.<br> The creature is now after us.<br> - \"Creature,\" Mr.<br> Spock? - It turned and attacked, doctor.<br> Its method was well-considered and intelligent.<br> Yes, well, it could have been many light years away from us.<br> Instead it chose to turn and attack here.<br> Why? Impossible to tell, captain, until I can make a closer survey of the creature.<br> Scotty, try flushing the radioactive waste into the ventilation system.<br> - See what effect that has.<br> - Aye.<br> I'm sorry, Jim.<br> I was wrong.<br> Captain.<br> The creature's ability to throw itself out of time sync makes it possible for it to be elsewhere in the instant the phaser hits.<br> There is, therefore, no basis for your self-recrimination.<br> If you had fired on time and on target 11 years ago, it would have made no more difference than it did an hour ago.<br> Captain Garrovick would still be dead.<br> The fault was not yours, Jim.<br> In fact, there was no fault.<br> If you wanna play analyst, Spock, use someone else, not me.<br> My concern is with the ship and the crew.<br> Come in.<br> Ensign, am I correct in my assumption that you've been disturbed by what you consider to be a failure on your part? I would like you to consider that the hesitation for which you are blaming yourself is a hereditary trait of your species.<br> When suddenly faced by the unknown or imminent danger, a human will invariably experience a split second of indecision.<br> He hesitates.<br> Do I have your attention, ensign? Yes, sir.<br> I know you would prefer to wallow in a pool of emotion rather than Mr.<br> Spock, it's very kind of you to come here Kindness, Mr.<br> Garrovick, is another human emotion.<br> And I believe we have enough of that.<br> I simply would like you to accept the fact that your reaction has its basis in a physio Do you smell something? - Sir, it's coming through the vent.<br> - Get out! I'll attempt to seal it off.<br> Sir, the creature's in my cabin.<br> It's got Mr.<br> Spock.<br> On my way, Garrovick.<br> Security to 341.<br> Medical alert.<br> Scotty, reverse cabin pressure, 341.<br> Security, hold it.<br> - Tricorder.<br> - Jim, Spock may be dying.<br> If we let that thing into the ship, he'll have a lot of company.<br> I must have jammed the vent control when I hit it.<br> See if the reverse pressure has pulled it back into the ventilation system.<br> He saved my life, captain.<br> I should be lying dead in there, not him.<br> Fortunately, neither of us is dead, ensign.<br> The reverse pressure worked.<br> The vent is closed.<br> Don't misunderstand my next question.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, why aren't you dead? It's that green blood of his.<br> My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron.<br> I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth too.<br> Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct.<br> Yes.<br> The scent is different.<br> I think I understand something now.<br> Do you believe you're in communication with the creature? I don't know what it is, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But you remember I said the thing was alive.<br> It may not be communication as we understand it, but I did know it was alive and intelligent.<br> And I think I know something else now.<br> Engineering to Captain Kirk.<br> Engineering to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Scott, captain.<br> The creature's moving back toward the Number 2 lmpulse Vent.<br> The radioactive flushing may be affecting it.<br> Open the vent.<br> On my way to the Bridge.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Ensign Garrovick.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You were on the Bridge when we were attacked.<br> Yes, I'm sorry, sir.<br> I know I was confined to quarters Very commendable, ensign.<br> What was your impression of the battle? - I don't understand, sir.<br> - I'm asking for your military appraisal.<br> The techniques used against the creature.<br> Ineffective, captain.<br> I realise, captain, you did everything you could do.<br> I know that.<br> It's just nothing works against a monster that can do the things that thing does.<br> And, ensign, what is your appraisal of your conduct on the planet? - I delayed firing.<br> - And if you hadn't delayed firing? No difference, ensign.<br> No weapon known would have made any difference.<br> Then or 11 years ago.<br> Report for duty, ensign.<br> Yes, captain.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> - Report, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Results positive, captain.<br> The creature has left the ship at high warp speed and is already nearly out of scanner range.<br> The way that thing can move, captain.<br> - I wouldn't believe it.<br> - Direction, Mr.<br> Spock? It was bearing 1-2-7, mark 9, but I have lost it now.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, I'll need all the speed you can deliver.<br> Keep at it until we begin to shake apart.<br> Kirk out.<br> I believe I know where it's going.<br> It has changed course before to mislead us, captain.<br> - Logic would dictate - No, I'm playing intuition.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, compute a course for the Tycho star system.<br> - Computed and on the board, sir.<br> - Ahead full.<br> Ahead full, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet and the USS Yorktown.<br> Frequency open and clear, sir.<br> Inform them that we are pursuing the creature to Planet IV of that system.<br> That's the location of its attack on the USS Farragut 11 years ago.<br> I do not understand, captain.<br> In Garrovick's quarters, I said the scent of the creature was different.<br> Something in my mind said \"home.<br>\" And do you know where home is, captain? Yes, I think I do.<br> I don't know how I know, but home is where it fought a starship once before.<br> Give them our tactical situation.<br> Inform them I'm committing this vessel to the destruction of the creature.<br> We will rendezvous Roundtrip time, Mr.<br> Chekov? We will rendezvous with the USS Yorktown in 48 hours.<br> I assume you now believe we should pursue the creature and destroy it.<br> - Precisely.<br> - You don't agree with Mr.<br> Spock? It's the time factor that bothers me.<br> Those drugs are perishable.<br> Doctor, evidence indicates the creature is here to spawn.<br> If so, it will reproduce by fission, not just into two parts, - but thousands.<br> - Antimatter seems our only possibility.<br> An ounce should be sufficient.<br> We can drain it from the ship's engines, transport it to the planet's surface in a magnetic vacuum field.<br> Contact medical stores.<br> I want as much hemoplasm as they can spare in the Transporter Room in 15 minutes.<br> Yes, sir.<br> I presume you intend to use the hemoplasm to attract the creature.<br> We must get it to the antimatter.<br> It seems attracted to red blood cells.<br> What better bait could we have? There is still one problem, captain.<br> - The blast, yes.<br> - Exactly.<br> A matter-antimatter blast will rip away half the planet's atmosphere.<br> If our vessel is in orbit and encounters those shock waves A chance we'll have to take, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We cannot be certain the transporter will operate under those conditions.<br> If a man is beaming up when that hits, we may lose him.<br> That's exactly why I've decided to set the trap myself.<br> Captain, there is so little haemoglobin in my green blood, the creature could not harm me extensively.<br> It therefore seems logical for me to be the one Negative, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> In case this plan fails, I'll need you aboard the ship.<br> In that event, we'll need another plan.<br> It will require two men to transport the antimatter unit.<br> I'd like permission to go with you, sir.<br> I had you in mind, Mr.<br> Garrovick.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Spock here, captain.<br> Proceed immediately to maximum orbit.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Just think, captain, less than one ounce of antimatter here is more powerful than Let's hope it's as powerful as man will ever get.<br> - Detonator.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Spock here, captain.<br> Holding at 30,000 kilometres.<br> Antimatter container positioned and armed.<br> I'll call you back when it's baited.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain, look! The hemoplasm.<br> The bait's already taken.<br> We'll have to use something else for bait.<br> Sir, that thing only feeds on blood.<br> Garrovick, get back to the ship.<br> Tell them to prepare to detonate.<br> Captain, you're not gonna be the bait.<br> I said, get back to the ship.<br> - Ensign, I gave you an order.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Consider yourself on report.<br> This is no time for heroics.<br> I have no intention of sacrificing myself.<br> At least, not yet.<br> Spock? Spock? Spock here.<br> Scan us and lock onto us.<br> It's going to be close.<br> Very, very close.<br> Stand by.<br> Stand by, Enterprise.<br> I can smell it, captain.<br> It's sickly.<br> Honey-sweet.<br> Stand by, Enterprise.<br> Now! Energize and detonate! Reset.<br> Energize.<br> All decks, stand by.<br> Shock waves! - Do something.<br> - We are, doctor.<br> Cross-circuiting to A.<br> Got them.<br> A piece of them, anyway.<br> Cross-circuiting to B.<br> Crazy way to travel.<br> Spreading a man's molecules all over the universe.<br> Captain.<br> Thank heaven.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, there was no deity involved.<br> It was my cross-circuiting to B that recovered them.<br> Well, then, thank pitchforks and pointed ears.<br> As long as it worked, Jim.<br> That's a fair statement, Bones.<br> Now that the creature is dead, let's save some lives.<br> We'll deliver your medicine.<br> - Bridge, this is Kirk.<br> - Uhura here.<br> Have Mr.<br> Chekov lay a course for rendezvous with the Yorktown.<br> - Maximum warp.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Oh, ensign.<br> Meet me in my quarters when you've cleaned up.<br> I'd like to talk to you about your father.<br> Several tall stories I think you'd like to hear.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> I would.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain, I think I'm going to like Argelius.<br> Obviously a man of good taste.<br> You mean to tell me that all these women, that all this is.<br>.<br>? Yes, yes, yes.<br> The Argelians think very highly of their pleasure.<br> That's an understatement if I ever heard one.<br> This is a completely hedonistic society.<br> - Do you like her, Scotty? - Aye.<br> - Why shouldn't I? - Good.<br> I've invited her to join us at the table.<br> I thought you might like to meet her.<br> Now, that's what I call a real captain.<br> Always thinking of his men.<br> Scotty, Scotty, on Argelius they use the lights.<br> No one has to tell an old Aberdeen pub crawler how to applaud, captain.<br> Have one of our pillows? 'Tis a fine foggy night tonight, and I doubt if anyone has ever told you of the marvellous fogs we have in Aberdeen.<br> Never a word.<br> - But I'm dying to learn.<br> - Well, then, why don't I show you? There's nothing like a walk in the fog with a bonny lass.<br> Or a handsome gentleman.<br> Why don't we? You don't mind, do you? I might even get back to the ship on time.<br> We won't leave without you, Scotty.<br> Relax and enjoy yourself.<br> My work is never done.<br> My work, Jim.<br> This is prescription stuff.<br> Don't forget, the explosion that threw Scotty against the bulkhead was caused by a woman.<br> Physically, he's all right.<br> Am I right in assuming that? Oh, yes, yes.<br> Matter of fact, considerable psychological damage could have been caused.<br> For example, his total resentment toward women.<br> He seems to be overcoming his resentment.<br> In my professional opinion, when he gets back to the ship he's going to hate you for making him leave Argelius.<br> But then, he will have lost total resentment toward women.<br> Mission accomplished, as far as Scotty is concerned.<br> Bones, I know a little place across town where the women Oh, yes, I know the place.<br> I know the place.<br> Let's go.<br> - I think it's that way.<br> - I think it's that way too.<br> - She's dead, Jim.<br> - Stabbed a dozen times.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3614.<br>9.<br> Planet Argelius II.<br> While on therapeutic shore leave, Mr.<br> Scott has fallen under suspicion of having brutally murdered an Argelian woman.<br> The chief city administrator, a Mr.<br> Hengist, has taken charge of the investigation, but has learned little of value.<br> I don't know what to say, gentlemen.<br> Argelius is the last planet in the galaxy I'd expect a thing like this to happen.<br> We're just as shocked as you are, Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> If this was my home planet, Rigel IV, I'd have a dozen investigators working on the matter.<br> But they don't exist here.<br> You're not a native of Argelius, sir? No.<br> Argelius hires its administrative officers from other planets.<br> The Argelians aren't very efficient, you know.<br> Gentle, harmless people.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? Now, are you sure you've never seen this before? I don't remember.<br> Really, sir.<br> That is hardly helpful.<br> Scotty, you left the cafÃÂ© with the girl.<br> Do you remember that? What happened next? We were walking the fog I was up ahead, trying to lead the way.<br> I heard the girl scream.<br> I remember starting to turn.<br> - I don't remember another thing.<br> - Scotty, you've got to remember.<br> Jim.<br> If he says he can't remember, he probably doesn't.<br> You know Scotty.<br> I know that a murder has been committed.<br> You don't think by any chance Scotty It doesn't make any difference what I think.<br> You don't just throw him to the wolves.<br> Bones, I have a diplomatic responsibility.<br> This happened under Argelian jurisdiction.<br> If they want to arrest him, try him, even convict him, I have to go along with it.<br> But he's suffering from a severe concussion.<br> We'll do what we can.<br> It's not promising, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott insists he remembers nothing.<br> But my detector readings indicate only his fingerprints on the murder weapon.<br> Mr.<br> Hengist, there were other people in the cafÃÂ© at the time of the murder.<br> Several of them left just before Mr.<br> Scott and the girl did.<br> So I've been informed by the staff.<br> They're being located, and we will question them.<br> But the outlook for your friend is quite grim.<br> What is the law in these cases? The law of Argelius is love.<br> Gentlemen, our prefect, Jaris.<br> Sir, Captain Kirk and Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> And this is my wife, Sybo.<br> And this man is Scott, the one I sent you the message about.<br> He does not look like a man capable of such an act.<br> Still, it's been so long.<br> Gentlemen, before our great awakening 200 years ago we had ways of learning the truth in such matters.<br> We shall return to them.<br> - The Argelian empathic contact? - You know of this? Yes, we've heard of it.<br> I assumed it was a lost art.<br> My wife is a descendant of the ancient priestesses of our land.<br> She has the ancestral gift.<br> Gentlemen, I have come to invite you to my home.<br> Prefect, don't you think this should be handled in an official manner through my office? It shall be handled in an official manner, Mr.<br> Hengist, since I am the highest official.<br> Gentlemen, let's proceed to my home, where, with the aid of my wife, we shall learn the truth.<br> Please.<br> Depending on your wife's empathic abilities is all very well, prefect, but there's one way we can find out what it is Mr.<br> Scott cannot remember.<br> Since you find it impossible to let us go back up to our ship, I can beam down a technician with a psychotricorder.<br> Prefect, it will give us a detailed account of everything that's happened to Mr.<br> Scott in the last 24 hours.<br> I'd advise against it, prefect.<br> This is purely an Argelian matter.<br> My wife must meditate for a time before she is ready.<br> I see no reason why we should not use that time to good advantage.<br> - Very well, captain.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, Spock here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, beam down a technician with a psychotricorder, please.<br> Use these coordinates.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> Coordinates received.<br> - Kirk out.<br> Prefect, the psychotricorder will require privacy in order to be effective.<br> There is a small chamber below this room.<br> Perhaps that will suffice.<br> Captain news of this frightful murder is spreading among my people.<br> They're greatly disturbed.<br> I have already heard talk of closing Argelius to space vehicles.<br> Well, that would be most unfortunate.<br> Argelian hospitality is well-known, as well as its strategic importance as a space port.<br> Yes, I believe it's the only one in the quadrant.<br> Captain.<br> There are other people we should question.<br> Perhaps I should go expedite their arrival here? Please do so, Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> Anyone connected with this murder should be present at the ceremony.<br> Lieutenant Karen Tracy reporting as ordered, captain.<br> Lieutenant, I want a 24-hour regressive memory check made on Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Yes, captain.<br> Where shall I set up? If you will just follow me, lieutenant.<br> Scotty, cooperate completely with Lieutenant Tracy.<br> - Maybe we can clear this thing up.<br> - I certainly hope so, sir.<br> I can't stand this not knowing.<br> Captain, under normal conditions, Scotty would have never done such a thing.<br> But that blow on the head.<br> It could put all his previous behaviour patterns into the junk heap.<br> - Of course, there is another possibility.<br> - Explain.<br> Hysterical amnesia.<br> When a man feels guilty about something too terrible to remember he blots it out of his conscious memory.<br> - Are you ready, Sybo? - I am ready.<br> - May I have the knife, please? - Certainly.<br> Among other gifts, Sybo has the ability to receive impressions from inanimate objects.<br> Do you have it, captain? The knife? No.<br> But I put it here when we arrived.<br> It's gone.<br> Scotty.<br> She's dead, Jim.<br> Just like the other one.<br> Stabbed over and over again.<br> Drink this.<br> An Argelian stimulant, doctor.<br> Quite effective and quite harmless.<br> Go ahead, Scotty.<br> Lieutenant Captain.<br> Where's.<br>.<br>? Lieutenant Tracy is dead, Scott.<br> You were found alone in the room.<br> - Dead? But - What happened down there? I was sitting there.<br> She was taking the readings and now I'm sitting here.<br> Is that all that happened? I tell you, I don't remember.<br> I must have passed out.<br> It could be, Jim.<br> That head injury.<br> Yeah.<br> That head injury.<br> Think, Scotty.<br> Captain, I've been trying.<br> I can't even believe this is really happening.<br> There's no way into that place from up here.<br> Prefect.<br> Is there another entrance to that chamber? Yes, there's a door that leads into the garden.<br> But that's been locked for years.<br> - Locks can be picked, Jim.<br> - Check it.<br> Prefect, both of these men were at the cafÃÂ© the night of the murder.<br> Where have they been the past few minutes? - Captain, if you don't mind, please - There's been another murder.<br> - One of my crew.<br> - The same as Kara.<br> Why, that's terrible.<br> You.<br> My men picked you up near here.<br> What were you doing? Please.<br> I know nothing about it.<br> I didn't kill anyone.<br> - How was the girl killed? - Stabbed.<br> And there's no sign of the weapon.<br> - If only I had facility - You.<br> You were a musician at the cafÃÂ©.<br> You played for the murdered girl.<br> Since she was a little girl, she danced for me.<br> She was my daughter.<br> Prefect, how could a thing like this have happened here? The man who did it must be found.<br> He must be punished.<br> And you.<br> You left the cafÃÂ© before Scott and Kara.<br> Is this true? Who are you? Morla of Cantaba Street, prefect.<br> I was there.<br> I have nothing to hide.<br> Did you know Kara? Of course he knew her.<br> They were to be married.<br> But he behaved disgraceful, unheard of.<br> He was jealous of her.<br> - That is very disquieting.<br> - I know it was wrong, prefect, but I just couldn't help myself.<br> I loved her and when she went over to the table with these men, I just could not stand to watch, so I left.<br> I went home.<br> Jealousy has often been a motive for murder.<br> Yes, I know.<br> That is why the emotion is so strongly disapproved of here.<br> Prefect, I didn't kill anyone.<br> I couldn't.<br> We shall see, Morla.<br> Sorry, Jim.<br> The lock may or may not have been picked.<br> Be hard to tell, even with the tricorder.<br> Can you prove you went directly home? Captain, may I continue with the questions, please? Well, get on with it, man, just don't stand there.<br> Captain, you are behaving very much like a man who is desperately trying anything to save his friend.<br> Would you be as desperate to save Argelius as a space port for your Starfleet? Well, of course I'm trying to save my friend if he's innocent.<br> And he hasn't been proven guilty.<br> Need I remind you of the circumstances, captain? In both cases, your friend Scott was discovered over the body, and later claimed to remember nothing.<br> I am ready, Jaris.<br> Gentlemen, sit down, please.<br> On one condition, prefect: That the room be sealed so that no one can leave or enter while the ceremony is going on.<br> The room is sealed.<br> Captain, do you mean my neck is going to depend on some spooky mumbo-jumbo? - Kirk here.<br> - Spock here, captain.<br> - May I have a word with you? - Yes.<br> Excuse me, gentlemen.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Concerning the situation you related to us, in my opinion, the Argelian empathic contact is an interesting phenomenon.<br> But the technique is not sound enough to risk a man's life.<br> What do you suggest, Mr.<br> Spock? Simply that we beam Mr.<br> Scott onboard the Enterprise and employ our computers to learn the truth.<br> These are a proud people.<br> They have their own customs, their own laws.<br> And while we're here, we're subject to them.<br> It is absolutely imperative that this matter be resolved according to Argelian law.<br> Is that clear? Quite clear, captain.<br> I don't like it any more than you do, but there's nothing we can do about it.<br> Kirk out.<br> Let us begin.<br> Let the circle not be broken.<br> Concentrate upon the flame which burns upon the Altar of Truth.<br> Yes.<br> There is something here.<br> Something terrible.<br> I feel its presence.<br> Fear, anger, hatred.<br> Anger feeds the flame.<br> There is evil here, monstrous, terrible evil.<br> Consuming hunger.<br> Hatred of all that lives, hatred of women.<br> A hunger that never dies.<br> It is strong, overpowering.<br> An ancient terror.<br> It has a name.<br> Beratis, Kesla, Redjac.<br> Devouring all life, all light.<br> A hunger that will never die! Redjac! Redjac! Three murders, and Scotty the only possible answer each time.<br> I don't care what the circumstances indicate, Jim.<br> - Scotty simply could not have done it.<br> - Normally, no.<br> - But that blow on his head could - No, captain.<br> Scotty, I'm sorry.<br> You don't even remember whether you did it or not.<br> I agree with you, captain.<br> I am perfectly satisfied Mr.<br> Scott is guilty.<br> - But not responsible.<br> - That is unproven.<br> - We can prove it.<br> If he's insane.<br> - Gentlemen, please.<br> How could any man do such monstrous things? That's what we hope to find out, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? Sir, I swear to you, I did not kill your wife or the other ladies.<br> By your own admission, you don't know whether you did or didn't.<br> - Your so-called failing memory - Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> On the Enterprise we can make a recording of the registrations of Mr.<br> Scott's conscious and subconscious mind.<br> And they will tell us what happened to him in the recent past.<br> There would be no room for doubt.<br> We would know.<br> And after all, that's what we're after, isn't it, prefect? To know? You, sir, claim to remember nothing about the murders.<br> Aye.<br> If this is so, you may have killed without knowing it.<br> Will your machines tell us this? No doubt will remain.<br> Very well.<br> We will go to your ship.<br> And he who is guilty will face the ancient penalties, barbaric and horrible though they may be.<br> The ancient penalty for murder was death by slow torture.<br> That law has never been changed.<br> Do you understand that, Mr.<br> Scott? Aye, I understand.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3615.<br>4.<br> With Mr.<br> Scott in a technical state of arrest, we've beamed aboard the Enterprise to continue the investigation.<br> Each testifier will sit here, place his hand on this plate.<br> Any deviation from the factual truth will be immediately detected and relayed to this computer, which will, in turn, notify us.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has already fed the computer his medical reports.<br> Our laboratory experts are examining the murder weapon and will give their data to the computers for analysis.<br> Shall we begin? Mr.<br> Scott, will you take the stand? Computer, identity verification.<br> Working.<br> Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott.<br> Serial number: SE 19754T.<br> Verified.<br> Subject's present physical condition? Working.<br> Subject recently received severe blow on skull.<br> Damage healing.<br> Some peripheral abnormalities.<br> Sufficient abnormalities to account for periods of functional amnesia? Working.<br> Negative.<br> Captain, I don't see how that can be.<br> Unless Scotty's lying about his loss of memory.<br> I'm not lying, captain.<br> I don't remember a thing about the first two murders.<br> Computer, accuracy scan.<br> Subject relaying accurate account.<br> No physiological changes.<br> Captain I didn't black out when Mr.<br> Jaris' wife was killed.<br> All right, Scotty.<br> Let's have it.<br> We were holding hands.<br> When the lights went out, the circle was broken.<br> I heard the poor lady scream and, as I was near the head of the table anyway, I went toward her, but there was something in my way.<br> Something? You mean, someone.<br> No, captain.<br> Something.<br> Cold it was, like a stinking draught out of a slaughterhouse.<br> But it wasn't really there.<br> Like If you know what I mean.<br> Computer? Subject relaying accurate account.<br> No physiological changes.<br> All right.<br> Let's hit it on the head.<br> Scotty, did you kill Sybo? No, captain.<br> That I'm sure of.<br> He's been saying that right along.<br> Means no more now than it did before.<br> Scotty, lie to me.<br> How old are you? Twenty-two, sir.<br> Inaccurate, inaccurate.<br> Data in error.<br> After the lights went out, Mr.<br> Scott, who was holding your hand? Morla on the one side, and you on the other, sir.<br> But that doesn't mean anything, captain, with a room that small.<br> The lights were out.<br> Anyone would have had time to kill the lady.<br> But I remind you, we found Mr.<br> Scott holding her in his arms.<br> The knife I'm sorry, sir, but I must.<br> The knife still in her back, and blood on his hands.<br> The verifier showed that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't kill her.<br> There were two other women murdered.<br> Mr.<br> Scott did you kill Kara? - I don't remember.<br> - Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? - I don't remember.<br> Computer, accuracy scan.<br> Subject relaying accurate account.<br> No physiological changes.<br> All that proves is that he's telling the truth - when he says he doesn't remember.<br> - This is a waste of time.<br> After we take the testimony here, we'll run a psychotricorder analysis of Mr.<br> Scott's memory, which is what we wanted to do on the surface.<br> That will give us a complete record.<br> Will that satisfy you, Mr.<br> Hengist? Well If you can convince me that the machine is incapable of error and if it shows he didn't kill the women.<br> There will be no error.<br> As for the rest of it, the readings will show.<br> I think you can step down now, Mr.<br> Scott, if there are no objections.<br> I object to the entire procedure.<br> Mr.<br> Hengist, we are here on my authority.<br> We will cooperate.<br> Prefect, I know you mean well, but I've had experience For the time being, we will accept Captain Kirk's explanation of the machine's accuracy as factual.<br> I do, however, reserve to myself the right to make the final determination.<br> We can ask no more.<br> Mr.<br> Morla, will you take the stand? Where were you at the time that Kara was murdered? I'm not sure.<br> Walking home, I assume.<br> I was angry.<br> Anger is a relative state, sir.<br> Were you angry enough to do violence? I've never done violence in my life.<br> I don't think that I could.<br> You've got to believe me.<br> I wouldn't kill her.<br> I couldn't.<br> I loved her, and she loved me.<br> That's not true.<br> He might think she loved him, but she didn't.<br> She told me.<br> He was jealous all the time.<br> They fought constantly.<br> - Did you kill Lieutenant Tracy? - No.<br> - Did you kill Sybo? - No.<br> Computer, verification scan.<br> Subject relaying accurate account, though some statements subjective.<br> No physiological changes.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Morla.<br> I think you can step down now.<br> Sybo spoke of a hunger that never dies.<br> Something that thrives on fear, terror, death.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, maybe we're going about it the wrong way.<br> Let's assume that Sybo was a sensitive, that she did sense something, something evil.<br> The sensitivity of certain Argelian women is a documented fact, captain.<br> My poor Sybo's talent was genuine, gentlemen.<br> - What she told you was true.<br> - All right, then.<br> What was it she said, exactly? Monstrous evil, ancient terror That devours all life and light.<br> She said something else, words that didn't make any sense.<br> Yes.<br> Redjac, Beratis and Kesla.<br> - Obscure, meaningless words.<br> - To us, perhaps, - but to the computer - Mr.<br> Spock, check them out.<br> Computer, linguistic bank.<br> Definition of following word: Redjac.<br> Working.<br> Negative finding.<br> There is no such word in the linguistics bank? Affirmative.<br> - Scan all other banks.<br> - Working.<br> Affirmative.<br> - A proper name.<br> - Define.<br> Redjac.<br> Source: Earth, 19th century.<br> Language: English.<br> Nickname for mass murderer of women.<br> Other Earth synonym: Jack the Ripper.<br> Jack the Ripper? Well, that's ridiculous.<br> He lived hundreds of years ago.<br> A man couldn't survive all these centuries.<br> Just before she died my wife said, \"It is a hunger that never dies.<br>\" - But all men die.<br> - Yes, all men die.<br> And Jack the Ripper couldn't be alive if he were a man.<br> But everything we've uncovered points to Jack the Ripper, which is an impossibility, isn't it? Or is it? Humans and humanoids make up only a small percentage of the life forms we know of.<br> There are entities possessed of extremely long life spans, virtually immortal.<br> We know that someone or something killed three women.<br> If it's impossible for it to be human, it has to be something else.<br> - Something driven to kill.<br> - But Sybo said that it feeds on death.<br> In the strict scientific sense, doctor, we all feed on death.<br> Even vegetarians.<br> Yes, but it said more than that.<br> Not just death, but fear.<br> Said it also feeds on fear.<br> Which would tend to support the proposition that the murderer was not human.<br> Deriving sustenance from emotion is not unknown in the galaxy, and fear is among the strongest and most violent of the emotions.<br> Surely, prefect, this has gone far enough.<br> Someone, some man, has killed three women.<br> We have the prime suspect in our hands.<br> Are we going to let him go and start chasing ghosts? No, Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> Not ghosts.<br> Possibly not human, but not ghosts.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, check out the possibilities.<br> Computer, digest log recordings for past five solar minutes.<br> Correlate hypotheses.<br> Compare with life forms registered.<br> Question: Could such an entity, within discussed limits, exist in this galaxy? The Drella of Alpha Carinae V derives nourishment from the emotion of love.<br> There is sufficient precedent for existence of creature, nature unknown, which could exist on emotion of fear.<br> Computer, extrapolate most likely composition of such entity.<br> Working.<br> To meet with specified requirements, entity would exist without form in conventional sense.<br> Most probable, mass of energy.<br> A highly cohesive electromagnetic field.<br> Computer could the described entity assume physical form? Affirmative.<br> Precedent: Mellitus, cloud creature of Alpha Majoris I.<br> - Fairy tales.<br> Ghosts and goblins.<br> - No.<br> I've seen the Mellitus myself.<br> In its natural state, it's gaseous.<br> When it's at rest, it's solid.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, let's assume the existence of this creature.<br> I point out that Jack the Ripper slew at will in the heart of the most populous city of old Earth, and was never identified.<br> Doesn't seem likely, does it? I suggest the possibility of a hypnotic screen, which blinds all but the victim to the presence of the killer.<br> - Is that possible? - Extremely possible.<br> There are many such examples that exist in nature.<br> Well, this is fantasy.<br> We all know the murderer is sitting right here with us, but you're trying to cloud the issue.<br> I've got a mind to I am satisfied the course of this investigation is valid enough.<br> Please be seated, Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> What do we have? A creature without form that feeds on horror and fear, that must assume a physical shape to kill.<br> And, I suspect, preys on women, because women are more easily and more deeply terrified, generating more sheer horror than the male of the species.<br> Computer, criminological files.<br> Cases of unsolved mass murders of women since Jack the Ripper.<br> Working.<br> Seven women knifed to death.<br> Five women knifed to death.<br> Eight women knifed to death.<br> Ten women knifed to death.<br> There are additional examples.<br> Captain, those places are aligned directly between Argelius and Earth.<br> Yes.<br> When man moved out into the galaxy, that thing must have moved with him.<br> Computer.<br> Identify the proper names Kesla and Beratis.<br> Working.<br> Kesla: Name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet Deneb II.<br> Beratis: Name given to unidentified mass murderer of women on planet Rigel IV.<br> Additional data: Murders on Rigel IV occurred one solar year ago.<br> You come from Rigel IV.<br> Well, many people do.<br> It's not a crime.<br> No, but what we're investigating is.<br> Would you mind taking the stand, Mr.<br> Hengist? - I will not.<br> - Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> Prefect, this has gone far enough.<br> I will not take the stand.<br> I can appreciate your position, sir.<br> You are in charge of civil disturbances locally.<br> If you are the entity for which we search, what better position from which to kill with impunity.<br> And just after you left Jaris' house, we discovered the murder knife was missing.<br> And you were unaccounted for when Lieutenant Tracy was murdered.<br> An entity which feeds on fear and terror would find a perfect hunting ground on Argelius, a planet without violence, where the inhabitants are as peaceful as sheep.<br> The entity would be as a hungry wolf in that fold.<br> Gentlemen, I know something of the law.<br> You're engaging in sheer speculation.<br> Perhaps.<br> Mr.<br> Spock the murder weapon.<br> Computer, report on analysis of exhibit A.<br> Working.<br> Exhibit A on visual.<br> Composition of blade: Boridium.<br> Composition of handle: Murinite.<br> Details of carving on handle conform to folk-art forms indicating place of origin.<br> Specify point of origin.<br> Artefact produced by hill people of Argus River region, planet Rigel IV.<br> Now, then, Mr.<br> Hengist.<br> - He's dead, Jim.<br> - But that's impossible.<br> Redjac.<br> Redjac.<br> Redjac! The computer will not respond to these controls.<br> The entity is unquestionably controlling it.<br> And the computer controls the ship.<br> Redjac.<br> Redjac.<br> Redjac! Scotty, give me a hand.<br> No use, captain.<br> The bypass circuits are blocked.<br> Audio cut-off, Spock.<br> Captain.<br> - What's happening, captain? - What does it mean? It means that thing can control the entire operation of the ship, including the life-support systems.<br> You mean it could kill us all? Indeed, it will try, but not immediately.<br> We know it feeds on fear and terror.<br> There are nearly 440 humans aboard this ship.<br> Surely it will try to breed fear and terror before it kills.<br> All hands, this is the captain.<br> Stay at your posts.<br> Remain calm.<br> Captain out.<br> Bones, what's the sedative situation? I've got some stuff that would tranquilize an active volcano.<br> Good.<br> Start distribution immediately.<br> The longer we can hold back that fear, the more time we'll have to get that thing out of the computer.<br> Prefect, you'll all be safer here.<br> Spock, come with me.<br> Don't you have a compulsory scan unit built into the computer banks? Yes, we do, but with the entity in control Aren't there certain mathematical problems - which simply cannot be solved? - Indeed.<br> If we could focus the attention of the computer on one of them That ought to do it.<br> Spock.<br> Apparently, our friend's learned very quickly.<br> Too quickly.<br> Bridge.<br> - Free fall.<br> - Out of control.<br> Put it on manual.<br> Bridge.<br> That was due to be next.<br> Life-support malfunction.<br> - We don't have much time, captain.<br> - You said it yourself, Spock.<br> It wants terror.<br> Not just death.<br> Captain, the life-support-system override jammed.<br> - All right, man your station, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Captain, you are wasting your time.<br> Cut that thing off.<br> You and all aboard your ship are about to die! Try and cut that thing off.<br> This is the first time I heard a malfunction threaten us.<br> Man your post, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Prepare your manual overrides.<br> You may need them.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Spock.<br> Normal environmental levels have been restored, captain, but it will not last long.<br> A few hours at best.<br> That should be enough time.<br> Let's get at it.<br> - What's going on, captain? - Never mind, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Tranquilizer? - Yes, sir.<br> - Everyone, including yourself.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> You cannot stop me now, captain.<br> It will do you no good.<br> I control all circuits.<br> You cannot silence me.<br> You cannot reach me.<br> Your manual overrides are extremely limited in life.<br> Spock? Proceeding, captain, but I will need some time.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Soon, all control will be restored to me.<br> There is nothing you can do to prevent it.<br> If you destroy this ship, you destroy yourself.<br> I am without ending.<br> I have existed from the dawn of time, and I shall live beyond its end.<br> I shall feed, and this time I do not need a knife.<br> You will all die horribly in searing pain.<br> It is attempting to generate terror, captain.<br> I may cut off your oxygen and suffocate you.<br> Captain.<br> Whoever he is, he sure talks gloomy.<br> Man your post, Sulu.<br> If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override.<br> And above all, don't be afraid.<br> With an arm full of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova.<br> - Ready.<br> - Implement.<br> Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive.<br> Compute to the last digit the value of pi.<br> No, no! No! As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution.<br> The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else, until we order it to stop.<br> Yes, that should keep that thing busy for a while.<br> The Argelians will be the first to panic.<br> Let's get back to the Briefing Room.<br> I wonder who it is we're not supposed to be afraid of.<br> Well, sir? I doubt very much whether the computers will be inhabited by more than a group of figures for a while.<br> There is resistance, captain, but the directive is succeeding.<br> Bank after bank is turning to the problem.<br> If you drive it from the computers, it'll go somewhere else.<br> How are you doing? I'm almost finished.<br> Just Jaris and me.<br> Complete computer control, captain.<br> The entity has fled.<br> Yes, but where to? Bones, what would happen if that thing entered a tranquilized body? It might take up knitting, nothing more violent than that.<br> And you say everyone's had a shot but you and Jaris? And you and Mr.<br> Spock, captain.<br> Well, I'm willing to take a chance on Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Better give yourself a shot, doctor.<br> - No, I think I want to stay clear.<br> Do as I say.<br> Extend your arm, Mr.<br> Jaris.<br> No! Kill you all.<br> Die! Make you suffer! Everybody, keep back.<br> I'll kill her.<br> I'll kill her.<br> Keep back.<br> Be careful.<br> You're going to hurt somebody with that thing.<br> You'll suffer, you Kill all.<br> Let's get him to the Transporter Room, quick.<br> Die, die, die, everybody.<br> Die.<br> Kill, kill, kill you all.<br> Deep space, full power.<br> Widest angle of dispersion.<br> Maintain.<br> Don't get excited, captain.<br> I'll do it.<br> You do it, Spock.<br> Everybody, die.<br> You didn't have to shove me, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'd have gotten round to it.<br> Well, Jaris is all right.<br> What did you do with that thing, send it back to the planet? No, we beamed it out into open space, Scotty, - widest possible dispersion.<br> - The thing can't die.<br> Possibly, doctor.<br> It's consciousness may continue for some time, consisting of billions of separate bits of energy, floating forever in space, powerless.<br> But it will die, finally.<br> You seem very happy about the whole thing.<br> And why not? For a while there, I didn't know whether I was innocent or guilty.<br> Bones, how long will it take for this tranquilizer to wear off? Oh, I don't know, five or six hours.<br> I gave them all a pretty big shot, Jim.<br> Yes, I can see that.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, for the next five or six hours we're gonna have the happiest crew in space.<br> Of course, we won't get much work done.<br> Captain, since you came to Argelius to rest, I suggest you take advantage of the opportunity.<br> That's a splendid idea, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I know a cafÃÂ© where the women are so - I know the place, Jim.<br> - Let's go see.<br> You gentlemen, in your condition? Don't be ridiculous.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, this cafÃÂ© has women that are so No, I guess not.<br> Alone? Gentlemen.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

One parsec, sir.<br> Close enough to smell them.<br> That is illogical, ensign.<br> Odours cannot travel through the vacuum of space.<br> - I was making a little joke, sir.<br> - Extremely little, ensign.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, immediate past history of the quadrant.<br> Under dispute between the two parties since initial contact.<br> The battle of Donatu V was fought near here Inconclusive.<br> - Analysis of disputed area.<br> - Undeveloped.<br> Sherman's Planet is claimed by both sides, our Federation and the Klingon Empire.<br> We do have the better claim.<br> The area was first mapped by the famous Russian astronomer, lvan Burkoff, almost 200 - John Burke.<br> - Burke, sir? I don't think so.<br> I'm sure it was John Burke was the chief astronomer at the Royal Academy in Old Britain at the time.<br> Royal Academy, oh, well.<br> Is the rest of your history that faulty, ensign? Key points of dispute.<br> Under the terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, one side or the other must prove it can develop the planet most efficiently.<br> And unfortunately, though the Klingons are brutal and aggressive, they are most efficient.<br> I remember once Peter the Great had a problem like that.<br> He - Captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Captain, I'm picking up a subspace distress call, priority channel.<br> - It's from Space Station K-7.<br> - Go to warp factor 6.<br> Code 1 emergency, that's a disaster call.<br> This is a red alert.<br> Man your battle stations.<br> All hands.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4523.<br>3.<br> Deep Space Station K-7 has issued a priority- 1 call.<br> More than an emergency, it signals near or total disaster.<br> We can only assume the Klingons have attacked the station.<br> We're going in, armed for battle.<br> Main phasers armed and ready, sir.<br> But there's nothing there.<br> Just the station.<br> Priority-1 distress call.<br> It's just absolutely peaceful.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, break subspace silence.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Channel's open, sir.<br> Space Station K-7, this is Captain Kirk of the Enterprise.<br> What is your emergency? Captain Kirk, this is Mr.<br> Lurry, manager of K-7.<br> I must apologise for the distress call.<br> Mr.<br> Lurry, you issued a priority-1 distress call.<br> State the nature of your emergency.<br> Well, perhaps you better beam over.<br> I'll try to explain.<br> You'll try to explain? You'd better be prepared to do more than that.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I'll need your help.<br> Chekov, maintain battle readiness.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, see that the Transporter Room is standing by.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Transporter Room, stand by.<br> Mr.<br> Lurry, if there was no emergency, why did you issue a priority-1 distress call? That was my order, captain.<br> Captain Kirk, this is Nilz Baris.<br> He's out from Earth to take charge of the development for Sherman's Planet.<br> And that gives you the authority to put an entire quadrant on defence alert? Mr.<br> Baris is the Federation undersecretary in charge of agricultural affairs in this quadrant.<br> And that gives him the authority.<br> This is my assistant, Arne Darvin.<br> - And this is my first officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> And now, captain, I want all available security guards.<br> I want them posted around the storage compartments.<br> Storage compartments? Storage compartments? The storage compartments containing the quadrotriticale.<br> The what? The what? What's quadrotriticale? Here.<br> Wheat.<br> So what? Quadrotriticale is not wheat, captain.<br> Of course, I wouldn't expect you or Mr.<br> Spock to know about such things, but quadrotriticale is a rather Quadrotriticale is a high-yield grain, a four-lobed hybrid of wheat and rye.<br> A perennial, also, if I'm not mistaken.<br> Its root grain, triticale, can trace its ancestry all the way back to 20th-century Canada, where Mr.<br> Spock, you've made your point.<br> Quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that will grow on Sherman's Planet.<br> Now, we have several tons of it here on the station and it's very important that that grain get to Sherman's Planet safely.<br> Mr.<br> Baris thinks that Klingon agents may try to sabotage it.<br> You issued a priority-1 distress call for a couple of tons of wheat? Quadrotriticale.<br> Of course, captain, I realise that we Mr.<br> Baris, you summoned the Enterprise without an emergency.<br> - You'll take full responsibility for it.<br> - What do you mean? Misuse of the priority-1 channel is a Federation offence.<br> I did not misuse the priority-1 channel.<br> I want that grain protected.<br> Captain, couldn't you at least post a couple of guards? We do have a large number of ships passing through.<br> It would seem a logical precaution, captain.<br> The Sherman's Planet affair is of extreme importance to the Federation.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise here.<br> Secure from general quarters and beam down two, and only two, security guards.<br> Have them report to Mr.<br> Lurry.<br> Authorise shore leave for all off-duty personnel.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> - Kirk out.<br> Captain Kirk, how dare you authorise a mere two men for a project of this importance!

She wants to shop, and I thought I would help her.<br> Excuse me.<br> Excuse me.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, what do you make of this? Oh, quadrotriticale.<br> I've read about this, but I've never seen any before.<br> Does everybody know about this wheat but me? Well, not everyone, captain.<br> It's a Russian invention.<br> I don't want any, I told you before, and I'm telling you again.<br> I don't want any more Spican flame gems.<br> Thanks to you, I already have enough Spican flame gems - to last me a lifetime.<br> - How sad for you, my friend.<br> You won't find a finer stone anywhere.<br> But I have something better.<br> Surely you want some Antarian glow water.<br> - I use that to polish the flame gems.<br> - You're a difficult man to reach.<br> But I have something from the far reaches of the galaxy.<br> - Surely you want - Not at your price.<br> Oh, what is it? Is it alive? May I hold it? Oh, it's adorable.<br> What is it? What is it? Why, lovely lady, it's a tribble.<br> A tribble? Only the sweetest creature known to man.<br> Excepting, of course, your lovely self.<br> Oh, it's purring.<br> Listen, it's purring.<br> It's only saying that it likes you.<br> Are you selling them? That's what we're trying to decide right now.<br> My friend, 10 credits apiece is a very reasonable price.<br> Now, you can see for yourself how much the lovely little lady appreciates the finer things.<br> - One credit apiece.<br> - He won't bite, will he? Sir, transporting harmful animals from one planet to another is against regulations, or weren't you aware of that? Besides, tribbles have no teeth.<br> All right, I'll double my offer.<br> Two credits.<br> Twice nothing is still nothing.<br> Well, if you're not gonna take him, I'm gonna take him.<br> I think he's cute.<br> - Four credits.<br> - Is that an offer or a joke? - That's my offer.<br> - That's a joke.<br> Five.<br> I can see you're an honest man.<br> I'll tell you what I'm going to do.<br> I'm going to lessen my price to 8 and a half credits.<br> You're talking yourself out of a deal, friend.<br> - Six credits, not a credit more.<br> - Seven and a half.<br> Seven? All right, you robber, 6 credits.<br> - Done.<br> When can I have them? - Right away.<br> All right, what are you selling them for? Well, let me see, little lady.<br> It's 6 credits.<br> I figure a reasonable mark-up for a reasonable profit, say, a 10 percent mark-up.<br> Ten credits.<br> - Thief.<br> - In fact, I'll sell you this one.<br> Hey! He's eating my grain.<br> That'll be 10 credits.<br> That happens to be my sample, and I'll do with it as I please.<br> And I please to give it to the lovely little lady here.<br> - Oh, I couldn't, could I? - I insist.<br> What are you trying to do, ruin the market? Once this lovely little lady starts to show this precious little darling around, you won't be able to keep up with them.<br> Yes, what is it?

A hundred kilometres off K-7.<br> It's just sitting there.<br> - Captain, I have Mr.<br> Lurry.<br> - Put him on visual.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Lurry, there's a Klingon warship hanging 100 kilometres off your station.<br> I don't think the Klingons are planning to attack us.<br> Why not? Because at this moment, the captain of the Klingon ship is sitting right here in my office.<br> Cancel red alert.<br> We'll beam right down.<br> Security, cancel red alert.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4524.<br>2.<br> A Klingon warship is hovering only 100 kilometres from Deep Space Station K-7 while its captain waits in the station manager's office.<br> Their intentions are unknown.<br> - My dear Captain Kirk.<br> - My dear Captain Koloth.<br> Let me assure you that my intentions are peaceful.<br> As I've already told Mr.<br> Lurry, the purpose of my presence here is to invoke shore-leave rights.<br> Shore leave? Captain, we Klingons are not as luxury-minded as you Earthers.<br> We do not equip our ships with, how shall I say it? Non-essentials.<br> We have been in space for five months and what we choose as recreation is our own business.<br> I might also add that under the terms of the Organian Peace Treaty, you cannot refuse us.<br> Yes, well, I don't make those decisions.<br> Mr.<br> Lurry is in charge of those matters.<br> Captain, may I speak to you a minute? Kirk, I don't want them here, but I don't have the authority to refuse.<br> Well, I have the authority to act, and I'm gonna use it.<br> My dear Captain Koloth, you may indeed bring your men down on shore leave.<br> But only 12 at a time, and I assure you that for every man you bring down here, I shall have one security guard.<br> There'll be no trouble.<br> Captain Kirk, there's been no formal declaration of hostilities between our two respective governments.<br> So naturally, our relationship will be a peaceful one.<br> Let us both take steps to keep it that way.<br> Of course.<br> - Another technical journal, Scotty? - Aye.<br> - Don't you ever relax? - I am relaxing.<br> How long have you had that thing, lieutenant? Since yesterday, doctor.<br> This morning I found out that he I mean, she had had babies.<br> Well, I'd say in that case you got a bargain.<br> - You running a nursery, lieutenant? - Oh, captain.<br> Well, I hadn't intended to, sir, but the tribble had other plans.<br> - Did you get this at the space station? - Yes, sir.<br> A most curious creature, captain.<br> Its trilling seems to have a tranquilizing effect on the human nervous system.<br> Fortunately, of course, I am immune to its effect.<br> Do you mind if I take one of these to the lab to see what makes it tick? Well, all right, doctor, but if you're gonna dissect it, I don't want to know about it.<br> I won't harm a hair on its head, wherever that is.<br> Say, lieutenant, seeing as you're giving them away, can I have one? Sure, why not? I think they're old enough.<br> Go ahead.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Mr.<br> Baris is waiting on channel A to speak to you, sir.<br> Pipe it down here, will you, Mr.<br> Chekov? Aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Baris is coming on.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Baris, what can I do for you? Kirk, this station is swarming with Klingons.<br> I was not aware, Mr.<br> Baris, that 12 Klingons constitutes a swarm.<br> Captain Kirk, there are Klingon soldiers on this station.<br> Now, I want you to keep that grain safe.<br> Mr.<br> Baris, I have guards around the grain, I have guards around the Klingons.<br> The only reason those guards are there is because Starfleet wants them there.<br> As for what you want it has been noted and logged.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain, may I ask where you'll be? Sickbay, with a headache.<br> Hi, Jim.<br> Bones, what have you got for a headache? Let me guess, the Klingons.<br> Baris.<br> Both.<br> Hey, how many of these did Uhura give you? - Just one.<br> - But you've got 11.<br> You noticed that, huh? Here, this ought to take care of it.<br> How do they? How do they? I haven't figured that out yet.<br> But I can tell you this much.<br> Almost 50 percent of the creature's metabolism is geared for reproduction.<br> Do you know what you get if you feed a tribble too much? A fat tribble.<br> No, you get a whole bunch of hungry little tribbles.<br> Well, Bones, all I can suggest is you open up a maternity ward.<br> I want all you men who are going on shore leave to stay in groups.<br> - Avoid trouble with the Klingons.<br> - I'll tell them before they go, sir.<br> Aren't you going on shore leave, Scotty? - Oh, no, sir.<br> - I want you to go on shore leave.<br> Make sure that everybody stays out of trouble.<br> But, captain Aye, sir.<br> Scotty, enjoy yourself.<br> Friend, can I offer you a charming little tribble? - No, thanks.<br> - Perhaps one of you other gents? Friend Klingon! Can I interest you in a harmless little tribble? Get it away from me.<br> I'm sorry, I can't understand it.<br> I've never seen them act this way before.<br> Get out of here with that parasite.<br> - He's only a harmless little - Take it away! Yes.<br> My good friend! How would you like to enter another little transaction? - This time, a tribble for a spot of - A tribble? Tribble? Tribble.<br> When are you going to get off that milk diet, lad? This is vodka.<br> Where I come from, that's soda pop.<br> Now, this is a drink for a man.<br> - Scotch? - Aye.<br> It was invented by a little old lady from Leningrad.<br> The Earthers like those fuzzy things, don't they? Why, yes.<br> Well, frankly, I never liked Earthers.<br> They remind me of Regulan blood worms.<br> - That does it.<br> - Easy, lad.<br> You ought to be more forgiving.<br> I just remembered.<br> There is one Earth man who doesn't remind me of a Regulan blood worm.<br> That's Kirk.<br> A Regulan blood worm is soft and shapeless.<br> But Kirk isn't soft.<br> Kirk may be a swaggering, overbearing, tin-plated dictator with delusions of godhood but he's not soft.<br> Take it easy, lad.<br> Everybody's entitled to an opinion.<br> That's right.<br> And if I think that Kirk is a Denebian slime devil, well, that's my opinion too.<br> Don't do it, mister, and that's an order.<br> But you heard what he called the captain.<br> Forget it.<br> It's not worth fighting for.<br> We're big enough to take a few insults.<br> Now drink your drink.<br> Of course, I'd say that Captain Kirk deserves his ship.<br> We like the Enterprise.<br> We really do.<br> That sagging old rust bucket is designed like a garbage scow.<br> Half the quadrant knows it.<br> That's why they're learning to speak Klingonee! Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Laddie, don't you think you should rephrase that? You're right, I should.<br> I didn't mean to say that the Enterprise should be hauling garbage.<br> I meant to say that it should be hauled away as garbage.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4525.<br>6.<br> A small disturbance between the Klingon crew and members of the Enterprise crew has broken out aboard Space Station K-7.<br> I am forced to cancel shore leave for both ships.<br> I want to know who started it.<br> I'm waiting.<br> Freeman, who started the fight? - I don't know, sir.<br> - All right.<br> Chekov.<br> I know you.<br> You started it, didn't you? - No, sir, I didn't.<br> - Well, who did? - I don't know, sir.<br> - \"I don't know, sir.<br>\" I want to know who threw the first punch.<br> You're all confined to quarters until I find out who started it.<br> Dismissed.<br> Scotty, not you.<br> You were supposed to prevent trouble, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, captain.<br> Who threw the first punch, Scotty? Scotty? - I did, captain.<br> - You did, Mr.<br> Scott? - What caused it, Scotty? - They insulted us, sir.<br> - Must have been some insult.<br> - Aye, it was.<br> - You threw the first punch.<br> - Aye.<br> Chekov wanted to, but I held him back.<br> You held.<br>.<br>? Why did Chekov want to start a fight? Well, the Klingons Is this off the record? No, this is not off the record.<br> Well, captain, Klingons called you a tin-plated, overbearing, swaggering dictator - with delusions of godhood.<br> - Is that all? No, sir, they also compared you with a Denebian slime devil.<br> - I see.<br> - And then they said that - I get the picture, Scotty.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> And after they said all this, that's when you hit the Klingons? - No, sir.<br> - No? No, I didn't.<br> You told us to avoid trouble.<br> Oh, yes.<br> And I didn't see that it was worth fighting about.<br> After all, we're big enough to take a few insults.<br> Aren't we? What was it they said that started the fight? They called the Enterprise a garbage scow! Sir.<br> I see.<br> And that's when you hit the Klingon.<br> Yes, sir.<br> You hit the Klingons because they insulted the Enterprise, not because they? Well, sir, this was a matter of pride.<br> All right, Scotty.<br> Dismissed.<br> Scotty, you're restricted to quarters until further notice.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> That'll give me a chance to catch up on my technical journals.<br> What's the matter, Spock? There's something disquieting about these creatures.<br> - Don't tell me you've got a feeling.<br> - Don't be insulting, doctor.<br> They remind me of the lilies of the field.<br> \"They toil not, neither do they spin.<br>\" But they seem to eat a great deal.<br> I see no practical use for them.<br> Does everything have to have a practical use for you? They're nice, they're soft, and they're furry, and they make a pleasant sound.<br> So would an ermine violin, doctor, but I see no advantage in having one.<br> It is a human characteristic to love little animals, especially if they're attractive in some way.<br> Doctor, I am well aware of human characteristics, I am frequently inundated by them, but I have trained myself to put up with practically anything.<br> Spock, I don't know too much about these little tribbles yet but there is one thing that I have discovered.<br> - What is that, doctor? - I like them.<br> Better than I like you.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Yes? They do, indeed, have one redeeming characteristic.<br> - What's that? - They do not talk too much.<br> If you'll excuse me, sir.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, would you mind coming up to the Bridge? Lieutenant Uhura, how did all these tribbles get on the Bridge? I don't know, sir.<br> They do seem to be all over the ship.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Yes? Did you want to see me, Jim? Well, don't look at me, it's the tribbles who are breeding.<br> And if we don't get them off this ship, we'll be hip deep in them.<br> Would you explain that? Well, the nearest thing I can figure out is that they're born pregnant.<br> Which seems to be quite a time saver.<br> I know, but really And from my observations, it seems they're bisexual, reproducing at will.<br> And, brother, have they got a lot of will.<br> Captain, I am forced to agree with the doctor.<br> I've been running computations on their rate of reproduction.<br> The figures are taking an alarming direction.<br> They are consuming our supplies and returning nothing.<br> But they do give us something, Mr.<br> Spock, they give us love.<br> Well, Cyrano Jones says that a tribble is the only love that money can buy.<br> Too much of anything, lieutenant, even love, isn't necessarily a good thing.<br> Yes, captain.<br> Get a maintenance crew to clean up the entire ship.<br> And then contact Mr.<br> Lurry and tell him I'm beaming down.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Have him find Cyrano Jones and hold him.<br> And get these tribbles off the Bridge.<br> Aye, aye, captain.<br> Captain Kirk, I'm mystified at your tone of voice.<br> I've done nothing to warrant such severe treatment.<br> Oh, really? Surely you must have realised what would happen if you removed the tribbles from their predator-filled environment into an environment where their natural multiplicative proclivities would have no restraining factors.<br> Well, of cour What did you say? By removing the tribbles from their natural habitat, you have, so to speak, removed the cork from the bottle and allowed the genie to escape.<br> Well, if by that you mean, do they breed quickly? Well, of course, that's how I maintain my stock.<br> But breeding animals is not against regulations, only breeding dangerous ones.<br> - And tribbles are not dangerous.<br> - Just incredibly prolific.<br> Precisely.<br> And at 6 credits a head Well, that is, a body it mounts up.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me.<br> You ought to sell an instruction and maintenance manual with this thing.<br> If I did, what would happen to man's search for knowledge? Well, I must be tending my ship.<br> Go ahead, sir, tell him.<br> Captain Kirk, I consider your security measures a disgrace.<br> In my opinion, you have taken this entire very important project too lightly.<br> On the contrary, sir, I think of this project as very important.<br> It is you I take lightly.<br> I am going to report fully, to the proper authorities, that you have given free and complete access to this station to a man who is quite probably a Klingon agent.<br> That's a very serious charge.<br> To whom are you referring? To that man who just walked out of here.<br> Cyrano Jones? A Klingon agent? - You heard me.<br> - I heard you.<br> He simply could not believe his ears.<br> What evidence do you have against Mr.<br> Jones? My assistant here has kept Mr.<br> Jones under close surveillance for quite some time, and his actions have been most suspicious.<br> I believe he was involved in that little altercation between your men Yes, yes, go on.<br> What else do you have? Well, captain, I checked his ship's log and it seems that he was within the Klingons' sphere of influence less than four months ago.<br> The man is an independent scout, captain.<br> It's quite possible that he is also a Klingon spy.<br> We have already checked on the background of Mr.<br> Cyrano Jones.<br> He is a licensed asteroid locator and prospector.<br> He's never broken the law, at least not severely, and for the past seven years, with his one-man spaceship, he has obtained a marginal living by engaging in the buying and selling of rare merchandise, including, unfortunately, tribbles.<br> - But he is after my grain! - Do you have any proof of that? You can't deny he's disrupted this station.<br> People have disrupted stations before without being Klingon agents.<br> Sometimes all they need is a title, Mr.<br> Baris.<br> Unfortunately, disrupting a space station is not an offence.<br> Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a ship to tend to.<br> My chicken sandwich and coffee.<br> This is my chicken sandwich and coffee.<br> Fascinating.<br> I want these things off the ship.<br> I don't care if it takes every man, I want them off the ship.<br> Aye, they're into the machinery, all right.<br> And they're probably in all the other food processors too.<br> - How? - Probably through one of the air vents.<br> Captain, there are vents of that type on the space station.<br> And in the storage compartments.<br> This is Kirk.<br> Contact Manager Lurry and Nilz Baris.<br> Have them meet us near the storage compartments.<br> We're beaming down.<br> Come on, Spock.<br> Energize.<br> What's wrong? Plenty, if what I think happened has happened.<br> - Guard, is that door secure? - Yes, sir, nothing could get in.<br> Good.<br> Open it.<br> It's not working, sir.<br> It seems to be stuck.<br> Here, let me try.<br> They seem to be gorged.<br> Gorged? On my grain? Kirk, I am going to hold you responsible.<br> - There must be thousands of them.<br> - Hundreds of thousands.<br> That's assuming one tribble, multiplying with an average litter of ten, producing a new generation every And that's assuming that they got here three days ago.<br> And allowing for the amount of grain consumed and the volume of the storage compartment.<br> Kirk, you should have known! You are responsible for turning the development project into a total disaster! - Mr.<br> Baris - And I am through being intimidated.<br> Now, you have insulted me, you have ignored me, you've walked all over me! You have abused your authority, and you have rejected my requests.<br> And this! This is the result.<br> I am going to hold you responsible, Kirk.<br> Mr.<br> Baris, I'll hold you in irons if you don't shut up.<br> Jim, I think I've got it.<br> All we have to do is quit feeding them.<br> We quit feeding them, they stop breeding.<br> Now he tells me.<br> Captain, this tribble is dead.<br> And so are these.<br> A lot of them are dead.<br> A lot of them are alive, but they won't be for long.<br> A logical assumption is that there is something in the grain.<br> Yes.<br> Bones, I want the tribbles, the grain, everything analysed.<br> I wanna know what killed these tribbles.<br> I haven't figured out what keeps them alive yet.<br> All right, if I find out anything, I'll let you know.<br> That isn't gonna do you any good, Kirk.<br> This project is ruined, and Starfleet is gonna hear about it.<br> And when they do, they will have a board of enquiry and they will roast you alive.<br> And I am gonna be there, Kirk, to enjoy every minute of it.<br> Until that board of enquiry, I'm still the captain.<br> And as captain, I want two things done.<br> First, find Cyrano Jones, and second close that door.<br> Really, Captain Kirk, I must protest this treatment! Mr.<br> Jones, with an armful.<br> - A few questions.<br> - Captain Kirk! Yes, what do you want? An official apology, addressed to the Klingon High Command.<br> I expect you to assume full responsibility for the persecution of Klingon nationals in this quadrant.<br> An apology? Yes.<br> You've harassed my men.<br> You've treated them like criminals.<br> You've been most uncourteous, Captain Kirk.<br> Now, if you wish to avoid a diplomatic incident No, Kirk, you can't let him.<br> That will give them the wedge they need to claim Sherman's Planet.<br> I believe that more than the word of an aggrieved Klingon commander would be necessary for that, Mr.<br> Baris.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, as far as Sherman's Planet is concerned, Captain Kirk has already given it to us.<br> Well, we'll see about that.<br> But before I take any official action, I'd like to know just what happened.<br> Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale, and what was in the grain that killed them? Captain Kirk, before you go on, may I make a request? Yes.<br> Can you get those things out of here? - Remarkable.<br> - Hold on a minute.<br> I thought you said tribbles liked everybody.<br> Well, they do.<br> I can't understand it.<br> The last time I saw one act this way was at the bar.<br> - What was in the bar? - Klingons.<br> Him, for one.<br> You're right, Mr.<br> Jones.<br> They don't like Klingons.<br> But they do like Vulcans.<br> Why, Mr.<br> Spock, I didn't know you had it in you.<br> Obviously, tribbles are very perceptive creatures, captain.<br> Obviously.<br> Mr.<br> Baris, they like you.<br> Well, there's no accounting for taste.<br> They don't like you, Mr.<br> Darvin.<br> I wonder why.<br> Bones? Heartbeat is all wrong.<br> His body temperature is Jim, this man is a Klingon.<br> A Klingon? I wonder what Starfleet Command will say about that.<br> What about the grain, Bones? - Oh, yes.<br> It was poisoned.<br> - Poisoned? Yes, it's been impregnated with a virus.<br> The virus turns into an inert material in the bloodstream, and the more the organism eats, the more inert matter is built up.<br> So after two or three days it would reach a point where they couldn't take in enough nourishment to survive.<br> They starved to death.<br> In a storage compartment full of grain, they starved to death.<br> That is essentially it.<br> - Mr.<br> Darvin, you want to talk? - I have nothing to say.<br> All right! I poisoned the grain, take them away.<br> - The tribbles had nothing to do with it? - I don't know, I never saw one before, and I hope I never see one of those fuzzy, miserable things again.<br> I'm certain that can be arranged, Darvin.<br> Guards.<br> If you'll excuse me, captain.<br> Captain Koloth, about that apology.<br> Yes? You have six hours to get your ship out of Federation territory.<br> Hey, you know, I think I could learn to like tribbles.<br> Well, captain, I suppose I'm free to go now.<br> No, you're not.<br> There's something I want to show you.<br> Do you know what the penalty is for transporting an animal proven harmful to human life? Captain, one little tribble isn't harmful.<br> Captain, you wouldn't do a thing like that to me, now, would you? Would you? The penalty is 20 years in a rehabilitation colony.<br> Captain Kirk Friend! Friend Kirk.<br> Surely we can come to some sort of mutual understanding.<br> After all, my tribbles did put you wise to the poisoned grain and they did help you to find the Klingon agent.<br> We saved a lot of lives that way.<br> - There is one thing you can do.<br> - Yes.<br> Pick up every tribble on the space station.<br> If you do that, I'll speak to Mr.<br> Lurry about returning your spaceship.<br> It would take years.<br> Seventeen-point-nine, to be exact.<br> Seventeen-point-nine years? Consider it job security.<br> Captain, you're a hard man.<br> All right, all right! - You'll do it? - He'll do it.<br> I'll do it.<br> Captain, Starfleet was able to divert that freighter.<br> Good, that means Sherman's Planet will get its quadrotriticale only a few weeks late.<br> I don't see any tribbles around here.<br> And you won't find a tribble on this entire ship.<br> Bones, how'd you do that? Well, I cannot take credit for another man's work.<br> - Scotty did it.<br> - Scotty! Where are the tribbles? Captain, it was really Mr.<br> Spock's recommendation.<br> Of course.<br> Spock? Based on computer analysis, of course, taking into account the possibilities of Gentlemen, I don't want to interrupt this mutual-admiration society, but I'd like to know where the tribbles are.<br> Tell him, Spock.<br> Well, it was Mr.<br> Scott who performed the actual engineering.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Where are the tribbles? I used the transporter, captain.<br> - You used the transporter? - Aye.<br> Well, where did you transport them? Scott, you didn't transport them into space, did you? Captain Kirk, that would be inhuman! - Well, where are they? - I gave them a very good home.<br> - Where? - I gave them to the Klingons, sir.<br> - You gave them to the Klingons? - Aye, sir.<br> Before they went into warp, I transported the whole kit and caboodle to their Engine Room, where they'll be no tribble at all.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Must be a transporter malfunction.<br> That was a rough trip.<br> This isn't Gamma II.<br> Look at the colour of that sky.<br> This is the craziest landing pad I've ever seen.<br> And that's a trinary sun.<br> - Scott to Bridge.<br> - Spock here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the captain, Lieutenant Uhura and Chekov, they vanished.<br> They got onto the transporter platform and they just vanished.<br> I presume you mean they vanished in a manner not consistent with the usual workings of the transporter, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Why, of course I mean that.<br> Do you think I'd call you if they just beamed down? - Have you reversed controls? - I've made all the proper checks.<br> There was nothing.<br> There was no flash of light, nothing! - They were gone.<br> - Power surge? Not down here.<br> All the dials were right and the transporter was functioning perfectly.<br> Recheck your equipment, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I'll scan for them on the planet's surface.<br> Spock out.<br> But, captain, if we're not on Gamma II, then where are we? That's what I'd like to know.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Dead.<br> - Mine too.<br> - Captain, look.<br> Phasers on stun.<br> Fire! Hand-to-hand.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 3211.<br>8.<br> While beaming down from the Enterprise to inspect facilities on Gamma II, the normal transporter sequence has been interrupted and we find ourselves on a strange and hostile planet, surrounded by creatures belonging to races scattered all through the galaxy.<br> Excellent, Captain Kirk.<br> Although we expected strength and competitive spirit, we are greatly pleased.<br> Either of you hurt? I don't think so, captain.<br> Nobody's hurt, captain.<br> Yet.<br> Admirable, Chekov, admirable.<br> You also, Uhura.<br> Your spirit is as great as the captain's.<br> I can see you will all prove invaluable here.<br> I am Galt, master thrall of the planet Triskelion.<br> I have been sent to welcome you.<br> There, captain.<br> Now you are prepared for your training.<br> How do you know our names? The Providers were expecting you, captain.<br> They arranged your transportation.<br> - These Providers of yours, are they.<br>.<br>? - Correction, captain.<br> The Providers are not ours.<br> We are theirs.<br> - What do they want from us? - You are to be trained, of course.<br> What other use is there for thralls? Thralls? You must be mistaken.<br> We're officers of a United spaceship on Federation business.<br> There has been no mistake.<br> Your old titles mean nothing here, captain.<br> You are thralls now.<br> You are to be taken to the training enclosure.<br> Come, places have been prepared for you.<br> We're not going anywhere until we have some information.<br> Who are you? What is this place? What do you think you'll do with us? I am Galt, the master thrall.<br> This place is the planet Triskelion.<br> You are to be trained and spend the rest of your lives here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I've checked that transporter from one end to the other.<br> Every circuit works perfectly.<br> Whatever that power surge was, it had nothing to do with the transporter or with any other system aboard this ship.<br> I'm beginning to believe that, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I've conducted two sweeps of the planet's surface.<br> There is no sign of life.<br> Then what the devil is happening? Does that mean their atoms are just floating around out there? No, doctor.<br> Even that would show up on our sensors.<br> Where are they, then? The only answers are negative.<br> No magnetic storms, no ionic interference, no breakdown in your equipment.<br> A negative attitude is no good to us.<br> We can't just leave them out there.<br> Wherever they are.<br> We shall continue sensor scans, doctor.<br> At the moment, that is all we can do, except hope for a rational explanation.<br> Hope? I always thought that was a human failing, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> True, doctor.<br> Constant exposure does result in a certain degree of contamination.<br> These are your quarters.<br> Open, thralls.<br> That was foolish, captain.<br> Escape is quite impossible, as demonstrated by your collars of obedience.<br> Return to your quarters.<br> They're not within the confines of this solar system.<br> It's been nearly an hour.<br> Can people live that long as disassembled atoms in a transporter beam? I have never heard of a study being done.<br> But it would be a fascinating project.<br> Fascinating? Those people are friends of ours out there, if they're still alive.<br> - Precisely.<br> - Well, the odds are not good.<br> - No.<br> I would say approximately 400 - Don't quote odds, and don't give me any more dispassionate logic, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Just keep looking for them.<br> - I'd welcome a suggestion, doctor, even an emotional one, as to where to look.<br> The first time you've ever asked me for anything and it has to be an occasion like this.<br> Captain, the Enterprise, they will be trying to find us, won't they? They'll be trying.<br> But where do they look? We're here and we don't know where it is.<br> This system's star is a trinary.<br> Limits it a bit.<br> But we're a long way from the Enterprise if we're even in the same dimension.<br> I am your drill thrall.<br> - I am called Lars.<br> - What do you want from her? That is not your concern.<br> Your drill thralls will attend you presently.<br> There is little time.<br> What are you doing? - Get out.<br> - I have been selected for you.<br> Lieutenant, are you all right? Uhura.<br> Lieutenant? Lieutenant, are you all right? Lieutenant, answer me! Lieutenant? What's happening to Lieutenant Uhura? Lieutenant, are you all right?

Exactly the question I've just fed to the computers, doctor.<br> And the answer is nothing known to us would account for it.<br> The transporter has neither the power nor the range to account for that.<br> - Plot a follow course, Ensign Haines.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> You're going to leave here without them and run off on some wild-goose chase halfway across the galaxy just because you found a discrepancy in a hydrogen cloud? Doctor, I am chasing the captain, Lieutenant Uhura and Ensign Chekov, not some wild aquatic fowl.<br> This is the only lead we've had.<br> Course plotted and laid in, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Three-10, mark 241.<br> Initiate.<br> Warp factor 2.<br> You? You have been selected for me? No.<br> I am only your drill thrall.<br> I have brought you nourishment.<br> It is a nice name, Chee-koo.<br> Chekov.<br> Chee-koof.<br> It is a very nice name.<br> I am called Tamoon.<br> Pleased Pleased to know you miss? You are a fine specimen.<br> I like you better than the others.<br> I will instruct you well, so my Provider will take you.<br> That's very kind of you, miss, but If my Provider is pleased, we may even be selected for each other.<br> I didn't realise I was so hungry.<br> Whatever you call this, it was very good.<br> It is nourishment.<br> We call it that.<br> Nourishment.<br> That's very practical.<br> - What do you call this collar? - It is the sign of our Provider.<br> By the colour of the lights it can be known who holds us.<br> When you are vended, you will also have a colour.<br> Vended? You mean bought? Sold? When you are developed.<br> The Provider who offers the most quatloos puts his colour on us.<br> Our race has another name for it: Slavery.<br> This collar of obedience is Galt the only one who can operate it? It is only to warn and punish.<br> - How does he work it? - It is not permitted to talk of that.<br> Will you provide all my nourishment? Of course.<br> I am your drill thrall.<br> I will train you well.<br> Yes, I'm sure you will.<br> I must say, I've never seen a top sergeant who looked like you.<br> What does that mean? It means you're a very beautiful woman.<br> What is \"beautiful\"? You mean nobody's ever told you that before? Well, beautiful is Beautiful That's beautiful.<br> Shahna, where were you born? Born? I have been here always.<br> Your parents, where are they? Your mother and father.<br> She who bore me was killed in a freestyle match.<br> - Freestyle? - You will learn all these things.<br> Lars, and Chekov's drill thrall, they weren't born here.<br> - Where do they come from? - It is not permitted The exercise interval.<br> This is your training harness.<br> Put it on.<br> This is ridiculous.<br> Nothing out there.<br> Nothing out there at all.<br> We certainly seem to be heading into an empty sector.<br> Projecting back along the path of ionization, the nearest system is M24 Alpha.<br> That must be two dozen light-years away.<br> Are you suggesting that they could have transported over a distance of? You're out of your Vulcan mind, Spock! I am suggesting nothing, doctor.<br> I am merely pursuing the only logical course available to us.<br> Hold! This thrall was slow in obeying a command.<br> For his punishment, he will be practise target.<br> As you charge, you will strike the practise target when you pass.<br> You begin, Uhura.<br> No.<br> It is not allowed to refuse a training exercise.<br> I don't care whether it's allowed or not.<br> I will not do it! None of us will do it, Galt.<br> It is part of your training.<br> The Providers wish it.<br> - The devil with the Providers.<br> - Cossacks! We have been tolerant because you are newcomers.<br> But I see you must be given a lesson.<br> Lars.<br> Kloog.<br> Kloog will administer correction.<br> Uhura, take your place on the Triad.<br> - Tie her.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> I'm responsible for the actions of my people.<br> I demand to see the Providers.<br> It is not permitted.<br> But, captain, since you assume responsibility for your people, you will take the punishment.<br> It is less painful than the collar.<br> Turn around.<br> Captain, you will be practise target.<br> It is a shame to lose you, captain, but it is worth it as an example to the others.<br> Captain's log, supplemental.<br> Stardate unknown.<br> Our strange captivity continues.<br> This planet is called Triskelion.<br> We do not know its location.<br> We do not know who controls it.<br> Its dangers are abundantly clear.<br> Hold!

Two thousand.<br> Two thousand quatloos are bid.<br> Is there a challenge? The newcomers have been vended to Provider One.<br> We're free people.<br> We belong to no one.<br> Such spirit! I wager 15 quatloos that he is untrainable.<br> Twenty quatloos that all three are untrainable.<br> Five thousand quatloos that the newcomers will have to be destroyed.<br> Accepted.<br> Mark them, Galt.<br> You now bear the mark of a fine herd.<br> But I must warn you, any further disobedience now that you are full-fledged thralls will be punishable by death.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, it just doesn't make sense they could have come this far.<br> If there's any chance at all, it's to continue to search in the area they were lost.<br> We searched the area.<br> It's always possible to miss something.<br> Such as a failure in the transporter mechanism? No, sir.<br> There was no sign of failure.<br> There was no sign of them in the area of Gamma II.<br> If they weren't there, it's just ridiculous to think they could still be alive.<br> Not after all this time.<br> In that case, we have nothing to lose by pursuing our present course.<br> Slow down.<br> Slow down.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait up.<br> We've covered over two miles.<br> Can we take a breather? A rest.<br> - Very well, if you are tired.<br> - Yes.<br> Well, it's good to get away from that development area, even for a while.<br> Shahna, why do the Providers? Why do they like to watch others being hurt, killed? That is the way.<br> Their voices sound mechanical.<br> - Are they computers? - Computers? You've seen them? Do they have bodies? Not such as ours.<br> What is this place? It is not used.<br> It's very old.<br> Does it have a name? Shahna could it have been a city for the Providers? I do not think it is well to ask such things.<br> They do have bodies, or did have? One does not talk of such things.<br> Very pretty country.<br> Very much like my home planet, Earth.<br> - Planet? - Where I was born.<br> Shahna, don't you ever look at the night sky? The lights up there? I have looked at them.<br> Well, those are stars.<br> And around them are planets.<br> And there are people that live on them, just like us.<br> How can one live on a flicker of light? From Earth, Triskelion's three suns are just a flicker of light.<br> Actually, this is the darkest planet I've ever seen.<br> Dark? But all is lighted.<br> Here, the chambers.<br> The thralls have no freedom, Shahna.<br> You don't think or do anything but what the Providers tell you.<br> What else would one do? Love, for one thing.<br> What is love? Love is the most important thing on Earth, especially to a man and a woman.<br> We, too, have mates.<br> When it is time to increase the herd, my Provider will select one for me.<br> On Earth, we select our own mate.<br> Someone we care for.<br> On Earth, men and women live together help each other, make each other happy.<br> I do not think your words are allowed.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> Tell me about the Providers.<br> What do they look like? Where do they live? I have never seen them, but they are said not to be like us.<br> They stay in Stop it.<br> Stop it! I'm responsible! I made her talk! Stop it! You're killing her! She did nothing wrong.<br> It was my fault.<br> If you want to punish someone, punish me.<br> Please.<br> Is that what you humans call compassion? It is interesting, but it has no value here.<br> You present many interesting aspects, captain.<br> But you must learn obedience.<br> Then you will be an excellent thrall.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> You can stop crying now, Shahna.<br> It's all right.<br> You You risked bringing their anger on yourself.<br> Why did you do it? It's the custom of my people to help one another when we're in trouble.<br> And And this is this also \"helping\"? You could call it that.<br> Please, help me once again.<br> I did not know it could be like this between people.<br> Is it always so in the place you come from? Captain, you do indeed present many surprises.<br> Because you have amused the Providers, there will be no punishment.<br> Return to your quarters.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, can we manage anything faster than warp 6? It's my opinion that we've gone too far as it is, sir.<br> He's right, Spock.<br> We've lost Jim and the others back on Gamma II.<br> You've dragged us out here a dozen light-years on some wild hunch that Doctor, I do not respond to hunches.<br> No transporter malfunction was responsible for the disappearance.<br> They were not within the Gamma system.<br> A focused beam of extremely high-intensity light was directed into the Gamma system from the trinary system we are now approaching.<br> No known natural phenomena could have caused that beam.<br> - Does that clarify the situation? - No, it doesn't, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It's still a fancy way of saying that you're playing a hunch.<br> Well, my hunch is that they're back on Gamma II, dead or alive, and I still want another search.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy speaks for me too, sir.<br> I see.<br> Gentlemen, I am in command of this vessel, and we shall continue on our present course unless it is your intention to declare a mutiny.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Who said anything about a mutiny, you stubborn, pointed-eared? All right, if we don't find them here, will we still have another search on Gamma II? Agreed.<br> Now, Mr.<br> Scott, could you manage warp 7? I'd be more than content to do so, sir.<br> And maybe a wee bit more.<br> Ensign, warp 7.<br> You're disturbed about what happened today.<br> Yes.<br> You have made me feel strangely.<br> If it were allowed, I would ask that you have another drill thrall.<br> I wouldn't like that, Shahna.<br> I wouldn't like that at all.<br> I'm sorry, Shahna.<br> This is going to kill our romance.<br> - What about Lars? - He's gone to report me.<br> I told him I didn't like the food.<br> I think Galt is the only one who controls these collars.<br> If we can find the phaser that I threw at Lars, we can use the circuits to short out these collars.<br> Captain.<br> Only a reminder.<br> You Earth people are most unusual, most stimulating.<br> Standard orbit.<br> Sensors indicate only one concentration of life forms on the planet, on the lower hemisphere.<br> Humanoid readings.<br> At least that gives our landing force a starting point.<br> There will be no landing force, doctor.<br> Assuming the captain and the others are still alive, it would be unwise to endanger them by beaming down a large contingent.<br> We're not going to leave them there while we just sit and wait.<br> Interesting.<br> No power source.<br> It may be shielded.<br> It may be just a wild-goose chase, like we've been telling you.<br> I shall beam down, doctor.<br> If I'm unable to communicate, a landing party may be necessary.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock, if you're going into the lion's den, you'll need a medical officer.<br> Daniel, as I recall, had only his faith.<br> But I welcome your company, doctor.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, you'll be in command.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> No, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You will not leave the ship.<br> None of your control systems will operate.<br> What the devil's going on? Spock? Spock? Spock! Welcome to Triskelion, gentlemen.<br> By now, it must be obvious to you that you have been expected.<br> What the voice said was true, sir.<br> Nothing is functioning.<br> Commendations, gentlemen.<br> Your ingenuity in discovering the whereabouts of your companions is noteworthy.<br> What you're hearing, gentlemen, is a Provider.<br> We are known to the thralls as Providers because we provide for all their needs.<br> The term is easier for their limited mental abilities to comprehend.<br> Providing for all their needs means using thralls, people stolen from other parts of the galaxy, to fight each other, and the Providers gamble on the winner.<br> Fascinating.<br> But these Providers haven't the courage to show themselves.<br> Your species has great curiosity.<br> We knew that.<br> You are interesting in many ways.<br> But you are afraid.<br> You present no danger while you wear the collar.<br> And you wear it as long as you live.<br> Then show yourself.<br> There is no objection.<br> The power source.<br> Shielded by solid rock.<br> We are 1,000 of your metres beneath the surface.<br> Primary mental evolution.<br> Incredible.<br> That is not true, captain.<br> Once we had humanoid form, but we evolved beyond it.<br> Through aeons of devoting ourselves exclusively to intellectual pursuits, we became the physically simple, mentally superior creature you see before you.<br> A species that enslaves other beings is hardly superior, mentally or otherwise.<br> The thralls are necessary to the games.<br> We have found athletic competitions our only challenge, the only thing which furnishes us with purpose.<br> It's an unproductive purpose, unworthy of your intellect.<br> We use only inferior beings.<br> We have found that all life forms in the galaxy are capable of superior development.<br> Perhaps you're not as evolved as you believe.<br> An interesting speculation, captain.<br> You and your people are most challenging.<br> Yes, most challenging.<br> It was hoped that such new blood would stimulate our stock of thralls.<br> How unfortunate that you must be destroyed.<br> Our destruction will result only in your own.<br> You may control the Enterprise, but you cannot match the force of the entire Federation.<br> Your ship will be destroyed by a magnetic storm.<br> No communications with your base will be possible.<br> Your fate will remain a mystery to your people.<br> And you call yourselves superior! You're murderers without the spirit to really wager for the lives you take! Wager? Explain yourself, captain.<br> My people pride themselves on being the greatest, most successful gamblers in the universe.<br> We compete for everything: Power, fame, women.<br> Everything we desire.<br> And it is our nature to win.<br> For proof, I offer you our exploration of this galaxy.<br> We are aware of your competitive abilities, captain.<br> Well, then I wager that with weapons of your own choice, right here and now, my people can overcome an equal number of thralls set against us.<br> A hundred quatloos on the newcomers.<br> Four hundred quatloos against the newcomers.<br> Two hundred quatloos against! Five hundred for the newcomers.<br> Contest by multiple elimination.<br> Wait! Wait! Hear me.<br> We can't wager for trifles like quatloos.<br> The stakes must be higher.<br> Name your stakes, captain.<br> If we win, the Enterprise and its crew leaves here in safety.<br> Furthermore, all the thralls on the planet must be freed.<br> Anarchy.<br> They would starve.<br> You will educate and train them to establish a normal self-governing culture.<br> Thralls govern themselves? Ridiculous! We have done the same with cultures throughout the galaxy.<br> Are you willing to admit that we can do something you can't? - There is nothing we cannot do.<br> - And if you lose, captain? If we lose? We will remain here.<br> The entire crew of the Enterprise.<br> The most stubborn, determined competitors in the universe.<br> We'll become thralls, enter your games, obey your orders without rebellion.<br> You'll be assured of generations of the most exciting wagering you've ever had.<br> Your stakes are indeed high, captain.<br> Not for true gamesters.<br> We will accept your stakes on one condition.<br> Name it.<br> As leader of your people, your spirit seems most indomitable.<br> We suggest you, alone, pitted against three contestants of our choosing.<br> Three against one? Those are pretty high odds.<br> Not for true gamesters, captain.<br> Your terms are unfair.<br> On the contrary, they're extremely fair.<br> Since your alternative is death.<br> Well, in that case, I'll accept your terms.<br> Galt will prepare you.<br> Because you wager your skill for all your people, they will be permitted to watch the outcome of the game on the ship's viewscreen.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, look.<br> - Captain, you will defend.<br> Thralls must stay in the blue area.<br> You will take the yellow.<br> Touching an opposing colour deprives a contestant of one weapon.<br> An opponent must be killed to be removed from the game.<br> If only wounded, he is replaced by a fresh thrall.<br> Is that clear, captain? Yes, that's clear.<br> What in the name of heaven is this? Heaven's got very little to do with this.<br> Shahna.<br> You lied.<br> Everything you said.<br> The thralls surrender! You have won, Captain Kirk, unfortunately.<br> However, the terms of the wager will be honoured.<br> You are free.<br> Remove your collars.<br> The thralls will be trained? They will be trained.<br> We have said it.<br> I think you'll find it a much more exciting game than the one you've been playing.<br> I'm sorry, Shahna.<br> I didn't lie.<br> I did what was necessary.<br> - Someday I hope you'll understand.<br> - I understand.<br> A little.<br> You will leave us now? Yeah.<br> To go back to the lights in the sky? Yes.<br> I would like to go to those lights with you.<br> - Take me.<br> - I can't.<br> Then teach me how, and I will follow you.<br> There is so much you must learn here first.<br> The Providers will teach you.<br> Learn it, Shahna.<br> All your people must learn before you can reach for the stars.<br> Shahna.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Beam us up.<br> Goodbye, Jim Kirk.<br> I will learn and watch the lights in the sky and remember.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tApproaching Sigma lotia II, captain.<br> - Standard orbit, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Captain.<br> I have received vocal contact from an official station.<br> They relayed us to a man named Oxmyx.<br> His title is boss.<br> Boss? All right, lieutenant, put him on.<br> Oxmyx.<br> This is Captain James T.<br> Kirk of the starship Enterprise, representing the Federation of Planets.<br> Hello, captain.<br> You're from the same outfit as the Horizon? Yes.<br> Unfortunately, the Horizon was lost with all hands shortly after leaving your planet.<br> We only received her radio report last month.<br> Last month? What are you talking about? The Horizon left here a hundred years ago.<br> Well, it's a little difficult to explain.<br> We received a report a hundred years late because it was sent by conventional radio.<br> Your system is on the outer reaches of the galaxy.<br> They didn't have subspace communication in those days.<br> Toward the edge of what? I'll explain it in more detail when I see him.<br> The ship won't land, but we'll transport several people down.<br> Well, that's a little difficult for you to understand too.<br> I'll explain it in more detail when I see you.<br> Where will be convenient? Well, there's an intersection just at the end of the block.<br> Near a yellow fireplug.<br> - Yellow fireplug.<br> - Think you can find it? Scotty, do you have the coordinates? - Located, sir.<br> - Good.<br> Mr.<br> Oxmyx, we have your intersection located.<br> - Will five minutes be all right? - Fine, fine.<br> I'll have a reception committee there to meet you.<br> Good, I'll be looking forward to it.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Scotty, you have the com.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Spock, McCoy, we're beaming down.<br> Standard equipment.<br> The Horizon's contact came before the non-interference directive went into effect.<br> They must have interfered with the normal evolution of the planet.<br> It will be interesting to see the results of the contamination.<br> We don't know there is contamination.<br> The evidence is only circumstantial.<br> Well, what was the state of the lotian culture before the Horizon came? The beginnings of industrialisation.<br> Horizon reports indicate the lotians are extremely intelligent and somewhat imitative.<br> So we're going down to recontaminate them.<br> If the damage has been done, doctor, we are here to repair it.<br> Let's not argue about it, let's go study it.<br> Energize.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - This is like coming home.<br> Home was never like this.<br> I've seen pictures of the old days that looked like this.<br> Interesting, captain.<br> Passers-by are carrying, I believe, firearms.<br> Okay, you three, let's see you petrify.<br> Sir, would you mind explaining that statement, please? I wanna see you turn to stone.<br> Put your hands over your head, or you ain't gonna have no head to put your hands over.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> What's this? That's a weapon.<br> Be careful with that.<br> A heater, huh? Hey, the boss will love that.<br> Now, look, we were asked to come down here by a Mr.<br> Oxmyx.<br> - He said - I know what he said, bud.<br> He said some of the boys would meet you.<br> - Okay, we're meeting you.<br> - Those firearms are not necessary.<br> - You trying to make trouble? - Who, me? Don't give me those baby blue eyes.<br> - What? - I don't go for that innocent routine.<br> Sir, does everyone here carry firearms? I never heard such stupid questions in my life.<br> Well, since this Oxmyx asked us down here, - don't you think we should see him? - All right, get moving.<br> Down the street.<br> Krako's getting more gall all the time.<br> - Is this how you greet all your guests? - It happens, pal.<br> - That man's dead back there.<br> - Well, we ain't playing for peanuts.<br> What's the matter, you guys never saw a hit before? Sir, there are several questions I would like to ask.<br> Ask the boss.<br> I don't know nothing.<br> Get moving.<br> That's the contamination you're looking for.<br> Yes, but the Horizon crew wasn't composed of cold-blooded killers, and they didn't report this culture in this state either.<br> What happened? Hey, Kalo.<br> Hey, when's the boss gonna do something about the crummy streetlights around here, huh? A girl ain't safe.<br> Yeah, and how about the laundry pickup? We ain't had a truck by in three weeks.<br> - Write him a letter.<br> - I did.<br> He sent it back with postage due.<br> Listen, we pay our percentages.<br> We're entitled to a little service for our money, huh? Get lost, will you? Some people got nothing to do but complain.<br> Is this the way your citizens do business? Their right of petition? They pay their percentages, and the boss takes care of them.<br> Hit that button.<br> - Yeah? - Got them, boss.<br> No sweat.<br> All right, bring them in.<br> Which one of you guys is the captain? It depends.<br> Make yourself a drink, captain.<br> It's good stuff.<br> I distill it myself.<br> - No, thank you.<br> You're Mr.<br> Oxmyx? - That's me, pal.<br> This is my first officer, Mr.<br> Spock, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Doctor, huh? Put the chopper down, Kalo.<br> These guys are our guests.<br> Pick up a cue, captain.<br> Go ahead.<br> You gotta excuse my boys.<br> Can't be too careful around here these days.<br> Yes.<br> Judging from what we've seen so far, I agree.<br> They call you the boss, Mr.<br> Oxmyx.<br> The boss of what? The boss of my territory.<br> I got the biggest in the world.<br> You know, there's one thing wrong with having the biggest.<br> There's always some punk trying to cut you out.<br> That's why you can't be too careful.<br> - You're the government here? - What government? Like I told you, I got the territory and I run it, that's all.<br> But there are other bosses, other territories? Yeah, sure.<br> Maybe a dozen or so.<br> Not counting the small fry.<br> But then they get burned anyway, as soon as I get around to it.<br> Does that include, if I may ask, a gentleman called Krako? - How do you know about Krako? - He hit us, boss.<br> Okay.<br> You hit him back, you hear? Hard.<br> I'll take care of it.<br> Captain? Doctor? - Gangsters.<br> - Chicago Mobs.<br> Published in 1992.<br> - Where'd you get this? - Hey, hey, wait a minute.<br> - That's the Book.<br> - I know it's a book.<br> The Book.<br> They left it.<br> The other ship, the Horizon.<br> This is the contamination, captain.<br> Astonishing.<br> An entire culture based on this.<br> You said they were imitative and the book - No more cracks about the Book.<br> - Did they leave any other books? Yeah, sure.<br> Some textbooks on how to make radio sets and stuff like that but Look, I brought you down here so you could help me, not for you to ask me questions.<br> After that, I'll answer anything you wanna know.<br> What is it you want? Well, I was thinking.<br> You Feds must have made a lot of improvements since that other ship came here.<br> You probably got all kinds of fancy heaters up there.<br> So here's the deal.<br> You give me all the heaters I need, enough tools so I can knock off all those punks all at once.<br> Then I'll take over, and all you have to do - is deal with me.<br> - Let me get this straight.<br> You want us to supply you with arms and assistance so you can carry out an aggression against your neighbours? What aggression? I gotta make some hits.<br> I want you to help me hit them, that's all.<br> Fascinating, but quite impossible.<br> Mr.<br> Oxmyx, my orders are quite explicit.<br> Under no I ain't interested in your orders.<br> From now on, you're gonna take orders from me.<br> I'm gonna give you just eight hours to give me the things I want.<br> If I don't have those tools by then, I'm gonna call up your ship and have them pick you up in a box.<br> Is that understood, pal? Hey, boss.<br> This here's a heater, and I don't know what this is.<br> - Well, let's see how this thing works.<br> - Don't do that.<br> You could knock out the side of the building.<br> That good, huh? All you have to do is give me about 100 of these fancy heaters, and we'll have no more trouble.<br> Out of the question.<br> Captain Kirk, I usually get what I want.<br> What's this thing? - All right, burn them! - Now, hold it.<br> It's a communication device.<br> How does it work? It's locked onto my ship's system Kalo, take them to the warehouse and put them in the bag.<br> - Keep a sharp eye on them, you hear? - In the bag, boss.<br> Come on.<br> Hey, you.<br> In the ship up there.<br> - Hey, you in the ship.<br> - Scott here.<br> Who's this? This is Bela Oxmyx.<br> I got your captain and his friends down here.<br> You wanna see them alive, you'll send me down a hundred of these fancy heaters you got, and some troops to show me how to use them.<br> Am I to understand that you're holding the captain and his party? You heard right, pal.<br> I'm gonna give you just eight hours to get me the goods I want, or I put the hit on your friends.<br> You understand? I don't know.<br> Lieutenant Hadley, check the language banks and find out what a heater is.<br> One book on the gangs of Chicago did all this.<br> - It's amazing.<br> - They evidently seized upon that one book as the blueprint for an entire society.<br> - As the Bible.<br> - In old Chicago, conventional government almost broke down.<br> The gangs nearly took over.<br> Yeah, well, this Oxmyx is the worst gangster of all.<br> We may quarrel with Mr.<br> Oxmyx's methods, but his goal is essentially the correct one.<br> This society must become united or it will degenerate into total anarchy.<br> If this society broke down as a result of the Horizon's influence, then the Federation is responsible, and we've got to do something to straighten this mess out.<br> Spock, if you could get to the sociological computers, do you think you could find a solution? Unfortunately, I do not have access to my computers, nor are these gentlemen likely to permit it.<br> Yeah.<br> Well, I've got an idea about that.<br> Gentlemen, gentlemen This This card game is a kid's game.<br> - You think so, huh? - Oh, yes, yes.<br> - I wouldn't waste my time.<br> - Who's asking you? On Beta Antares IV, they play a real game.<br> It's a man's game, but of course, probably a little beyond you.<br> It requires intelligence.<br> Listen, Kirk, I can play anything you can figure out.<br> Take the cards, big man.<br> - Show us how it's played.<br> - Captain, I am familiar with the culture on Beta Antares IV.<br> - Spock.<br> Spock.<br> - I don't know of any game Of course, the cards on Beta Antares IV are different, but not too different.<br> - Name of the game is called fizzbin.<br> - Fizzbin? Fizzbin.<br> It's not too difficult.<br> Each player gets six cards, except for the dealer, the player on the dealer's right who gets seven.<br> - On the right? - Yes.<br> The second card is turned up, except on Tuesday.<br> On Tuesday.<br> Oh, look what you got, two jacks.<br> You got a half-fizzbin already.<br> - I need another jack.<br> - No, no, if you got another jack, - why, you'd have a shralk.<br> - A shralk? Yes, you'd be disqualified.<br> No, what you need now is either a king and a deuce, except at night, of course, when you'd need a queen and a four.<br> - Except at night.<br> - Right.<br> Oh, look at that.<br> You got another jack! How lucky you are! How wonderful for you! Now, if you didn't get another jack, if you had gotten a king, why, then you'd get another card, except when it's dark, - when you'd have to give it back.<br> - If it were dark on Tuesday? Yes, but what you're after is a royal fizzbin, but the odds in getting a royal fizzbin are astron Spock, what are the odds in getting a royal fizzbin? I've never computed them, captain.<br> Well, they're astronomical, believe me.<br> Astronomical.<br> Now, for the last card, we'll call it a kronk.<br> - You got that? - What? I'll get it.<br> Spock, find the radio station.<br> Uhura is monitoring the broadcasts.<br> Cut in and have yourselves beamed up to the ship.<br> - Surely you're coming? - I will, - but I'm bringing Bela Oxmyx.<br> - Jim, you can't Bones, this mess is our responsibility.<br> You have your orders.<br> Let's go.<br> Hold it! - Okay, pally, we're going for a ride.<br> - If you don't mind, I'd rather walk.<br> Listen, pally, this could either be a taxi or a hearse.<br> You know what I mean? I'm beginning to get the idea.<br> You do that very well.<br> Now, how are you with primitive radio equipment? Very simple.<br> Amplitude modulation transmission.<br> I simply adjust the frequency, throw this switch, and the Enterprise should answer.<br> That was the Jailbreakers with their latest recording on Request Time, brought to you by Bang-Bang, the makers of the sweetest little automatic in the worl - Fascinating.<br> - And very simple.<br> Well, let me see.<br> Enterprise, this is Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Lieutenant Uhura here, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, what are you doing on this frequency? A very long and complicated story, lieutenant.<br> Notify the Transporter Room.<br> Two to beam up, these coordinates.<br> So you're the Fed, huh? - Well, well, well.<br> - And you? Krako.<br> Jojo Krako.<br> I'm the head of the whole southside territory.<br> Hey, I'm glad to see you.<br> Would you mind telling me how you even know who I am? Sit down, Kirk.<br> I've got all of Bela's communications bugged.<br> He can't make a date with a broad unless I know about it.<br> Well, I guess you wanna know why I brought you here.<br> You wanna make a deal.<br> Hey, I like that.<br> That is sharp.<br> - That's sharp, eh, Zabo? - Sharp, boss.<br> That's right, a deal.<br> I want you to help me.<br> Let me guess.<br> You want You want heaters, and then you'll want troops to teach them how to use them.<br> And then you'll attack the other bosses and take over the whole planet.<br> - Then we'll sit down and talk, right? - Wrong! I know Bela.<br> He didn't offer you beans.<br> Now, me, I'm a reasonable man.<br> You give me what I want, and I'll cut you in for, say, a third.<br> Skimmed right off the top.<br> Well, what do you think? I got a better idea.<br> This planet has to be united.<br> Now, you know that, Bela knows that.<br> Let's sit down.<br> You, me, Bela.<br> Discuss this whole matter, contact the other bosses, and talk about it like reasonable men.<br> You watch it, Kirk.<br> The Book tells us how to handle things.<br> You make hits.<br> Somebody argues, you lean on him.<br> You think we're stupid or something? No, no, no, I don't think you're stupid, Mr.<br> Krako, I just think your behaviour is arrested.<br> I've never been arrested in my whole life! Now, listen, pally, I know how to get what I want.<br> You wanna live, don't you, Kirk? You bet you do, but after I get through with you, you're liable to be sorry unless you come across.<br> Hold him here.<br> Tell Cirl the Knife to sharpen up his blade.<br> I just might have a job for him.<br> Unless you come across with the heaters.<br> I'm sorry, Krako.<br> No deal.<br> That's too bad.<br> Put him on ice.<br> - Well? - Futile, doctor.<br> No specifics.<br> There is no record of such a culture based on a moral inversion.<br> - You mean you're giving up? - No, doctor.<br> I'm merely saying the computers can offer us no logical, rational, factual way - out of our current dilemma.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Oxmyx is making contact from the surface.<br> On audio, lieutenant.<br> Mr.<br> Oxmyx, this is Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Hey, how'd you get back up there? - Irrelevant, since we are here.<br> - Oh, yeah.<br> I tell you, you better come on back down.<br> Krako's put the bag on your captain.<br> Why would he put a bag on our captain? Kidnapped him, you dope.<br> - He'll scrag him too.<br> - If I understand you correctly, that would seem to be a problem.<br> Look, you guys got something I want.<br> I can help you get your captain back.<br> Then we can talk about the deal I want.<br> I'm afraid I find it difficult to trust you, Mr.<br> Oxmyx.<br> What's to trust? Business is business.<br> We'll call a truce.<br> You come on down.<br> My boys will spring Kirk, and then we'll talk about giving me a hand.<br> You will show no further hostility? I'm a businessman, pally.<br> What do you say? Since we must have our captain back, I accept.<br> We shall arrive in your office within ten minutes.<br> Spock out.<br> You mean you're gonna trust him? If we are to save the captain without blatant, forceful interference on this planet, doctor, we must have the assistance of someone indigenous.<br> We are therefore forced to trust Mr.<br> Oxmyx.<br> Help me! Help! Help me! Help! Mr.<br> Scott, though we hope to avoid interference, I suggest you set one of our phaser banks on a strong stun position.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Now you're beginning to make sense.<br> I trust we shall not have to use them, but it is best to be prepared.<br> Energize.<br> - You know what to do.<br> - Don't worry, boss.<br> They can't do nothing till they're through sparkling.<br> Just the same, you be careful.<br> They'll have heaters on them.<br> Now, you watch this.<br> Ship's log, Mr.<br> Spock reporting.<br> Incredible as it seems, Dr.<br> McCoy and I are once again prisoners of the chief criminal boss of a society patterned after old Earth gangsters.<br> Pick up many more of these, I won't need your cooperation.<br> Mr.<br> Oxmyx, I understood we had an arrangement, a truce.<br> I was hoping you'd think that, dummy.<br> We're trying to help you, Oxmyx.<br> Nobody helps nobody but himself.<br> Sir, you are employing a double negative.<br> I fail to see why you do not understand us.<br> You yourself have stated the need for unity of authority on this planet.<br> - We agree.<br> - Yeah, but I gotta be the unity.<br> Cooperation, sir, would inevitably result The most cooperative man in this world is a dead man.<br> And if you don't keep your mouth shut, you're gonna be cooperating.<br> Drop the guns.<br> Drop them.<br> Move down there.<br> Hey, captain, you got away from Krako.<br> You know, that ain't easy.<br> You were supposed to report to the ship.<br> We did, captain.<br> The situation required our return.<br> It may be just as well.<br> - Find out anything from the computer? - Nothing useful.<br> Logic and practical information do not seem to apply here.<br> You admit that? To deny the facts would be illogical, doctor.<br> Then you don't mind if I play a hunch? I'm not sanguine about hunches, captain, but I have no practical alternative.<br> What are we gonna do now, Jim? Well, now that we have Bela, I'm gonna put the bag on Krako.<br> Now, listen, you Say, that's nice material.<br> - It ought to be.<br> It cost a bundle.<br> - Get out of them.<br> - Hey! - I said - Just a minute.<br> - You too! Get out of the clothes.<br> Nobody's gonna put the bag on me anymore.<br> Wheels, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A fliver, captain.<br> Key in the ignition, turn the ignition on And nothing happens.<br> Where's the starter? There's the starter.<br> Yeah.<br> Interesting.<br> - Gears.<br> - Yes, gears.<br> Oh, I believe they had a device known as a A clutch.<br> A clutch, captain.<br> Perhaps one of those pedals on the floor.<br> I kind of like this.<br> I may get one myself.<br> Captain, you are an excellent starship commander, but as a taxi driver, you leave much to be desired.<br> It was that bad? Now, that could be a bit of a problem.<br> If they were inside where they wouldn't be seen, we could stun them with our phasers, but not out here.<br> If we can get close enough to them, we should be able to render them harmless with a reasonable rapidity.<br> They don't look like the trusting type.<br> - It's a hit, ain't it? - I beg your pardon.<br> You're gonna hit somebody.<br> Can I watch? - Young man, run along and play.<br> - Where'd you get them ears? - Young man - You gonna hit Krako? Out here? You open up and you'll be scragged from every window on the street.<br> I can fix it for you.<br> Young man, this is likely to be quite hazardous.<br> - If I were you - Hold on, Spock.<br> - Out of the mouths of babes - Who are you calling a babe? - I'm calling you a babe.<br> - Calling me a babe? Yeah, I'm calling I'm calling you a babe, but there's nothing personal.<br> Sit down.<br> You know a way we could get close to them? - Sure.<br> - How? - What's in it for me? - What do you want? A piece of the action.<br> You do not even know what the action is going to be.<br> I figure it's gotta be a thick percentage, - or you wouldn't be trying to hit Krako.<br> - Logical.<br> All right, young man, we'll guarantee you a piece of the action if we can pull this thing off.<br> - Is that a contract? - Done.<br> - What do we do? - You'll know what to do.<br> And that! And how do you like that? And that! Think you can gang up on me, huh? What are you, chicken? Come on, why don't you gang up on me? I'll cut off your head and throw it in your face! Now, take that and that! And that! And how do you like that and.<br>.<br>? Daddy, Daddy, I hurt myself.<br> - Daddy, Daddy, I hurt myself.<br> - That's it.<br> Let's go.<br> What's the matter? Hurt yourself? - I want my daddy.<br> - Cute kid, ain't he? - Sure is.<br> - Daddy! - I want my Daddy! - Sonny! - I want my dad.<br> - Sonny.<br> - What's the matter? - Wait.<br> What have they done? What have they done to you? What have you done? A piece of the action.<br> No one can see.<br> Put your phaser on stun.<br> Well, ain't this nice? I was wondering how I was gonna get you back, and here you deliver yourself.<br> Who's your friend with the ears, Kirk? I think you've got it reversed, Mr.<br> Krako.<br> I ain't, pally.<br> Put down your heaters.<br> Captain, I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says.<br> I just heard the sound of The sound of a machine-gun bolt being pulled back.<br> Mr.<br> Krako, I don't So this is the fancy heater, huh? - How does it work? - I'm trying to tell you, Mr.<br> Krako, that this is bigger than you, Oxmyx or anyone.<br> The only thing I want you to tell me is how it works.<br> Well, can you trust all your men? Of course I can.<br> Well, one of these could make a man a pretty big boss, you know.<br> I either trust them or they're dead.<br> Let's go in here and talk about it.<br> Now we got no busy little eyes to worry about.<br> How does this work? All right, Krako, we don't have time to show you how to play with toys.<br> Toys? What do you think we're here for, to get a cut of your deal? Forget it.<br> That's peanuts to an outfit like the Federation, right? Unquestionably.<br> - Right? - Right.<br> Now, look, Krako, we're taking over the whole ball of wax.<br> And you cooperate with us, and maybe we'll cut you in for a piece of the action.<br> A minuscule A very small piece.<br> - How much is that? - That's We'll figure it out later.<br> I thought you guys had laws.<br> No interference.<br> Who's interfering? We're taking over.<br> - Check? - Right.<br> The planet is being taken over by the Federation, but we don't wanna come in here and use our muscle.<br> You know what I mean? That ain't subtle.<br> So, what we do is we We help one guy take over the planet.<br> He pulls the strings, and then we pull his.<br> Hey, you, sit down.<br> - What's your cut? - What do you care, as long as you're being cut in? Of course, there's always Bela Oxmyx.<br> All right, it's a deal.<br> Call your ship, bring down your boys and whatever else you need.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise.<br> Scott here.<br> All right, Scotty, we made a deal with Krako.<br> - We did, sir? - Yeah, we're ready to make the hit.<br> We're taking over the whole planet as soon as you get ready.<br> Do you think that's wise, sir? Sure, we can trust Krako, but we don't have any choice.<br> You know what I mean? He's standing about 12 feet in front of me, all ready to be our pal.<br> Of course, Scotty, I'd like to show him the ship, just to show him that we're We're on the level, but you know how it is.<br> Aye.<br> I know, indeed.<br> Scotty, we'll need phasers to equip every one of Krako's men.<br> We'll need advisors and troops to back him up on the hit.<br> - You got all that, Scotty? - Aye, captain.<br> Captain, we're preparing everything.<br> It'll be ready when you give the word.<br> You may begin, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Acknowledged, captain.<br> You mean you're gonna start sending down your boys now? Not exactly.<br> - Right? - Check.<br> How.<br>.<br>? How'd I get here? What.<br>.<br>? What happened? You, you must be that Scott fellow that Kirk was talking to.<br> I wanna know what happened! It looks like we put the bag on you, doesn't it? - I got rights! - You got nothing.<br> You mind your place, mister, or you'll You'll be wearing concrete galoshes.<br> You mean cement overshoes? Aye.<br> - Must we? - It's faster than walking.<br> - But not as safe.<br> - Are you afraid of cars? Not at all, captain.<br> It's your driving that alarms me.<br> Spock, I've got the hang of it by now.<br> Go on.<br> Oh, not again.<br> Hey, wake up.<br> You all right? Hey, you guys, come in here! The Feds snatched Krako.<br> I never seen anything like it.<br> They're gonna move in unless we stop them now.<br> Yeah? How? Bela's mixed up in this somehow.<br> I got a sneaking hunch they're gonna hightail it back to his territory.<br> And you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna hit his place.<br> Where are they? Knowing Krako, he'll probably send them back on a blotter.<br> Wrong again, Oxmyx.<br> - Jim.<br> - Knock it off, Sawbones.<br> I wanna talk to this creep.<br> Now, listen, I'm getting tired of playing patty cake with you penny-ante operators.<br> What do you mean, a penny-ante operator? You're a penny-ante operator.<br> Sit down.<br> All right, Spocko, cover him.<br> Listen, sweetheart, the Federation's moving in.<br> We're taking over.<br> You play ball, we'll cut you in for a piece.<br> If you don't, you're out.<br> All the way out.<br> Do you know what I mean? Yeah.<br> Sure.<br> Why didn't you say so in the first place? All you had to do was explain it to me.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise.<br> Scott here, sir.<br> - You got Krako on ice? - Aye, he's here.<br> Mad enough to chew neutronium, but behaving himself.<br> Okay, baby, cool him until I flag you.<br> Flag me? Keep him there until I send for him.<br> We're gonna make some old-style phone calls from this locale, so you locate the man on the other end of the blower - and give him a ride to his flop.<br> - What? Find the man at the other end of the phone, and transport him to these coordinates.<br> Can do, sweetheart? Can do, captain.<br> - Standing by.<br> - Now, you.<br> Get on the blower and call the other bosses.<br> I sure don't know what you think you're talking about.<br> Get with it.<br> I'm giving the orders here.<br> Hello.<br> Hello? - Scotty.<br> - Scott here.<br> - Guess who.<br> - Lock in and energize.<br> Yeah, you bet your life I've got a lot of nerve.<br> What are you gonna do about it? I'm coming over there with a couple of my boys and we Mother - Hey, captain, that ain't bad.<br> - Yeah.<br> I would advise youse to keep dialling, Oxmyx.<br> All right, you know what to do.<br> We hit Bela's place and nobody comes out alive.<br> All right, let's go! All right.<br> All right.<br> All right! All right! Now, the Federation's taking over whether you like it or not.<br> You people, you've been running this planet like a piecework factory.<br> From now on, it's gonna be under one roof.<br> You're gonna run it like a Like a business.<br> And that means, you're gonna make a profit.<br> Yeah.<br> And what's your percentage? I'm cutting the Federation in for 40 percent.<br> - You got any objections? - Yeah.<br> I hear a lot of talk, but all I see here is you and a couple of your boys.<br> I don't see no Federation.<br> Listen, they got a ship.<br> I know, I was there.<br> Wait a minute.<br> Wait a minute.<br> - Tepo's got a point.<br> All we see is them.<br> - Right.<br> What? Couple of your boys? I'm not gonna believe my eyes Hang on a minute, hang on a minute.<br> Quiet! Just a moment.<br> Let me say something.<br> I only saw three guys on that ship.<br> Maybe there ain't no more.<br> There are over 400 guys there.<br> That's your story, buster.<br> Hey, that's my boys, they're making a hit on this place.<br> - My boys will put you down.<br> - Wanna bet? Keep moving.<br> One move out of you two guys and I'll drill him.<br> Give me the hardware.<br> Hey, that's great, Krako.<br> Now we got hostages again.<br> We can make a deal with the Feds.<br> Are you kidding? This one's all mine.<br> From now on, nobody's going no place.<br> I'm gonna be the big boss in this here territory.<br> Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.<br> Get that heater down.<br> Don't you wanna take a look at what you're gonna fight? I already seen it.<br> You're nothing, Fed.<br> All right, but at least let me call my ship one last time - and say goodbye.<br> - Well, all right.<br> Go ahead.<br> Don't get smart.<br> Hello, Scotty, this is Kirk.<br> Enterprise.<br> Scott here, sir.<br> Scotty, put the ship's phasers on stun.<br> Fire out bursts in a one-block radius around these coordinates.<br> Right away, sir.<br> Scott out.<br> Gee, that's some trick.<br> - Hey, did you see that? - They're not dead, just knocked out for a while.<br> But they might just as well have been that way if we wanted them to.<br> Okay, okay, Kirk.<br> So we get the message.<br> Now, what was this syndicate deal you were talking about? He He was talking about a percentage.<br> - I was talking about both.<br> - Okay.<br> A syndicate makes sense to me.<br> I'm a peaceful man at heart, but I'm sick and tired of all these hits.<br> I hit Krako.<br> Krako hits Tepo.<br> Tepo hits me.<br> There's too many bosses.<br> We can't get anything done.<br> I was thinking, if there was just one, maybe somebody like you as the top boss, then we can get things done.<br> Hey, Bela.<br> No, no, no.<br> The Federation can't get connected with a small-time operation like this.<br> No, I was thinking, Bela, you would be the top boss.<br> Krako, you'd be his lieutenant.<br> I don't want any trouble from the rest of you, because you'll have to answer to the Federation.<br> We'll be back every year to collect our cut.<br> Hey, look, you figure maybe 40 percent's enough? Yeah, I think 40 percent's sufficient.<br> It's reasonable.<br> It sounds reasonable.<br> That sound reasonable to you? It's reasonable, Mr.<br> Oxmyx.<br> Let's break out some of your drinking stuff and celebrate the syndicate.<br> Gentlemen, you two have been brooding - ever since we returned to the ship.<br> - Brooding, captain? Brooding, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A sombre emotional state.<br> Now, do you wish to continue it or are you going to discuss it? Captain, I am neither brooding nor sombre.<br> But I do have reservations about your solution to the problem of the lotians.<br> Yes.<br> I understand that.<br> You don't think it's logical to leave a criminal organisation in charge.<br> Highly irregular, to say the least, captain.<br> I'm also curious as to how you propose to explain to Starfleet Command that a starship will be sent each year to collect our cut.<br> Yes, that's a very good question, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I propose that our cut be put into the planetary treasury and used to guide the lotians into a more ethical system.<br> Despite themselves, they'll be forced to accept conventional responsibilities.<br> Isn't that logical? All right, Bones, in the language of the planet, what's your beef? Well, I don't know how serious this is, Jim, and I don't quite know how to tell you.<br> Well, go ahead.<br> - But in all the confusion, l - Go ahead, tell me.<br> - I think I left it in Bela's office.<br> - You left it? Somewhere.<br> I'm not certain.<br> You're not certain of what? - I left my communicator.<br> - In Bela's office? Captain, if the lotians, who are very bright and imitative people, - should take the communicator apart - They will.<br> They'll find out how the transtator works.<br> The transtator is the basis for every important piece of equipment - that we have.<br> - Do you think it's that serious? Serious? Serious, Bones? It upsets the whole percentage.<br> How do you mean? Well, in a few years, the lotians may demand a piece of our action.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

You're in pain? Captain, the Intrepid, it just died.<br> And the 400 Vulcans aboard, all dead.<br> Come on, Spock, let's go down to Sickbay.<br> - Doctor, I know what I know.<br> - Get to the Sickbay.<br> - Captain - No, no, no.<br> That's an order.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain, I have Starbase 6 readable now.<br> Switching to audio, sir.<br> Kirk here.<br> Go ahead.<br> You will divert immediately to Sector 3-9-J.<br> Sir, the Enterprise just completed an exhausting mission.<br> We're on our way in for R and R.<br> Must be another starship in that sector.<br> Negative.<br> This is a rescue priority.<br> We've lost all contact with solar system Gamma 7A, which the Intrepid was investigating.<br> And we've just lost contact with the Intrepid.<br> Report progress.<br> Order acknowledged.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Kyle, you heard the order.<br> Set a course for Gamma 7A.<br> - Warp 5.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain, I have just completed a full long-range scan of Gamma 7A system.<br> - It is dead.<br> - Dead? That was a fourth-magnitude sun.<br> There are billions of inhabitants there.<br> It is dead.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> I assure you, doctor, I'm quite all right.<br> The pain was momentary.<br> It passed quickly.<br> Well, all of my instruments seem to agree with you, if I can trust these crazy Vulcan readings.<br> Spock, how can you be so sure the Intrepid was destroyed? - I sensed it die.<br> - But I thought you had to be in physical contact with the subject before Doctor, even I, a half-Vulcan, could hear the death scream of 400 Vulcan minds crying out over the distance between us.<br> Not even a Vulcan could feel a starship die.<br> Call it a deep understanding of the way things happen to Vulcans, but I know that not a person, not even the computers onboard the Intrepid, knew what was killing them or would have understood it had they known.<br> But 400 Vulcans.<br> I've noticed that about your people, doctor.<br> You find it easier to understand the death of one than the death of a million.<br> You speak about the objective hardness of the Vulcan heart, yet how little room there seems to be in yours.<br> Suffer the deaths of thy neighbour, eh, Spock? You wouldn't wish that on us, would you? It might have rendered your history a bit less bloody.<br> Spock, you may have been right.<br> We've lost contact with the Intrepid and are out of communication with an entire solar system.<br> Any update from Starfleet? I cannot filter out the distortion, sir.<br> It's getting worse.<br> Captain, deflector shields just snapped on.<br> - Slow to warp 3.<br> - Warp 3, sir.<br> Indications of energy turbulence ahead.<br> Unable to analyse.<br> I've never encountered readings like this before.<br> Scanners on.<br> - Magnification 3 on the screen.<br> - Magnification factor 3, sir.<br> Exactly what are we looking for, Mr.<br> Spock? I would assume, that.<br> What is that? Perhaps an interstellar dust cloud? Not very likely, ensign.<br> No.<br> You'd be able to see stars through a dust cloud.<br> It looks like a hole in space.<br> - Readings, Mr.<br> Spock? - Still not able to analyse, captain.<br> Sensors are feeding data to the computers now.<br> Whatever this dark zone is, it lies directly in line with the course I calculate for the Intrepid and the Gamma 7A system.<br> Hold present course.<br> Slow to warp 1.<br> Warp factor 1, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, prepare to launch telemetry probe into that zone.<br> - Direct computer feed to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Probe ready.<br> Switching data feed to library computer.<br> - Launch probe.<br> - Probe launched, sir.<br> - What was that? - The telemetry probe, sir.<br> There's no signal from it now.<br> - Speculation, Spock? - I have none, captain.<br> Insufficient data.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Just dizzy.<br> I'll be all right.<br> I'm fine, sir.<br> Sickbay to Captain Kirk.<br> McCoy here.<br> - Kirk here.<br> What is it? - I'm getting reports from every deck.<br> Half the people on this ship just fainted.<br> Uhura almost did.<br> She says she's all right.<br> Do you wanna see her? Not unless she's feeling ill.<br> I've got an emergency down here.<br> - What's wrong? - Well, it's nothing organic.<br> They all seem to be nervous, weak and irritable.<br> They say it happened suddenly, like a balloon popping.<br> Can you handle it, Bones? I'm giving them stimulants to keep them on their feet.<br> - Yeah, we can handle it, Jim.<br> - Good.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Hold our position, Mr.<br> Kyle.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Spock, give me an update on the dark area ahead.<br> No analysis due to insufficient information.<br> No speculation, no information, nothing.<br> I've asked three times for information and you've been unable to supply it.<br> \"Insufficient data\" is not sufficient, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You're the science officer.<br> You're to have sufficient data all the time.<br> I am well aware of that, captain, but the computers contain nothing on this phenomenon.<br> It is beyond our experience, and the new information is not yet significant.<br> I don't know about you, but I'm tired.<br> If you can't tell me what it is, let's use reverse logic.<br> Perhaps it'll help if you tell me what it isn't.<br> It is not liquid, gaseous or solid, despite the fact we cannot see through it.<br> So far, that's not much help.<br> It is not a galactic nebula, such as the Coalsack.<br> And since our deflectors were activated by it, it would seem to be some form of energy, but nothing our sensors can identify.<br> Is it possible that this is what killed that solar system - and the Intrepid? - Very possible.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Notify the Starfleet that we're going to attempt to probe the area of darkness - to gain further information.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Captain - No, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Distance from zone of darkness, Mr.<br> Kyle? One hundred thousand kilometres, sir.<br> All right.<br> Ahead slow.<br> Impulse power only.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Transmission to Starfleet complete, sir.<br> Very good.<br> Time, Mr.<br> Chekov? Penetration of the zone in one minute, seven seconds, sir.<br> Red alert.<br> Deflectors, full power.<br> Phaser banks ready? Phasers standing by, deflectors are at full power, sir.<br> It's not coming from communications, sir.<br> - Spock? - Analysing now, captain.<br> Captain, the stars are gone.<br> - Malfunction, Mr.<br> Spock? - Negative, captain.<br> All systems functioning properly.<br> Then kindly tell me what happened to the stars.<br> Unknown, captain.<br> - Kirk to McCoy.<br> - McCoy here.<br> - Things any better down there? - Worse.<br> They're backed up into the corridor.<br> Well, have you got anything that'll help up here? I don't want anybody folding on the Bridge at a critical moment.<br> On my way.<br> McCoy out.<br> Kirk to Engineering.<br> Scotty, there was a power loss.<br> How come? We lost 5 percent of our energy reserves, sir.<br> Our deflector shields are weakened.<br> - Can you compensate for the loss? - Aye, if we don't lose any more.<br> Don't ask me how it happened.<br> I am asking how, mister.<br> I want answers.<br> Kirk out.<br> - What's that? - A stimulant.<br> Bones, how bad is it? Two-thirds of the personnel are affected.<br> Why? How? Do you have any answers? You'll get everything I can tell you, but when there is nothing, what do you want me to say? Bones.<br> Nurse.<br> This ship is in trouble.<br> We better start solving problems faster than we pick up new ones.<br> We seem to be in the middle of a creeping paralysis.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, analysis of that last burst of noise, before we started losing power.<br> That sound was the turbulence caused by the penetration of a boundary layer.<br> - What boundary layer? - Unknown.<br> A boundary layer between what and what? Between where we were and where we are.<br> Are you trying to be funny, Mr.<br> Spock? It would never occur to me, captain.<br> Do you have any ideas, Spock? We still have no specifics, but we seem to have entered a zone of energy which is incompatible with our living and mechanical processes.<br> As we draw closer to the source, it grows stronger and we grow weaker.<br> - Recommendations? - I have one.<br> I recommend survival.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> This is the captain.<br> We're on a difficult mission, but it's not the first time.<br> Our orders do not say stay alive or retreat.<br> Our mission is to investigate.<br> We're sick and we're getting sicker.<br> We have no guarantees, but we have a good ship and the best crew in Starfleet.<br> So do your jobs.<br> Carry on.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Sickbay to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Go ahead, Bones.<br> Jim, according to the life indicators, the energy levels Yeah, say it, Bones.<br> According to the life monitors, we're dying.<br> We're all dying.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4308.<br>8.<br> It is now ten minutes since we entered the zone of darkness.<br> We have stopped engines while we seek a defence against the energy drain which seems to pervade the zone.<br> - You all right? What was that? - I'm sorry, sir.<br> I'm not sure.<br> I was trying to recalibrate and we went into reverse.<br> Reverse? But that was a forward lurch.<br> How could that happen in reverse thrust? I don't know, sir.<br> All I know is that the power levels are down I've never experienced anything like it.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Sir, we are accelerating.<br> We are being pulled toward the centre of the zone of darkness.<br> - By what, Spock? - Unknown, captain.<br> I suggest you order Mr.<br> Scott to give us reverse power.<br> He just gave us reverse power.<br> We lurched forward.<br> In that case, captain, I would suggest we apply forward thrust.<br> Doctor, life-function indicators, they've started a sharp drop again.<br> Stimulants.<br> I don't know how long we can keep this up.<br> What do you think, Scotty? Forward thrust? I don't know, sir.<br> It goes against the rules of logic.<br> Yes, it does, doesn't it? Well, if it doesn't work, I'll never let Spock live it down.<br> Nudge it into forward.<br> - But, s - Go ahead.<br> That's doing it, sir.<br> We're slowing down.<br> But we're not stopping.<br> We're still being dragged forward.<br> Have one of your engineers monitor the instruments.<br> Keep applying thrust against the pull.<br> Doctor, they seem to be stabilising.<br> But at a dangerously low level.<br> Well, we're still alive.<br> I suppose that's something.<br> All I can contribute is the further we travel into this zone of darkness, the weaker our life functions become and I have no idea why.<br> I'm all right.<br> It's those stimulants.<br> They catch up with you.<br> Engineering? As far as power levels are concerned, everything is acting backwards.<br> But the drain is continuing.<br> On the static tests, I could only get 60 percent power.<br> - We're still being dragged forward.<br> - Spock? It is logical to assume that something within this zone absorbs all forms of energy, whether mechanically or biologically produced.<br> Whatever it is, it would seem to be the same thing which drew all the energy out of an entire solar system and the Intrepid.<br> - The same thing, not the zone itself? - I would say not, captain.<br> The analysis of the zone indicates it is a negative energy field, however illogical that may sound.<br> But it is not the source of the power drain.<br> Maybe it's a shield of some kind, some form of protection for something else.<br> - But what? - We'll find out what it is, but we better get out of here ourselves.<br> Scotty, channel all the impulse and warp power into one massive thrust forward.<br> That might snap us out of the zone.<br> Aye, captain.<br> But I'll reserve some for the shields in case we don't get out.<br> I submit, Mr.<br> Scott, that if we do not get out, the shields would be extraneous.<br> It would only prolong our wait for death by a short period of time.<br> Use whatever power is necessary to get us out of here, Scotty.<br> Report to your stations, continue your research.<br> Dismissed.<br> Captain, the Intrepid would have done all these things too, and yet they were destroyed.<br> Well, they may not have done all these things.<br> You've just pointed out how illogical this situation is.<br> True.<br> It is also true they never knew what was killing them.<br> Their logic would not have permitted them to believe they were being killed.<br> Explain.<br> Vulcan has not been conquered within its collective memory.<br> The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror.<br> I knew the ship was lost because I sensed it.<br> - What was it you sensed? - A touch of death.<br> And what do you think they felt? Astonishment.<br> That ought to do it.<br> Engineering to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> What is it, Scotty? - Ready to try it when you are, sir.<br> Do we have the power to pull it off, Scotty? - I hope so, captain.<br> - Stand by.<br> All hands, this is the captain.<br> We are slowly being pulled deeper into the zone of darkness by an unknown force.<br> We're going to apply all available power into one giant forward thrust, in the hope that it will yank us out of the zone.<br> Prepare yourselves.<br> All right, Scotty.<br> Let's get on with it.<br> - Scotty! - It's no good, sir.<br> The best we can do is to maintain thrust against the pull and hold our position.<br> - Are we still losing power? - Aye, sir.<br> How long will the power hold out? At this rate, plus the drain on all systems, two hours, sir.<br> Maintain thrust, Scotty.<br> While we're maintaining our distance, Mr.<br> Spock, have you ascertained yet what we're maintaining our distance from? I cannot say what it is, captain.<br> But I would say it has found us.<br> - Prepare to launch a probe, Chekov.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Probe ready for launch, sir.<br> Getting very confused readings, captain, but this is definitely the source of the energy drain.<br> - Launch probe.<br> - Probe launched, sir.<br> Probe will impact in 7.<br>3 seconds.<br> Six, five, four, three, two, one - Are we still in contact with the probe? - Yes, sir.<br> - Data being relayed to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Readings coming in now, captain.<br> Length: Approximately 11,000 miles.<br> Width: Varying from 2,000 to 3,000 miles.<br> Outer layer studded with space debris and waste.<br> Interior consists of protoplasm.<br> Varying from a firmer gelatinous layer to a semi-fluid central mass.<br> Condition: Living.<br> - Magnification 4.<br> - Magnification 4, sir.<br> That is what is drawing us toward it, captain.<br> The same way it drew the Intrepid to her death.<br> That is an amoeba.<br> Yes, I remember my basic biology, doctor.<br> Do you mean to tell me that thing out there is a giant, single-celled animal? Yes, for lack of a better term.<br> It's a very simple form of life.<br> In fact, it's a much simpler form of life than what you're looking at now.<br> But that thing out there apparently can perform all the functions that qualify it as a living organism.<br> It can reproduce, it can breathe, it can eat, although I don't know what.<br> Energy itself, perhaps, drained from us.<br> I would speculate that this unknown life form is invading our galaxy like a virus.<br> The Intrepid died of that particular virus.<br> How is it we survive? The Intrepid must have come across the organism while it was still low in energy, still hungry.<br> We are not safe, captain.<br> We merely have a little more time than the Intrepid did.<br> What about this zone of darkness? Does the organism generate it itself as a form of protection? That's one of the things we've got to find out.<br> We've got to take a closer look at it.<br> The closer we get, the faster our energy drains out.<br> We're barely surviving at this distance.<br> Perhaps we could risk the shuttlecraft.<br> - Perhaps with a protective shield - I'm not sending anyone anywhere.<br> Unmanned probes can give us the information we need to destroy this thing, if it can be destroyed.<br> I must differ with you, captain.<br> We have sent unmanned probes into it.<br> They have given us some information, but they have not told us what we need to know.<br> And we cannot afford the power to take blind shots at it, hoping to kill it.<br> We could send one man in, pinpoint its vulnerable spots.<br> Do you know what the odds are in coming back? I can't order a man to do that.<br> Who said anything about an order, Jim? You've got a volunteer.<br> I've already done the preliminary work.<br> - It's a suicide mission, Bones.<br> - The thing evidently has reflexes.<br> The unmanned probe we sent into it must have stung it when it entered.<br> The lurch we felt was the turbulence of its reaction.<br> All right, so I'd know enough to go slow when we penetrated its vulnerable spots.<br> You have a martyr complex, doctor.<br> I submit that it disqualifies you.<br> Do you think that I intend to pass up the greatest living laboratory since.<br>.<br>? The Vulcans saw it first, and died.<br> - Just because the Vulcans failed - I am more capable.<br> Gentlemen, I am not taking volunteers.<br> You don't think you're going? I'm better qualified as a command pilot than you are.<br> Which makes you indispensable, captain.<br> Further, you are not a science specialist.<br> Jim, that organism contains chemical processes we've never seen before and may never see again.<br> - We could learn more in one day - We don't have one day, doctor.<br> We have precisely one hour and 35 minutes of power left.<br> - Jim.<br> - Captain, l Gentlemen, I'll decide.<br> Captain's personal log, stardate 4309.<br>2.<br> We have established that the thing which destroyed the USS Intrepid and the Gamma 7A system is an incredibly huge but simple cellular being whose energies are totally destructive to all known life.<br> Both Mr.<br> Spock and Dr.<br> McCoy have volunteered to go in a specially equipped shuttlecraft, penetrate the cell, find a way to destroy it and free the ship.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has the medical-biological knowledge.<br> Mr.<br> Spock is better suited physically and emotionally to stand the stress.<br> Both are right, both are capable.<br> And which of my friends do I condemn to death? This is the captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, Dr.<br> McCoy, report to my quarters immediately.<br> Kirk out.<br> - Engineering to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> You asked me to keep you informed on the power drain, sir.<br> All levels are down 50 percent now and still draining.<br> We can maintain thrust for another hour and 15 minutes.<br> Very well.<br> - Prepare the shuttlecraft for launching.<br> - Sir? Dr.<br> McCoy will tell you what special equipment to put in it.<br> Kirk out.<br> I'm sorry, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Right.<br> I'll get a few things I need, Jim.<br> - Not you, Bones.<br> I'm sorry, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You're best qualified to go.<br> Do not suffer so, doctor.<br> This is not the first time superior capability has proven more valuable than professional credentials.<br> Nothing has been proven yet, Spock.<br> The DNA code analyser will give you the fundamental structure of the thing.<br> You'll need readings on three light wavelengths from the enzyme recorder.<br> I am familiar with the equipment, doctor.<br> We're wasting time.<br> The shuttlecraft is ready.<br> You're determined not to let me share in this, aren't you? This is not a competition, doctor.<br> Whether you understand it or not, grant me my own kind of dignity.<br> Vulcan dignity? How can I grant you what I don't understand? Then employ one of your own superstitions.<br> Wish me luck.<br> Good luck, Spock.<br> All systems clear for shuttlecraft launch, sir.<br> - Launch shuttlecraft.<br> - Shuttlecraft away, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, channel automatic telemetry directly to the computers.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.<br> Come in, Spock.<br> Power drain is enormous and growing worse.<br> Chekov.<br> Diverting all secondary power to the shields.<br> - Continue communications as long as there is power to transmit.<br> Captain, he won't have enough power to get back out if he diverts it to his shields.<br> - Spock.<br> - I heard, captain.<br> We discussed that possibility earlier.<br> But you will need this information.<br> When do you estimate penetration? Slowing now.<br> Contact in 18.<br>3 seconds.<br> Brace yourselves.<br> The area of penetration will no doubt be sensitive.<br> Contact in six seconds.<br> Report, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Spock, report.<br> - I am undamaged, captain.<br> Relay to Mr.<br> Scott, I had 3 percent power reserve before the shields stabilised.<br> There was nothing to spare.<br> I shall continue my tests.<br> Oh, and Dr.<br> McCoy you would not have survived it.<br> - You wanna bet? I am moving slowly now.<br> Establishing course toward what appears to be the nucleus.<br> Sir, Mr.<br> Spock has reduced life-support systems to bare minimum.<br> Spock, save your power for the shields.<br> Calculations indicate the shields will last only 47 minutes.<br> However, I am able to identify the chromosome structure.<br> Changes indicate the organism has stored sufficient energy for reproductive process to commence.<br> Will there be two of those things? I am having difficulty maintaining the ship control.<br> Spock, do you read me? Spock, do you read me? I am losing voice contact.<br> I will transmit internal coordinates of chromosome bodies.<br> Spock, come in.<br> Come in! Contact lost, sir.<br> He's alive! He's kicked it in the side to let us know.<br> Captain, I'm getting telemetry.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, telemetry analysis as it comes in.<br> According to Spock's telemetry information, there are over 40 chromosomes in the nucleus that are ready to come together, ready to reproduce.<br> If the energy of that organism only doubles, we're dead, and everything within a light year will be defenceless.<br> Well, all I know is that soon there will be two, four, eight more.<br> The entire anti-life matter that that thing puts out could someday encompass the entire galaxy.<br> Spock understood when he transmitted the coordinates of the chromosomes.<br> - We must destroy that organism.<br> - Captain, the pull from that organism is increasing.<br> And the power drain from our shields is getting critical.<br> - How much time do we have? - No more than an hour now, sir.<br> Put all secondary systems on standby.<br> Shield power has unconditional priority.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Captain, I'm receiving a message from Mr.<br> Spock on a low-energy channel.<br> It's faint but it is readable.<br> Put it on, lieutenant.<br> - On audio, sir.<br> - This is Spock.<br> I am slowly losing life support and minimal shield energies.<br> According to my calculations, the nervous energy of the organism is maximal just within its outer protective membrane.<br> Relatively insensitive to interior irritation.<br> Believe a sufficient charge of - could destroy the organism.<br> Tell Dr.<br> McCoy he should have wished me luck.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4309.<br>4.<br> We have determined we can destroy the creature, provided we can do it from inside the organism.<br> Spock clearly knew how to destroy it, but was unable to transmit that information.<br> How do you feel? - What's on your mind? - Spock.<br> Is it me, Jim, or am I so sentimental that I just have to keep believing that he's still alive out there in that mass of protoplasm? He knew the odds when he went there just as you did when you volunteered.<br> What is that thing out there, Bones? It's not intelligent.<br> Not yet.<br> It's a disease.<br> Like a virus, invading the body of our galaxy.<br> Yes, it is, isn't it? How many cells does a human body have? - Millions.<br> - This thing, this cell, this virus, it's 11,000 miles long.<br> And it's one cell.<br> When it grows into millions, we'll be the virus invading its body.<br> Now, isn't that a thought? Here we are, antibodies of our own galaxy, attacking an invading germ.<br> It'd be ironic, indeed, if that were our sole destiny, wouldn't it? Antibodies.<br> Antibodies.<br> - Bridge.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> - How much power do we have left? - We're down to 43 percent, sir.<br> We're slipping a bit against the pull that beastie's putting on us.<br> We can't last more than 45 minutes at this rate of decline.<br> Less, if I have to apply more thrust.<br> What would happen if you diverted all remaining power to the shields? Except for impulse power.<br> Keep that in reserve.<br> Cut the engine thrust? We'd be sucked into that thing like being caught in a wind tunnel, sir.<br> Exactly.<br> Prepare to divert power on my signal.<br> Kirk out.<br> Have you got something to say? Technically, no.<br> Medically, yes.<br> Between the stimulants and the pressure, I would suggest you try to stay off your feet for a few minutes.<br> I don't have a few minutes, Bones.<br> Maybe none of us do.<br> Let's go.<br> All hands, this is the captain.<br> We are going to enter the body of the organism rather abruptly, I would think.<br> Damage-control parties, stand by.<br> All decks, secure for collision.<br> Kirk out.<br> Ready, Scotty.<br> Switching power to shields, impulse in reserve, cutting thrust to zero now.<br> Impact, five seconds.<br> We're through, sir.<br> I believe everybody is aware of that, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Damage-control parties report minimal damage, sir.<br> - Repairs are being initiated.<br> - Very good, lieutenant.<br> Captain, we've only 26 percent power reserves after entry.<br> - Do we have impulse power, Scotty? - I saved all I could, sir, but I don't know if we have enough to get back out, or time either.<br> - We are committed.<br> - Aye, we are.<br> But we're committed to what? We have no power for the phasers.<br> We couldn't use it if we had it.<br> We'd cook ourselves along with that massive protoplasm out there.<br> That thing would probably like phasers.<br> It eats power.<br> Well, then what the devil Begging your pardon, sir.<br> - Are we doing? I think Mr.<br> Spock was trying to tell us what to do when we lost voice contact.<br> - But we can't use power to destroy it.<br> - Anti-power.<br> - What? - It has a negative energy charge.<br> Everything seems to work in reverse.<br> - We'll use antimatter.<br> - Aye.<br> It couldn't swallow that.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, prepare a probe.<br> Scotty, we need a magnetic bottle for the charge.<br> - How soon? - It's on its way, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, we'll use a timing detonator for the probe.<br> - We'll work out a setting.<br> - Aye.<br> Helmsman, when do you estimate arrival on nucleus? Seven minutes, sir.<br> - How close are you going to it? - Point-blank range.<br> - We'll implant it, then back away.<br> - Why? The probe has a range of With the eddies and currents in that protoplasm, the probe could drift thousands of kilometres.<br> We must be exactly on target because we won't have a second chance.<br> Bones.<br> Time for another stimulant.<br> How long do you think you can keep taking that stuff? It'll blow you apart.<br> Keep me together for another seven minutes.<br> That's all I need.<br> Personal log, Commander Spock, USS Enterprise.<br> I have noted the passage of the Enterprise on its way to whatever awaits it.<br> If this record should survive me, I wish it known that I bequeath my highest commendation and testimonial to the captain, officers and crew of the Enterprise, the finest starship in the fleet.<br> We have arrived at the chromosome body in the nucleus of the organism.<br> If we should fail in our attempt to destroy it or be unable to free ourselves, I wish to record my recommendations for the following personnel that they receive special citation: Lieutenant Commander Leonard McCoy, Lieutenant Commander Montgomery Scott, Officers Chekov, Kyle, Uhura.<br> And my highest commendation for Commander Spock, science officer, who gave his life in the performance of his duty.<br> Target coordinates programmed, sir.<br> Probe ready for launch.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, how much time do we have left at 100 percent impulse power? Six, maybe seven minutes, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Kyle, programme fuse for seven-minute delay.<br> All nonessential systems on standby.<br> Communications, scanning.<br> Conserve every bit of power.<br> We must make it through the membrane before that thing explodes.<br> - Make it work, Scotty.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Programming complete.<br> - Ready for launch.<br> - Launch probe at zero acceleration.<br> Forward thrust off, one tenth of a second.<br> Forward thrust off, sir.<br> Probe launched, sir.<br> Despite what Spock said, it's still plenty sensitive.<br> Probe confirmed.<br> It is lodged in the nucleus, near the chromosome bodies.<br> Mr.<br> Kyle, back us out the way we came in.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, a nice straight line.<br> - Don't waste any time.<br> - Backing out, sir.<br> I estimate we will be out in 6.<br>37 minutes.<br> Very good.<br> Captain, metallic substance outside the ship.<br> Spock? Lieutenant, get me Spock's voice channel.<br> Highest possible gain.<br> - Go ahead, sir.<br> - Spock, do you read me? Do you read me, Spock? Do you read me? Come in, Spock.<br> Spock! Scotty, get a tractor beam.<br> We don't have enough time.<br> We only have a 53-second escape margin.<br> I'm well aware of that, Scott.<br> Get two tractor beams on that shuttlecraft.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Tractor beams on.<br> Captain, I recommend you abandon the attempt.<br> Do not risk the ship further on my behalf.<br> Shut up, Spock! We're rescuing you.<br> Why, thank you, Captain McCoy.<br> Almost out.<br> - We're approaching the membrane.<br> - Time until explosion? Fifty-seven seconds, sir.<br> Maintaining tractor beams on the shuttlecraft, Mr.<br> Scott? Aye, sir.<br> But I can't guarantee it'll hold when the warhead explodes.<br> The power levels are Power levels are dead, sir.<br> You may have just written our epitaph, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Activate main viewing screen.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, report.<br> The organism is destroyed, sir.<br> The explosion must have ruptured the membrane and thrown us clear.<br> Power is coming back, sir.<br> The shuttlecraft? I don't know how, sir, but it's still with us.<br> Shuttlecraft to Enterprise.<br> Shuttlecraft to Enterprise, request permission to come aboard.<br> Spock, you're alive! Obviously, captain.<br> And I have some fascinating data on the organism.<br> Don't be so smart, Spock.<br> You botched the acetylcholine test.<br> Later, later, later.<br> - Bring the shuttlecraft aboard, Scott.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Prepare to receive shuttlecraft.<br> Received shuttlecraft.<br> Hangar doors closed.<br> Hangar deck pressurising.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, lay in a course for Starbase 6, ahead warp factor 5.<br> I'm still looking forward to a nice period of rest and relaxation on some lovely planet.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

When I left there 13 years ago, those villagers had barely learned to forge iron.<br> Spock was shot with a flintlock.<br> How many centuries between those two developments? On Earth, about 12, sir.<br> On the other hand, a flintlock would be the first firearm the inhabitants would normally develop.<br> Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> And, sir, the fact Earth took We've seen development at different rates on different planets.<br> And if it were the Klingons behind it, why not give them breechloaders? - Or machine guns? - Or old-style hand I did not invite a debate.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm worried about Spock and concerned about what's happened to something I once knew down there.<br> You have the Conn, Scotty.<br> I'll be at Sickbay.<br> We've no replacements for the damaged organs, sir.<br> If he's going to live, his Vulcan physiology will have to do it for him.<br> Agreed.<br> - Sterilite off.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> He'll live or die now, Jim.<br> I don't know which.<br> Dr.<br> M'Benga interned in a Vulcan ward.<br> He couldn't be in better hands.<br> Then you and I are transporting down, Bones.<br> - I can't leave Spock at this time.<br> - You just indicated you could.<br> There are Klingons here.<br> If their mission is a legitimate research interest in the planet's organic potential, then you're the one man who can tell me.<br> - And if that's not it? - Then I need help.<br> Advice I can trust as much as Spock's.<br> I appreciate the compliment but Bones, I'm as worried about Spock as you are.<br> But if the Klingons are breaking the treaty it could be interstellar war.<br> - Kirk to Bridge.<br> - Bridge, Scott here.<br> McCoy and I are transporting back down.<br> Inform ship's stores that we'll need native costumes.<br> Captain, we may have to break out of orbit any minute to keep out of their sight.<br> We'd be out of communicator range with you.<br> I understand.<br> We'll arrange a rendezvous schedule.<br> Kirk out.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4211.<br>4.<br> Keeping our presence here secret is an enormous tactical advantage.<br> Therefore, I cannot risk contact with Starfleet Command.<br> I must take action on my own judgement.<br> I have elected to violate orders and make contact with planet inhabitants here.<br> Perfect.<br> Tyree's camp's a quarter mile away.<br> Wanna think about it again, Jim?

Yes, but the mugatos travel at night also.<br> You killed one.<br> Its mate will not be far.<br> - You've seen how these work? - I've seen them also.<br> And I know you have many ways to make your friend Tyree a man of great importance.<br> Many ways? What else does she know about us? Tyree has told me much of you.<br> Do not blame him.<br> It was the price for saving your life.<br> We're simply strangers from From one of the lights in the sky.<br> And you have ways as far above firesticks as the sky above our world.<br> You will not speak of this to others.<br> I will not if I am made to understand.<br> Teach me.<br> There is an old custom among my people.<br> When a woman saves a man's life, he is grateful.<br> I am grateful.<br> A splendid custom, if not carried to extremes.<br> We once were as you are.<br> Spears, arrows.<br> There came a time when our weapons grew faster than our wisdom, and we almost destroyed ourselves.<br> We learned from this to make a rule during all our travels: Never to cause the same to happen to other worlds.<br> Just as a man must grow in his own way, in his own time.<br> Some men never grow.<br> Perhaps not as fast or in the way another thinks he should.<br> But we are wise enough to know that we are wise enough not to interfere in the way of a man or another world.<br> You must let the villagers destroy us? You will not help your friend and brother kill them instead? No! I said I will not kill! We must fight or die.<br> Is dying better? You would let him die when you have weapons to make him powerful and safe? Then he has the wrong friends.<br> And I have the wrong husband.<br> You will help in ways she does not understand.<br> I have faith in our friendship, James.<br> Come, before we lose the darkness.<br> What's bothering you, Jim? If we find the Klingons have helped the villagers, - there's certainly something we can do.<br> - That's what's bothering me, the something we may have to do.<br> The guard.<br> We must wait.<br> Tyree, supposing you had to fight, what then? Jim, this man believes in the same thing we believe in, that killing is stupid and useless.<br> Tyree.<br> Now, come.<br> Gun, ammunition.<br> Doctor.<br> You are late, my friend, Apella.<br> A quarrel by my people.<br> The division of some skins and a hill woman taken this morning.<br> It's hard to divide one woman.<br> Give her to the man who killed the most of her people.<br> The others will see the profit in bravery.<br> I'll make a Klingon of you yet.<br> Now, your next improvement.<br> Notice what we've done to the striker.<br> See how it holds the priming powder more securely? Fewer misfires.<br> When I return, we'll give you other improvements.<br> - A rifled barrel.<br> - What? A way to shoot further and straighter.<br> Jim.<br> Coal for a forge, sulphur for gunpowder.<br> Let's take a look inside.<br> Well, here's your forge.<br> People's exhibit number one: A chrome steel drill point.<br> This pig iron is almost carbon-free.<br> That village furnace certainly didn't produce it.<br> People's exhibit number two: A cold-rolled gun barrel rod, fashioned to look homemade.<br> You were right about the Klingons.<br> Make recorder and scanner tapes of everything.<br> Right.<br> It's a pity we can't include a live Klingon.<br> That would just about wrap Will it not be difficult to cut the small groove into the barrels? Quite simple.<br> - I'll show you the method.<br> - I thought my people would grow tired of killing.<br> But you were right.<br> They see that it is easier than trading.<br> And it has pleasures.<br> I feel it myself.<br> Like the hunt, but with richer rewards.<br> You will be rich one day, Apella, beyond your dreams.<br> The leader of a whole world.<br> A governor in the Klingon Empire.<br> Bones.<br> Guards! Intruders! Move, fast.<br> Nurse.<br> - Yes? - Hit me.<br> The pain will help me to consciousness.<br> Hit me.<br> - Hit you? No, I can't.<br> - Blast you, strike me.<br> If I don't regain consciousness soon, it may be too late.<br> Hit me! Harder! Again.<br> Continue.<br> The pain will help me to consciousness.<br> What are you doing, woman? - Leave me alone! He needs me.<br> - Have you gone daft? - Have you.<br>.<br>? - Go.<br> Let me That will be quite enough.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> - Please, release her.<br> - What's this all about? She was doing as I requested, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> A Vulcan form of self-healing.<br> As you saw, they must wait until the last possible moment, then fight their way back to consciousness.<br> Will you let me help you, Mr.<br> Spock? Thank you, nurse.<br> I'm quite fully recovered.<br> Yes, I see you are.<br> Men, this is the pan.<br> This is the hammer.<br> A hammer striking the pan causes a spark, ignites the powder and fires the flintlock.<br> Now, aim it as I showed you.<br> Hold your breath and squeeze the trigger gently.<br> - Well done.<br> Very, very, very good.<br> - Jim, I wanna talk to you.<br> Not here, Bones.<br> In the cave.<br> Yutan, your turn.<br> Do I have to say it? It's not bad enough there's already one serpent in Eden teaching one side about gunpowder.<br> You're gonna make sure they all know.<br> Exactly.<br> Each side receives the same knowledge and the same type of firearm.<br> Have you gone out of your mind? Yes, maybe you have.<br> Tyree's wife said there was something in that root.<br> She said now, that you can refuse her nothing.<br> Superstition.<br> Is it a coincidence this is exactly what she wants? Is it? She wants superior weapons.<br> That's the one thing neither side can have.<br> Bones.<br> Bones, the normal development of this planet was a status quo between the hill people and the villagers.<br> The Klingons changed that with the flintlocks.<br> If this planet is to develop the way it should, we must equalize both sides again.<br> Jim, that means you're condemning this whole planet to a war that may never end.<br> It could go on for year after year, - massacre after massacre.<br> - All right, doctor! All right.<br> All right, say I'm wrong.<br> Say I'm drugged.<br> Say the woman drugged me.<br> What is your sober, sensible solution to all this? I don't have a solution, but furnishing them firearms is certainly not the answer.<br> Bones, do you remember the 20th-century brush wars on the Asian continent? Two giant powers involved, much like the Klingons and ourselves.<br> - Neither side felt they could pull out.<br> - Yes, I remember.<br> It went on bloody year after bloody year.<br> What would you have suggested? That one side arm its friends with an overpowering weapon? Mankind would never have lived to travel space if they had.<br> No.<br> The only solution is what happened back then, balance of power.<br> And if the Klingons give their side even more? Then we arm our side with exactly that much more.<br> A balance of power, the trickiest, most difficult, dirtiest game of them all.<br> But the only one that preserves both sides.<br> And what about your friend Tyree? Will he understand this balance of power? No, probably not.<br> But I'm going to have to try and make him understand.<br> I never had a more difficult task.<br> Well, Jim, here's another morsel of agony for you.<br> Since Tyree won't fight, he will be one of the first to die.<br> Well, war isn't a good life, but it's life.<br> His wife is the only way to reach him.<br> If I tell her we're going to supply guns, maybe she'll convince him.<br> Position, Mr.<br> Scott? Entering distant orbit, sir.<br> Approaching rendezvous time.<br> - The Klingons? - They haven't spotted us yet, sir.<br> Looks like they're beaming someone aboard.<br> - Stand by to signal the captain.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Nona, pardon me.<br> You are here because I wished you here.<br> I thought it was my idea.<br> Yes, they always believe they come of free will.<br> Tyree even thought the same when I cast my first spell on him.<br> - Nona - Can you smell this fragrance? Some find it pleasing.<br> - I would like to talk to you.<br> - Again.<br> Some find it soothing.<br> - Yes.<br> - I would like Happy.<br> Yes, you feel good.<br> I feel dizzy.<br> Yes, you are lovely.<br> You're beautiful.<br> Kiss me.<br> Where's Captain Kirk? Tyree, the firestick, where is it? There! I left it there.<br> It's a fine thing to leave lying around.<br> Show us where it is.<br> I do not want it.<br> Jim.<br> Jim.<br> Who hit you? Nona.<br> I bring you victory for Apella! - Tyree's woman.<br> - She's a Kahn-ut-tu.<br> We won't trust this division to Apella.<br> Take me to him.<br> He will have the strength to use this new weapon.<br> Touch me again and this small box will kill you.<br> No! No! No! No, I'm all right.<br> My phaser.<br> She took it.<br> This weapon I bring you is far greater than your firestick.<br> Nona! Hill people! It's a trap.<br> The woman's tricked us.<br> She's dead.<br> I want more of these, Kirk.<br> Many more.<br> Yutan, two of those who killed my wife have escaped.<br> Track them down.<br> I will kill them.<br> Here.<br> Tomorrow, in the palm of her hands.<br> - Well, you got what you wanted.<br> - Not what I wanted, Bones, what had to be.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Spock, captain.<br> - I trust all has gone well.<br> - Spock, are you alive? An illogical question, doctor, since obviously you are hearing my voice.<br> Well, I don't know why I was worried.<br> You can't kill a computer.<br> Spock, ask Scotty how long it'd take him to reproduce a hundred flintlocks.<br> I didn't get that exactly, captain.<br> A hundred what? A hundred serpents.<br> Serpents for the Garden of Eden.<br> We're very tired, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Beam us up home.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Please assume a standard orbit about our planet, Captain.<br> Is that a request or demand? The choice is yours.<br> I read what is in your mind.<br> Words are unnecessary.<br> The planet is dead.<br> There's no possibility of life there as we understand life.<br> And I am as dead as my planet.<br> Does that frighten you, James Kirk? For if it does, if you let what is left of me perish, then all of you, my children, all of mankind must perish too.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange, new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's Log.<br> Stardate 4768.<br>3.<br> The Enterprise is in orbit above a planet whose surface, our sensors tell us, is devoid of all life.<br> A world destroyed and dead for at least a half million years, yet from it comes a voice, the energy of pure thought, telling us something has survived here for those thousands of centuries.<br> Since exploration and contact with alien intelligence is our primary mission, I've decided to risk the potential dangers and resume contact.<br> Log entry out.<br> How long before Starfleet receives that? Over three weeks at this distance, sir.<br> Captain.<br> Got something? Sensors registering some form of energy deep inside the planet.<br> Your probes have touched me, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Reading energy only, Captain.<br> No life forms.<br> I have locked your transporter device on my coordinates.<br> Please come to us.<br> Rescue us from oblivion.<br> Coming from deep under the planet surface, Captain under at least 100 miles of solid rock.<br> I will make it possible for your transporter to beam you that deep beneath the surface.<br> Have no fear.<br> Reading a chamber now.<br> Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, suitable for human life support.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, have Dr.<br> McCoy report to the Transporter Room in 10 minutes with standard landing-party equipment.<br> Yes, sir.<br> - Spock.<br> - Captain.<br> Captain, I do wish to inspect whatever this is that lived that long ago.<br> And I'd want my Science Officer with me on something as unusual as this, but it is full of unknowns, and we can't risk both of us being off the ship.<br> All power gone, sir.<br> On the other hand, perhaps this Sargon would like you to come with us.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - All normal.<br> No damage at all.<br> I see.<br> Will you transport down with us, Mr.<br> Spock? - Evidently, Captain.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, you have the conn.<br> Why no briefing on this? I'd at least like to know what we're getting into.<br> Easy.<br> As long as you know there's something down there you know as much as we do.<br> The rest is only guesses.<br> I don't like it, sir.<br> The transporter coordinates preset by an alien of some sort.<br> You could materialize inside solid rock.<br> - Inside solid rock? - Unlikely.<br> These coordinates correspond with the location of the subterranean chamber.<br> I have a feeling that they, or it, could destroy us just standing here if they or it wanted to.<br> \"They or it\"? - Who are you? - Dr.<br> Ann Mulhall, Astrobiology.<br> Well, I was ordered to report here for landing-party duty.<br> By whom? Strange.<br> I'm not sure.<br> Well, I'm not a liar, Captain.<br> I did receive an order to report here for duty.<br> I'm sure she did, Captain, just as you received an order to bring me along.<br> Oh, yes.<br> Let's get back to this solid rock business.<br> Just how much rock are we going to go through? Approximately 112.<br>37 miles, doctor.<br> Miles? Are you joking? No, we're not.<br> Let's go.<br> Please stand ready.<br> I will operate your controls.<br> Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind No.<br> No, if I'd be useful.<br> As long as you're going down, I might as well take a medical look at whatever this is.<br> Captain, the security guards.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Can you read me, Captain? Yes, Scotty.<br> And I shouldn't be able to this deep inside the planet.<br> But perhaps that's been arranged for us too.<br> Is the security guard up there?

They're an alloy or substance completely unknown to me, much stronger and harder than anything I've measured before.<br> All readings are off the scale, Captain.<br> The air seems fresh.<br> It must be re-circulated somehow.<br> Is that for us? Or does \"it\" need fresh air? Welcome.<br> I am Sargon.<br> Sargon, would it harm you if I You may use your tricorder, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your readings will show energy, but no substance.<br> Sealed in this receptacle is the essence of my mind.<br> Pure energy.<br> Matter without form.<br> Impossible.<br> But you once had a body of some type? A body much as yours, my children, although our minds were infinitely greater.<br> That's twice you've referred to us as \"my children.<br>\" Because it is possible you are our descendants, Captain Kirk.<br> Six thousand centuries ago our vessels were colonizing this galaxy just as your own starships have now begun to explore that vastness.<br> As you now leave your own seed on distant planets, so we left our seed behind us.<br> Perhaps your own legends of an Adam and an Eve were two of our travellers.<br> Our beliefs and our studies indicate that life on our planet Earth evolved independently.<br> That would tend, however, to explain certain elements of Vulcan pre-history.<br> In either case, I do not know.<br> It was so long ago and the records of our travels were lost in the cataclysm - which we loosened upon ourselves.<br> - A war? A struggle for such goals and the unleashing of such power that you could not comprehend.<br> Then perhaps your intelligence wasn't so great, Sargon.<br> We faced a similar crisis in our earlier nuclear age.<br> We found the wisdom not to destroy ourselves.<br> And we survived our primitive nuclear era, my son.<br> But there comes to all races, an ultimate crisis which you have yet to face.<br> I don't understand.<br> One day our minds became so powerful we dared think of ourselves as gods.<br> You said you wanted our help.<br> What is it you wish? Just a moment, doctor.<br> I am Sargon.<br> Where's our Captain? Where's Jim Kirk? He is unharmed.<br> I have taken his body to demonstrate.<br> I won't go along with this! Back to where you were, Sargon, or whatever you are.<br> And if he refuses, doctor? What do you propose to do with your phaser? That is still Jim's body.<br> Lungs filling with air again to see again heart pumping, arteries surging with blood again.<br> I can feel.<br> After a half a million years to be again.<br> Your Captain has an excellent body, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I compliment you both on the condition in which you maintained it.<br> What are your plans for it? Can you exchange places again when you wish? Have no fear.<br> Your Captain is quite unharmed.<br> Although his mind generates insufficient energy for him to speak from there as I do.<br> - Doctor.<br> - Yes, I have the same readings.<br> Are you aware of what's happening to his body? Heart action doubled, temperature 104 degrees.<br> He'll die if you don't leave his body soon.<br> What is it you want of us? In the next room there are other receptacles.<br> The other two of us that survived.<br> You, Dr.<br> Ann Mulhall and you Mr.<br> Spock we require your bodies also.<br> We must have Captain Kirk and you so that we may live again.<br> Even for us, a half million years is almost too long to wait.<br> Two others still survive, Henoch and Thalassa.<br> Thalassa, my Thalassa I am pleased you survived.<br> Forgive me.<br> It has been so very long.<br> When the struggle came which devastated your planet Only the best minds were chosen to survive.<br> Thalassa, my wife, as you may have guessed.<br> Henoch, from the other side.<br> Realizing our mistake, we attempted to perpetuate both sides.<br> We built this chamber here in order to preserve our essence in this fashion.<br> Fascinating.<br> We knew the seed that we had planted on other planets would take root, that one day you would build vessels as we did.<br> And one day you would come here.<br> These others, they were stored differently than you.<br> But it was your task to remain in the receptacle out there And search the heavens with my mind, probing, waiting, probing.<br> And then one day my mind touched your vessel and brought you here.<br> So you could steal our bodies from us? To steal? To take them from you? No, my children, you misunderstand.<br> We mean only that you should lend us your bodies for a short time.<br> And destroy them.<br> Just as you're burning that one up now.<br> Heart beat 262, Spock, the entire metabolic rate correspondingly high.<br> I will return your Captain to you before the body limit has been reached.<br> Our bodies, Sargon.<br> For what purpose? To build To build humanoid robots.<br> We must borrow your bodies long enough to have the use of your hands, your fingers.<br> Then you intend to construct mechanical bodies, move your minds into them, and then return our bodies to us.<br> We have engineers, technicians.<br> Why can't they build your robots for you? No, our methods our skills are far beyond your abilities.<br> It is time.<br> Is it you, Jim? Good.<br> His metabolic rate is back to normal.<br> Captain, do you know what happened? - Do you remember any part of it? - Yes.<br> Sargon borrowed my body.<br> I was floating in time and space.<br> He doesn't appear to be harmed physically anyway.<br> Spock, I remember! When Sargon and I exchanged, as we passed each other for an instant we were one.<br> I know him now.<br> I know what he is, and what he wants.<br> And I don't fear him.<br> That's the most ridiculous statement I've ever heard.<br> An alien practically hijacks your body and then corks you into a bottle I'm afraid I must agree with Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> You could be suffering from a form of false euphoria.<br> - Sargon.<br> - I understand, my son.<br> Go to your vessel.<br> All who are involved must agree to this.<br> After all these centuries, we can wait a few more hours.<br> And what if we should decide against you? Then you may go as free as you came.<br> You're going to what? - Are they all right in the head, doctor? - No comment.<br> A simple transference, their minds and ours.<br> Quite simple.<br> Happens every day.<br> Scotty, I need your approval too, since you'll be working with them, furnishing them with all they need to make the android robots.<br> You won't be working with them you'll be working with us, our bodies.<br> - They'll be inside us and we'll be - It all seems rather indecent to me.<br> I'm not so certain of that, doctor.<br> It is scientifically fascinating.<br> Once inside their mechanical bodies, Engineer they can leave this planet, travel back with us.<br> With their knowledge, mankind could leap ahead 10,000 years.<br> Bones, they'll show us medical advances, miracles you never dreamed possible.<br> Scotty, engineering advances, vessels this size, with engines the size of walnuts.<br> - You're joking.<br> - No, he's not.<br> They're giants and we're insects beside them.<br> They could destroy us without meaning to.<br> And all he wants is the body of our Captain and our second in command too.<br> Coincidence? They selected us as the most compatible bodies.<br> What's your attitude on that, doctor? Well, if we all agree l'm willing to host Thalassa's mind.<br> I'm a scientist.<br> The opportunity is an extraordinary one for experimentation, observation.<br> A starship engine the size of a walnut? That's impossible.<br> But, I don't suppose there'd be any harm in looking over diagrams on it.<br> Bones, you could stop all this by saying no.<br> That's why I called you all here together.<br> We'll all be deeply involved.<br> It must be unanimous.<br> Then I'll still want one question answered to my satisfaction.<br> Why? Not a list of possible miracles.<br> But a simple basic understandable \"why\" that overrides all danger.<br> Let's not kid ourselves that there is no potential danger in this.<br> They used to say, if man could fly, he'd have wings.<br> But he did fly, he discovered he had to.<br> Do you wish that the first Apollo Mission hadn't reached the moon, or that we hadn't gone on to Mars and then to the nearest star? That's like saying you wish that you still operated with scalpels, and sewed your patients up with catgut, like your great-great-great- great-grandfather used to.<br> I'm in command.<br> I could order this.<br> But I'm not because Dr.<br> McCoy is right in pointing out the enormous danger potential in any contact with life and intelligence, as fantastically advanced as this.<br> But I must point out that the possibilities the potential for knowledge and advancement is equally great.<br> Risk.<br> Risk is our business.<br> That's what this starship is all about.<br> That's why we're aboard her.<br> You may dissent without prejudice.<br> Do I hear a negative vote? Engineer stand by to beam aboard three receptacles.<br> The extreme power of the alien mind will drive the heart action dangerously high and the body functions will race many times their normal metabolism.<br> So we're going to have to monitor this very carefully.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, I guess we're about as ready as we'll ever be.<br> - Jim.<br> - Ready, Sargon.<br> The transference is complete.<br> Metabolic rate is doubled and rising, doctor.<br> Hello.<br> You are a lovely female.<br> A pleasant sight to wake up to after half a million years.<br> - Thank you.<br> - You're welcome.<br> I'd forgotten what it felt like even to breathe again.<br> Sargon? Here.<br> In this body.<br> I am not displeased, my husband.<br> Your body is not unlike that which was your own.<br> And I too, am pleased, beloved.<br> After so long so very long.<br> Yes.<br> This is an excellent body, doctor.<br> I seemed to have received the best of the three.<br> Strength, hearing, eyesight, all far above your human norms.<br> I'm surprised the Vulcans never conquered your race.<br> Vulcans worship peace above all, Henoch.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Just as we do, doctor.<br> Nurse.<br> Doctor.<br> Henoch, you'd better get back to bed too.<br> It will be unnecessary, doctor.<br> This Vulcan body is accustomed to the higher metabolism.<br> Sargon, it won't work.<br> You've got to get out before you kill them.<br> We will vacate at once until you can administer a metabolic reduction injection.<br> - A what? - I'll prepare the formula, Sargon.<br> Henoch, your condition? I can continue in this body for several hours.<br> Fortunate.<br> We will vacate at once.<br> This woman will assist me.<br> You will take me to your pharmacology laboratory.<br> Bones, what It was close, Jim.<br> You both barely got back alive.<br> Unless the formula works, we can't risk it again.<br> Now, this formula will reduce the heart action and the bodily functions to normal.<br> While the bodies are occupied, you will administer one injection of 10 cc's each hour.<br> I understand.<br> This hypo you will code mark for Thalassa.<br> And this one, you will code mark for me.<br> Yes, sir.<br> This one, you will administer to Captain Kirk while Sargon is in his body.<br> This hypo does not contain the same formula.<br> No, that's correct.<br> But since I will arrange for you to administer each of the injections, no one else will notice.<br> But without the same formula, Captain Kirk will die.<br> What were you saying? I was I wanted to say something.<br> I've forgotten what it was.<br> You were about to say that you watched me prepare the formula and fill each of the hypos.<br> Yes, that was it.<br> I will inform Dr.<br> McCoy that each is properly filled for each patient.<br> Very good.<br> You see, Sargon would not permit me to keep this body.<br> It is therefore necessary for you to kill your Captain so that Sargon will die with him.<br> Enterprise Medical Log.<br> Stardate 4769.<br>1.<br> Three alien minds now inhabit the bodies of Captain Kirk, Science Officer Spock, and Dr.<br> Ann Mulhall.<br> As planned, the construction of android robots is underway.<br> All is proceeding as expected and as promised.<br> I can find no reason for concern but yet, I am filled with foreboding.<br> Sargon, I remember a day long ago.<br> We sat beside a silver lake.<br> The air was scented with the flowers of our planet.<br> I remember.<br> You held my hand like this.<br> I think it best not to remember so well.<br> In two days you'll have hands of your own again, Thalassa.<br> Mechanically efficient and quite human looking.<br> Android, robot hands, of course.<br> Hands without feeling.<br> Enjoy the taste of life while you can.<br> Our minds will have survived.<br> And as androids we can move among the people who do live teaching them, helping them not to make the errors we did.<br> - What is it, Sargon? - Nothing.<br> Our next injection will renovate me.<br> Do not be concerned.<br> Nurse, how are the last metabolical readings on our patients? You'll find them excellent, doctor.<br> Well within normal.<br> Is something wrong, Miss Chapel? Yes I had something to say.<br> - I can't seem to remember.<br> - Regarding our patients? Yes.<br> That must be it.<br> I am so pleased the way they are responding, doctor.<br> The formula is working perfectly.<br> You look tired, Miss Chapel.<br> Perhaps you'd care for me to administer the last few injections.<br> Tired? Not at all, doctor.<br> Thank you for asking.<br> Thank you.<br> Have you prepared the megaton hydra coils for the drawings Sargon supplied? For all the good it will do you.<br> It's a fancy name but how will something that looks like a drop of jelly make this thing work? You'll need micro-gears and some form of pulley that does what a muscle does.<br> That would be highly inefficient.<br> I tell you, lady.<br> This thing won't work.<br> It will have twice the strength and agility of your body, Engineer, and will last a thousand years.<br> That is, assuming you'll stop wasting your time and allow us to complete it.<br> A thousand-year prison, Thalassa.<br> When it wears out, we'll build another one, and we'll lock ourselves into it for another thousand years, and then another and another.<br> Sargon has closed his mind to a better way with these bodies.<br> They're not ours, Henoch.<br> When you awoke in this body, Thalassa you said how good it was to breathe again to have eyes and to see again, to feel to live and feel again, Thalassa.<br> Just think, how much we can do for mankind.<br> Are these bodies too much to ask for in return? Would you prefer this? No.<br> I'm beginning to hate it.<br> Sickbay.<br> Sickbay.<br> McCoy.<br> Sargon here, McCoy.<br> I'm in your - Deck 6 briefing room.<br> - You sound terrible.<br> Wait there for me.<br> Sargon, what is it? Nothing of importance.<br> Fatigue perhaps.<br> Henoch's formula.<br> Yes, I wanted to be certain there was no error.<br> The formula is correct.<br> Don't be concerned.<br> It is an excellent body.<br> There you see, I feel better already.<br> In time our host body will become accustomed to us, husband.<br> Injections will no longer be necessary.<br> That will take months, perhaps years.<br> We haven't that choice, Thalassa.<br> Husband feel the touch of my hand, husband.<br> No, beloved.<br> - If we torment ourselves - Beloved.<br> What will that word mean to a machine? Our thoughts will intertwine.<br> Will they, husband? Will they intertwine like this? Can two minds press close like this? Can robot lips do this? Sargon, what is it? Hypo.<br> Doctor, help him.<br> He's dead.<br> Medical Log.<br> Stardate 4770.<br>3.<br> Do I list one death or two? When Kirk's body died, Sargon was too far distant from his receptacle to transfer back.<br> Sargon is dead.<br> But is Captain Kirk dead? His body is, but his consciousness is still in the receptacle, into which it was transferred earlier.<br> All his vital organs are now working, doctor.<br> Yes, we can keep them going for a few weeks or a month, for all the good it'll do.<br> Why pretend to work on that thing, Henoch? You know you never intended to leave Spock's body.<br> This is your new home, Thalassa.<br> Once occupied, I'll add female features and some texturing.<br> You, no doubt, want the mechanism to at least appear to be a woman.<br> - It is ready, Thalassa.<br> - No! You have no excuse to keep the real body any longer.<br> Sargon would have required that you enter the mechanism immediately.<br> I cannot live in that thing.<br> Doctor? Yes? Would you like to save your Captain Kirk? But you said that was impossible.<br> We have many powers Sargon did not permit us to use.<br> He thought them too tempting to us.<br> This body pleases me.<br> I intend to keep it.<br> I see.<br> And Henoch intends to keep Spock's body, of course.<br> Henoch's plans are his own affair.<br> I wish only to exist in peace as a living woman.<br> - If you're asking my approval - I require only your silence.<br> Only you and I will know that Dr.<br> Mulhall has not returned to her body.<br> Isn't that worth your Captain's life? Doctor we can take what we wish.<br> Neither you, this ship, nor all your worlds have the power to stop us.<br> Neither Jim nor I can trade a body we don't own.<br> - It belongs to a young woman.<br> - Who you hardly know.<br> Almost a stranger to you.<br> I will not peddle flesh.<br> I'm a physician.<br> A physician? In contrast to what we are you are a prancing savage medicine man.<br> You dare defy one you should be on your knees worshiping? I could destroy you with a single thought.<br> Stop! Sargon was right.<br> Temptations within a living body are too great.<br> Forgive me.<br> I am pleased, my beloved.<br> It is good you have found the truth yourself.<br> Sargon.<br> Where are you? I thought you destroyed by Henoch.<br> I have power even Henoch does not suspect, beloved.<br> Yes, I see.<br> I understand.<br> Just as we would have placed our consciousness within robots Sargon has placed his into your vessel.<br> Doctor.<br> Doctor, leave us.<br> Sargon has a plan.<br> We have much work to do.<br> This is the Sickbay.<br> Get me Nurse Chapel, what in the devil Jim, are you all right? Yes, I'm fine, Bones.<br> - Thalassa? - She is now with Sargon, doctor.<br> I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my own body.<br> Jim, the receptacles.<br> Spock's consciousness was in one of them.<br> - It was necessary.<br> - What are you talking about? There is no Spock to return to his body.<br> You've killed a loyal officer.<br> Your best friend! Bones, prepare a hypo.<br> The fastest, deadliest poison to Vulcans.<br> Spock's consciousness is gone.<br> We must kill his body the thing in it.<br> Must I make an example of you too, Helm? Pain, Captain.<br> And you, my dear Fortunately, doctor, I know every thought of every mind around me.<br> See? Take the hypo from him.<br> And inject him with it.<br> You fools! I'll simply transfer to another place, another body.<br> Sargon.<br> No, Sargon, please, let me let me transfer Spock.<br> My friend, Spock.<br> If there'd only been another way.<br> I could not allow your sacrifice of one so close to you.<br> You're alive.<br> There was enough poison in that hypo to kill 10 Vulcans.<br> No, doctor.<br> I allowed you to believe that to be true so that Henoch would read your thoughts and believe it also.<br> Sargon.<br> It seems, doctor, the injection was only enough to cause unconsciousness.<br> But Henoch believed and fled the body.<br> He is destroyed.<br> But your vessel was destroyed too.<br> Where was your consciousness kept? The place Henoch would least suspect, Captain.<br> That is why I was summoned into the Sickbay, doctor.<br> Mr.<br> Spock's consciousness was placed in me.<br> We shared consciousness together.<br> We now know we cannot permit ourselves to exist in your world, my children.<br> Thalassa and I must now also depart into oblivion.<br> Is there any way we can help you, Sargon? Yes, my son.<br> You can allow Thalassa and me to share your bodies again.<br> A last moment together.<br> Oblivion together does not frighten me, beloved.<br> Promise we will be together.<br> I promise, beloved.<br> Together forever.<br> Forever, beloved forever.<br> Well, I'm sure that Sargon appreciated your cooperation, Dr.<br> Mulhall.<br> Yes, I was happy to cooperate, Captain.<br> It was beautiful.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tPassing outer planet, Zeon.<br> We want the inner one, Ekos.<br> Plot a standard orbit, Mr.<br> Chekov, and take us in.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, try to raise John Gill on Starfleet communications.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Starfleet's been trying for six months.<br> If he's still alive, isn't it unlikely that he'd receive us now? I don't know, Bones.<br> We're here to find out what's happened because I don't know.<br> I never met John Gill, but I studied Earth history from the text he prepared.<br> I knew him very well.<br> He was my instructor at the Academy.<br> What impressed me most was his treatment of Earth history as causes and motivations rather than dates and events.<br> Captain, no response on any Starfleet channel.<br> Spacecraft approaching from inner planet.<br> - From Ekos? - Yes, but it must be a Zeon ship.<br> The Zeons do have a crude interplanetary capability.<br> Reaction-powered.<br> A small rocket.<br> It is on an intercept course.<br> That would mean it has sophisticated detection devices, which neither Zeon nor Ekos should have.<br> - Have you raised anyone, Lieutenant? - Nothing, sir.<br> Captain, it is an unmanned probe which seems to be carrying a warhead.<br> Stand by phasers.<br> - Phasers ready.<br> - Range, Mr.<br> Chekov? Two thousand kilometres.<br> Closing fast.<br> Fire.<br> Fascinating.<br> A thermonuclear warhead.<br> That's generations ahead of where these people should be technically.<br> - How did they manage that? - Maybe they had help.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Plot a maximum orbit.<br> Take us out of range of their detection devices.<br> Most interesting.<br> We were attacked by a thermonuclear missile from a planet which should have no such weapon.<br> - Orbit computed and locked in, sir.<br> - Execute.<br> Captain, no response from John Gill on any channel.<br> He must be dead.<br> And what's going on down there on Ekos? According to our records, the Ekosians are a primitive, warlike people in a state of anarchy.<br> The other planet, Zeon, has a relatively high technology, and its people are peaceful.<br> We've run into a far more serious problem than the disappearance of John Gill.<br> Spock, you and I will beam down.<br> Bones, one precaution.<br> Prepare a subcutaneous transponder in the event we can't use our communicators.<br> Insert the transponder, doctor.<br> Make one low pass to communication range in three hours.<br> If we fail to make contact at the appointed time, take our coordinates from the transponder and beam us aboard no matter what our condition may be.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Whatever your condition.<br> - You ready? - Ready, captain.<br> Energize.<br> The Ekosians are humanoid, so there's apt to be a similarity in architecture.<br> Interesting.<br> Hide! They're right behind me! Hide! Hide! Zeon pig.<br> On your feet, pig.<br> Captain, the Non-lnterference Directive.<br> Hold.<br> Hands above your head, Zeon.<br> Higher.<br> Keep your hands in the air so you don't touch anything Ekosian.<br> You swine have defiled us for the last time.<br> But that's now ended.<br> Move.<br> Unbelievable.<br> - Do you recognise those uniforms? - Mid-20th century Earth.<br> The nation-state called Nazi Germany.<br> Attention.<br> Attention.<br> Attention.<br> An announcement from FÃÂ¼hrer Headquarters.<br> Today, the FÃÂ¼hrer has ordered our glorious capital to be made Zeon-free.<br> Starting at dawn, our heroic troops began flushing out the Zeon monsters who've been poisoning our planet.<br> How could this have happened? The chances of another planet developing a culture like Nazi Germany, using the forms, the symbols, the uniforms of 20th century Earth, are so fantastically slim.<br> Virtually impossible, captain.<br> Yet the evidence is quite clear.<br> The FÃÂ¼hrer's headquarters reports repulsing an attack by Zeon spacecraft.<br> Our missiles utterly destroyed the enemy.<br> You look quite well for a man who's been utterly destroyed, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> At this patriotic demonstration, Deputy FÃÂ¼hrer Melakon presented the Iron Cross, second class, to Daras, hero of the Fatherland.<br> Everywhere preparations go forward toward the final decision: Death to Zeon.<br> Long live the Fatherland.<br> Long live the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> - That's John Gill.<br> The FÃÂ¼hrer? - Fascinating.<br> You.<br> Zeons.<br> What kind of monsters are the Zeons sending against us? You're right.<br> He's not one of us.<br> - What do you mean, us? - Look at him.<br> Spock, take his uniform.<br> You propose we pass ourselves off as Nazis, captain? If John Gill is the FÃÂ¼hrer, it would seem the logical approach.<br> That's very well taken, captain.<br> That helmet covers a multitude of sins.<br> Lieutenant.<br> What have we here? - A Zeon? - Yes.<br> Obviously he's not one of us.<br> I captured him.<br> Is that not the correct procedure with enemies of the Fatherland? With all Zeon pigs, lieutenant.<br> - Take charge of him.<br> - With pleasure.<br> Today we have a surprise planned for you, Zeon.<br> Your uniform, captain.<br> Yes, it's a shame yours isn't as attractive as mine.<br> - Gestapo, I believe.<br> - Quite correct.<br> You should make a very convincing Nazi.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Have you forgotten how to salute? Your papers.<br> Your orders, lieutenant.<br> He wants to see your orders in the jacket.<br> The lieutenant's a little dazed.<br> He captured several Zeons single-handed.<br> One of the pigs struck him before he dropped.<br> I promise you, that pig will never get up again.<br> Good work, lieutenant.<br> - Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> - Hail to the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> This is a day to remember, major.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Better see a doctor.<br> You don't look well.<br> Your colour.<br> - Yes, I shall tend to it, major.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> Your helmet, remove it.<br> We have urgent business with the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> Lieutenant, remove your helmet.<br> Enough.<br> Do you wish to speak now? Tell me your orders! You were sent here to kill our FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> Confess! Do you want some more persuasion? You're making this a one-sided conversation, major.<br> Do not joke with me, Zeon pig.<br> Who is this alien? Things might go easier for you if you tell me about him.<br> Let me speak to your FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> I'll tell him everything he wants to know.<br> You'll be glad to talk to me before I'm through with you.<br> Major.<br> Chairman Eneg.<br> Your Excellency, I am honoured.<br> I have been interrogating these two spies captured in I've had a full report.<br> You are not from Zeon.<br> Obviously.<br> Where do you come from? I'll explain when I see the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> What is your business with the FÃÂ¼hrer? I'll discuss that only with him.<br> Pig! You're speaking to the chairman of the party.<br> That's enough, major.<br> What were the weapons found on you? What design? Our famous S.<br>S.<br> Laboratories have been unable to discover how the weapons work.<br> Excellency, give me a few minutes with them.<br> - I promise you I'll have them - You had a few minutes without result.<br> The trouble with you S.<br>S.<br> Is that you don't realise that punishment becomes ineffective after a certain point.<br> Men become insensitive.<br> Yes, Excellency.<br> Lock them up.<br> Let their pain argue with them.<br> Then I will question them.<br> Excellency, the standing order is to interrogate and execute.<br> The interrogation is finished, therefore Finished? What have you learned? Hold them for an hour.<br> - Excellency, the order - That is my order, major.<br> I suggest you do not disobey it.<br> Yes, Excellency.<br> All right, pigs.<br> I shall keep my eye on the clock.<br> When the hour is up, you will die most unpleasantly, I promise you.<br> Lock them up.<br> John Gill was the kindest gentlest man I ever knew.<br> For him to be a Nazi is impossible.<br> Why did they take you? You're not a Zeon.<br> And he certainly is not one.<br> Why do the Nazis treat you as enemies? Why do the Nazis hate Zeons? Why? Because without us to hate, there would be nothing to hold them together.<br> So the party has built us into a threat, - a disease to be wiped out.<br> - Is Zeon a threat to them? Where did you come from? Our warlike period ended dozens of generations ago.<br> We came here, we thought we were civilising the Ekosians.<br> It would seem the assumption was premature.<br> Were they like this when you first came here? Warlike, yes.<br> But not vicious.<br> That started when the Nazi movement began.<br> It was only a few years ago.<br> That would coincide with the time of John Gill's arrival.<br> When they've destroyed us here, they will attack our planet.<br> They'll use the technology we gave them.<br> The danger is that taking life is so repugnant to our people I'm afraid we'll go down without a struggle.<br> But after what I saw in the street today, I think I could kill.<br> - Do you know the plan of this building? - Why? If we can get to the S.<br>S.<br> Weapons Laboratory, get our weapons back, we might be able to stop the slaughter of the Zeons.<br> Why should you be interested in saving Zeons? We must get our communicators and contact the ship.<br> I must point out, captain, the flaw in the plan is this locked door and the guard beyond it.<br> To the logical mind, the outlook is somewhat gloomy.<br> - The transponders.<br> - Yes.<br> And a way to shed some light on the gloom, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Of course.<br> The rubindium crystals in the transponders.<br> Are you trying to kill yourselves? I know it's there.<br> McCoy put it in.<br> You have the figures computed, Mr.<br> Spock? Yes.<br> It will be necessary to hold the crystals rigidly at a specific distance which I believe should be would be approximately there.<br> - That is, of course, a crude estimation.<br> - Of course.<br> What is it you're making there, some kind of radio? No, not a radio.<br> The power from that light is very low.<br> Yes, to reach that light, I shall require some sort of platform.<br> I would be honoured, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Now, the rubindium crystals should find enough power here to achieve a necessary stimulus.<br> As I recall from the history of physics the ancient lasers were able to achieve the necessary excitation even using crude natural crystals.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the guard did a very professional job on my back.<br> - I would appreciate it if you'd hurry.<br> - Yes, of course, captain.<br> You realise that the aim will, of course, be very crude.<br> I don't care if you hit the broad side of a barn.<br> Just hurry, please.<br> Captain, why should I aim at such a structure? Never mind, Spock.<br> Just get on with the job.<br> Oh, my goodness.<br> Beautiful.<br> Spock, Spock.<br> Beautiful.<br> Over there.<br> I'll create a commotion.<br> Help! Help! I'll talk! I'll talk! I can't stand it anymore! I'll talk! Guard! Guard! I'll talk! Guard.<br> I'll talk.<br> I'll talk.<br> The pain.<br> Take me with you.<br> Give me a chance to fight them.<br> Captain, I remind you, we did not intend to fight.<br> Take me with you or you'll never find the laboratory.<br> Take him with us, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> He's got a point.<br> He's our guide.<br> - Which is the laboratory door? - At the end of the hall.<br> All right, Zeon pigs, move.<br> Zeon pig.<br> They do nothing right.<br> Don't worry, they're on their way to the laboratory for experimental work.<br> They'll pay.<br> Move! Move, move! Cover the door.<br> Here they are, the communicators.<br> Disassembled.<br> - Can you get one to work? - Possibly.<br> Who are you people? The phasers? - I do not see them.<br> - Where do you come from? \"Alien pistols have been sent to Gestapo Command Headquarters.<br>\" Well, that takes care of the phasers.<br> You Zeons, for peaceful people, are pretty thorough.<br> Yes.<br> With this uniform, we can steal a car, get out of the capital.<br> We came to get John Gill.<br> Captain, without phasers, and until we're able to communicate with the ship, it is illogical to assume that we can hold out against the entire military force of this planet.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock, you made your point.<br> Get into the uniform and hide those ears again.<br> Hunting's good.<br> We've caught so many Zeons, we've got to dump them outside.<br> Who's with you? Davod, it's all right.<br> They helped me escape from the prison.<br> - I owe them my life.<br> - Isak, what is all this? Abrom.<br> Abrom, thank God you're well.<br> This is my brother.<br> They were in the prison, beaten as I was, Abrom.<br> - Why were you in that prison? - I was trying to see the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> - The FÃÂ¼hrer? - If I can see him, there may be a way of stopping this insanity.<br> Abrom, I owe them my life.<br> Isak Uletta is dead.<br> Shot down in the streets.<br> She would have been my wife.<br> She lived for five hours while they walked past her and spat on her.<br> Our own people were unable to help her.<br> Now you ask me to help strangers.<br> If we adopt the ways of the Nazis we're as bad as the Nazis.<br> Captain I suggest the most profitable use of our time would be to reassemble our communicators.<br> May I work undisturbed somewhere? This way.<br> Now, using parts from both, I've completed one communicator.<br> I do not know if the circuits are correct, captain.<br> There is no way to test it, except in actual use.<br> The Enterprise won't be within range for another hour.<br> Over there against the wall, all of you.<br> The girl on the viewscreen.<br> The one receiving the medal.<br> - Daras.<br> - Quiet.<br> Hands in the air, Zeon swine.<br> So you're the three who escaped from the Chancellery Detention Centre.<br> What was your plan? Speak.<br> It's the last chance you'll get.<br> - I must see the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> It's urgent.<br> - Urgent? I'll bet it is.<br> I alone am responsible for what happens here.<br> Do you know what we do to responsible Zeons? Now we finish the job.<br> Where do you stop, you Nazis? After you've killed the last of us, what do you do? Turn the guns against yourselves? No, don't shoot, please.<br> No, wait.<br> No more.<br> You've proved they're on our side.<br> Now, please forgive us.<br> But we had to be absolutely certain.<br> Yes, if we had taken you into our confidence, we could have betrayed all our people, if you had been Nazi spies.<br> All right, leave us.<br> The Gestapo methods are frighteningly efficient.<br> Now, we must be very careful in order to survive here.<br> We of the underground don't know who our leaders are.<br> That way, if we break under pressure, we can only betray a handful of our people.<br> This young lady is a Nazi, a hero of the Fatherland.<br> We saw her being decorated.<br> I'm an Ekosian, fighting the terrible thing that's happened to my people.<br> The decoration was for betraying my own father to the party.<br> It was my father's idea.<br> You see, he used to be very close to the FÃÂ¼hrer, and then he saw the changes and where they were leading.<br> He turned against the party.<br> They imprisoned him.<br> - Melakon sentenced him to death.<br> - Melakon? The Deputy FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> He's taken over.<br> My father denounced me, making it appear as though I had betrayed him.<br> He gave me a weapon to continue the fight with.<br> But how could this have seemed right to John Gill? - Who? - John Gill, your FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> - He's one of our people.<br> - And what is your people? I'm Captain James Kirk of the United Spaceship Enterprise.<br> This is my first officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> John Gill, your FÃÂ¼hrer, was sent here by the Federation as a cultural observer.<br> You mean that the FÃÂ¼hrer is an alien? - That is correct.<br> I grew up to admire him.<br> Later, to hate and despise everything he stands for.<br> But I always thought he was one of us.<br> Now to hear that he's an alien sent to destroy us That was not his mission, ever.<br> He was sent here to observe, not to interfere.<br> Something went wrong.<br> And that's why we're here.<br> To find out and to correct.<br> - We must see him.<br> - It's impossible.<br> Even if this were another time, it still would be impossible.<br> He sees no one.<br> No one but Melakon.<br> - He's under maximum security.<br> - Maximum security.<br> Is he so afraid? There are many of us, both Ekosians and younger Zeons who would gladly risk our lives to kill him.<br> I don't understand what's going on here.<br> This goes against every principle that John Gill ever believed in.<br> Our only chance is to see him, and quickly.<br> He makes his speech tonight from the Chancellery.<br> All the top party officials will be there.<br> Will you be there? Of course.<br> As a symbol of the proper attitude toward the Fatherland.<br> As an honoured member of the party, she could get us past the guards.<br> Only the topmost trusted officials will be allowed in.<br> The country will watch from the viewscreens.<br> No one knows for sure, but I'm afraid it'll be a formal declaration of war against Zeon.<br> Their Final Solution.<br> - You must get us in there.<br> - It would be suicide.<br> It's a risk living at all, the way things are going.<br> If the captain believes he has a chance, I'm willing to commit suicide with him.<br> You? A Zeon? You expect to get into the Chancellery? It's even more my fight than yours.<br> - Lights.<br> - You, what is your business here? Get me some lights on her.<br> It's Party Secretary Daras.<br> The FÃÂ¼hrer's Special Documentary Corps.<br> - Smile, corporal.<br> - Excuse me.<br> Captain, I'm beginning to understand why you Earthmen enjoy gambling.<br> No matter how carefully one computes the odds of success, there is still a certain exhilaration in the risk.<br> Very good, Spock.<br> We may make a human of you yet.<br> I hope not.<br> Let's go.<br> Lights.<br> Thank you.<br> - Where does the FÃÂ¼hrer enter? - He doesn't.<br> They watch him on the big screen.<br> There, at the end of the room.<br> He broadcasts from the booth for security.<br> They've got the booth curtained off.<br> Bring that light to the side of her face.<br> Where's the entrance to the broadcast booth? There, at the end of the corridor.<br> You're not going to try to get into the broadcast booth.<br> We're gonna try.<br> Sir, is this light a little higher, better here? Good.<br> If we can distract the guard, I can get a machine gun.<br> It's a small booth.<br> I can shoot through the door.<br> We're here to get John Gill, and alive, not for your personal satisfaction.<br> Is that clear? Let's try down there.<br> - Lights, please.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Gentlemen, this is for the record of the FÃÂ¼hrer's Final Solution speech.<br> We're documenting the men responsible for Smile, gentlemen.<br> There'll be more coverage later.<br> Thank you.<br> Let's get a moving shot down the hall.<br> What have we accomplished? You should have let me shoot him.<br> Captain, it was John Gill.<br> But he never moved, never once looked up.<br> Yes.<br> That may be part of the plan, the semi-divine detachment.<br> Or a deep psychosis.<br> It may be simpler than that.<br> He may be drugged.<br> We need McCoy.<br> Is there a place, a room we can be alone for a few minutes? - I'm going to send for help.<br> - Send for? It takes too long to explain.<br> Any place will do.<br> The cloak room? It may not have the range it had.<br> - In fact, it may not work at all.<br> - Think positively, Spock.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Come in, Enterprise.<br> Enterprise.<br> Lieutenant Uhura.<br> - Captain here.<br> Put McCoy on.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Captain, we're not reading you well.<br> You're nine points into the low frequency band.<br> We're having difficulty.<br> Patch historical computer into uniform section.<br> I want McCoy outfitted as a Gestapo doctor, Nazi Germany, old Earth date 1944.<br> Make him a colonel.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Search the building.<br> What have you got, Jim? We found John Gill.<br> At least we've seen him.<br> He may be drugged, hypnotised or psychotic.<br> You'll have to make a determination.<br> Hurry with that uniform.<br> - What is it? - Isak just heard two security men.<br> They picked up your broadcast and pinpointed it within this building.<br> - They're starting to search.<br> - If there's gonna be a delay in transporting the doctor, I suggest we cancel our Kirk to Enterprise.<br> What's happening? Dr.<br> McCoy is having difficulty with that uniform, sir.<br> Well, send him down naked if you have to.<br> Kirk out.<br> It's true.<br> I only half believed what you said.<br> Stupid computer made a mistake in the measurements.<br> The right boot's too tight.<br> There is a logical way to proceed, doctor.<br> You point your toe, apply equal pressure to either side of the boot, and push.<br> We have no time for emotionalism.<br> This is Dr.<br> McCoy, our chief medical officer.<br> Daras, secretary to the National Socialist Party.<br> How do you do? What in blazes is this? Chairman Eneg.<br> The colonel is drunk.<br> He's had a little too much to drink.<br> I see.<br> Yes, he thought he would embarrass the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> Yes, a doctor should have more pride.<br> You were right to conceal him.<br> There's a spy in this building with a secret transmitter.<br> We're conducting a search.<br> - Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> - Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> Well, captain, I do not understand how he failed to recognise us.<br> Nor do I.<br> But luck is something you also fail to recognise, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> True.<br> I shall reconsider.<br> The FÃÂ¼hrer's speech.<br> Let's go.<br> Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Ekosians  the job ahead is difficult.<br> It requires courage and dedication.<br> It requires faith.<br> The Zeon colony has existed for nearly half a century.<br> Watch his mouth.<br> If we fulfill our own greatness  that will all be ended.<br> - Working together - Captain, - the speech follows no logical pattern.<br> - Random sentences strung together.<br> He looks drugged, Jim.<br> Almost in a cataleptic state.<br> - To reach our goal.<br> And we will reach that goal.<br> I'd like to have to have a close look at him.<br> Every action we take must be decisive.<br> Every thought directed toward a goal.<br> This planet can become a paradise, if we are willing to pay the price.<br> As each cell in the body works with discipline and harmony for the good of the entire being Gentlemen, I want a picture of you two with the hero of the Fatherland listening to the stirring FÃÂ¼hrer's speech.<br> Place that light over here, please.<br> Get this light around here.<br> Smile, gentlemen, smile.<br> Turn around, smile and now - Locked.<br> - Keys.<br> Hail, FÃÂ¼hrer! - Hail FÃÂ¼hrer! - Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! The FÃÂ¼hrer has given us our orders.<br> And we pledge him our lives in this sacred task.<br> Death to Zeon.<br> Death to Zeon! Death to Zeon! Death to Zeon! Death to Zeon! - Definitely drugged.<br> Almost comatose.<br> - What drug? I can't identify it without a medi-comp.<br> Without knowing, an antidote would be dangerous.<br> Is there anything you can do? I can give him a general stimulant, but it would be risky.<br> Take the risk.<br> But despite our best efforts, they remain like a cancer eating away at our state.<br> There's no reaction.<br> Whatever you gave him isn't working.<br> Bones, increase the dosage.<br> I'm working in the dark.<br> I could kill him.<br> If they find us here, we'll all be killed.<br> Ten minutes ago, on our FÃÂ¼hrer's orders, our troops began their historic mission.<br> In the cities, the eliminations have started.<br> Within an hour, the Zeon blight will forever be removed from Ekos.<br> It's begun.<br> It's finally begun.<br> Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! Hail the FÃÂ¼hrer! - The stimulant's working.<br> - I now announce He's reaching a level of consciousness.<br> It's almost like he's in a light sleep.<br> That's as much as I dare do.<br> Our entire solar system will forever be rid of the disease that was Zeon.<br> Spock, try to get through to him with the mind probe.<br> If you can't, Bones, you'll have to use a stronger stimulant no matter what it does.<br> Our space fleet is on its way toward Zeon with both manned and unmanned weapons.<br> This is the time of destiny.<br> - Hail victory! - Hail victory! Hail victory! Hail victory! There's one chance left.<br> If you'd use the weapons you have, you could destroy the fleet.<br> That would mean the death of thousands of Ekosian spacemen.<br> I know.<br> Many of my friends are aboard that ship.<br> - And many of the underground.<br> - Yes, but against those thousands are millions upon millions of innocent Zeon lives.<br> We've got to choose the lesser of two evils.<br> We could save Zeon.<br> - But what about Ekos? - Captain.<br> I've created a condition in which Gill cannot initiate speech or any other action, but he can reply to questions.<br> Well done, Spock.<br> They've kept what's left of him as a figurehead.<br> Quite correct.<br> For the last few years, the real power has been Melakon.<br> Gill.<br> Gill, why did you abandon your mission? Why did you interfere with this culture? Planet fragmented divided.<br> Took lesson from Earth history.<br> But why Nazi Germany? You studied history.<br> You knew what the Nazis were.<br> Most efficient state Earth ever knew.<br> Quite true, captain.<br> That tiny country, beaten, bankrupt, defeated, rose in a few years to stand only one step away from global domination.<br> But it was brutal, perverted.<br> It had to be destroyed at a terrible cost.<br> Why that example? Perhaps Gill felt that such a state, run benignly, could accomplish its efficiency without sadism.<br> Why, Gill? Why? Worked.<br> At first, it worked.<br> Then Melakon began takeover, used Gave me the drug.<br> Gill.<br> Gill.<br> Gill, can you hear me? You've got to tell those people what happened.<br> You're the only one who can prevent the slaughter.<br> Gill.<br> He's still alive, but the drug they use is too strong.<br> If I give him another shot - Bones, give him another shot.<br> - I don't dare! Guards.<br> We've run out of time, Bones.<br> Wait.<br> Aim it at Spock.<br> Spock, take off the helmet.<br> For the second time in one day, Daras is a hero to the Fatherland.<br> She captured a Zeon spy that was attempting to assassinate the FÃÂ¼hrer.<br> Guards.<br> Yes, let us make an example of this traitor, once and for all.<br> We'll make a present of him to Melakon.<br> Chairman Eneg, this spy must be taken to Melakon.<br> Pass them on my responsibility.<br> Eneg is one of us.<br> Stick close to Spock.<br> Stall for time.<br> And hope.<br> - What is this? - A spy, Excellency.<br> A rare prize.<br> The Deputy FÃÂ¼hrer can see this is no ordinary Zeon.<br> Not a Zeon.<br> Definitely not.<br> Professor Gill.<br> Can you hear me? You've got to speak.<br> You've got to speak.<br> This is our last chance.<br> Gill.<br> The Deputy FÃÂ¼hrer is an authority on the genetics of racial purity.<br> How would you classify this one? Very difficult.<br> Note the sinister eyes and the malformed ears.<br> Definitely an inferior race.<br> Professor.<br> Professor, you've got to talk.<br> You've gotta tell them what happened.<br> You've got to come out of it.<br> Come on, professor, come on.<br> Come on.<br> Note the low forehead, denoting stupidity.<br> The dull look of a trapped animal.<br> You may take him now for interrogation.<br> But I want the body saved for the Cultural Museum.<br> He'll make an interesting display.<br> People People  of Ekos.<br> Go to the booth.<br> See to the FÃÂ¼hrer at once.<br> He's ill.<br> Turn off that camera.<br> Hear me.<br> I suggest we leave and let our FÃÂ¼hrer rest.<br> We were betrayed by a self-seeking adventurer  who has led us all to the very brink of disaster.<br> I order the immediate recall of the space fleet.<br> This attack must stop.<br> All units are to return to base.<br> To Zeon, I promise this was not an aggression of the Ekosian people only one evil man.<br> Melakon is a traitor to his own people  and to all that we stand for.<br> To the Zeon people  I promise reparation.<br> Wait, soldier.<br> There's been enough killing.<br> Now we'll start to live the way the FÃÂ¼hrer meant us to live.<br> I was wrong.<br> The Non-lnterference Directive is the only way.<br> We must stop the slaughter.<br> You did that, professor.<br> You told them in time.<br> Even historians fail to learn from history.<br> They repeat the same mistakes.<br> Let the killing end.<br> Let Is he dead, captain? Dead.<br> For so long, I've prayed for this.<br> - Now I'm sorry.<br> - So was he.<br> - You've given us all a new chance.<br> - Thank you.<br> But go now.<br> We must do the rest.<br> Eneg and I will go on the air, offer a new way for our people for all our people both Zeons and Ekosians.<br> It is time to stop the bloodshed, to bury our dead.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock, I think the planet is in good hands.<br> Indeed, captain.<br> With the union of two cultures, this system would make a fine addition to the Federation.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise here, captain.<br> Beam us aboard.<br> Captain, I never will understand humans.<br> How could a man as brilliant, a mind as logical as John Gill's have made such a fatal error? He drew the wrong conclusion from history.<br> The problem with the Nazis wasn't simply that their leaders were evil, psychotic men.<br> They were.<br> But the main problem, I think, was the leader principle.<br> What he's saying, Spock, is that a man who holds that much power, even with the best intentions, just can't resist the urge to play God.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> I was able to gather the meaning.<br> It also proves another Earth saying: Absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br> Darn clever these Earthmen, wouldn't you say? Yes.<br> Earthmen like Ramses, Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan.<br> Your whole Earth history is made up of men seeking absolute power.<br> - Now, Spock, you obviously don't - Obviously, doctor, you fail to accept Gentlemen, we've just been through one civil war.<br> Let's not start another.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, take us out of orbit.<br> Warp factor 2, and hurry.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Captain, I'm getting a reading now.<br> Two human forms at bearing 300, mark 7.<br> Confirmed.<br> I'm Captain James T.<br> Kirk of the starship Enterprise.<br> We came in answer to your distress call.<br> It was very kind of you to respond so quickly, captain.<br> Now you will surrender your ship to me.<br> You have a very strange sense of humour, Mr I am Rojan, of Kelva.<br> I am your commander from this moment on.<br> Any efforts to resist us or to escape will be severely punished.<br> Soon we and you will leave this galaxy forever.<br> You humans must face the end of your existence as you have known it.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> You are all paralysed by a selective field that neutralizes nerve impulses to the voluntary muscles.<br> We can control you at will.<br> I will now release you.<br> - Shea.<br> - Captain.<br> - It's all right.<br> - Interesting.<br> A neural field? Yes, radiating from a central projector.<br> - What do you want? - Your ship, Captain Kirk.<br> It will serve us well in the long voyage that is to come.<br> - Voyage? Where? - To your neighbouring galaxy, which you call Andromeda.<br> Andromeda? Why? It is our home.<br> What brings you here? Within ten millennia, high radiation levels in our galaxy will make life there impossible.<br> So the Kelvan Empire sent forth ships to explore other galaxies, to search for one which our race could conquer and occupy.<br> Well, sorry, this galaxy is already occupied.<br> Captain, you think you are unconquerable, and your ship impregnable.<br> But while we've talked, the capture has already begun.<br> Something penetrating from the planet.<br> Increase power to shields.<br> It's dead, sir.<br> All major power disabled.<br> Sound red alert.<br> Red alert! All personnel, man your battle stations.<br> Go to red alert! - Engineering, come in! - Life Support, come in.<br> Drea, Tomar, report.<br> Life Support Control, secure.<br> Engineering is secure.<br> Rojan.<br> Hanar here.<br> - Report, Hanar.<br> - The ship is ours.<br> We control the Bridge, Engineering, and life-support systems.<br> Proceed with your orders.<br> What's the point in capturing my ship? Even at maximum warp, the Enterprise can't get to Andromeda for thousands of years.<br> Captain, we will modify its engines in order to produce velocities far beyond the reach of your science.<br> The journey between galaxies will take less than Fascinating.<br> Intergalactic travel requiring only 300 years.<br> That is a leap far beyond anything man has yet accomplished.<br> You made a voyage of 300 years? Our ships were of multi-generation design.<br> We were born in the intergalactic void.<br> We shall die there during our return journey.<br> And our mission will be completed by a commander who is my descendant.<br> What happened to your ship? There is an energy barrier at the rim of your galaxy.<br> Yes, I know, we've been there.<br> We managed to break through it with great difficulty.<br> Our ship was destroyed.<br> We barely managed to escape in a life craft.<br> And now we have the means to begin our journey back to Andromeda.<br> Why use our vessel? Why not transmit a message to your galaxy? No form of transmission can penetrate the barrier.<br> Rojan, there's no reason to do this by force.<br> Let's take your problem to the Federation.<br> Research expeditions have catalogued hundreds of uninhabited planets in this galaxy suitable for colonization.<br> We do not colonise.<br> We conquer.<br> We rule.<br> There is no other way for us.<br> In other words, the galaxy isn't big enough for both of us.<br> The Federation has handled foreign invasions before.<br> Captain, we can control the Federation as easily as we can control you.<br> The fate of the inferior, in any galaxy.<br> All is proceeding according to plan, Rojan.<br> Kelinda, take them to the holding area.<br> We'll keep you and your party here, captain.<br> Your crew will undoubtedly wish to cooperate with us if they understand that you are hostages.<br> Move there.<br> Tomar has examined the ship.<br> The modifications are underway.<br> Space again, Hanar.<br> I do not think we could have kept our sanity living too long on this accursed planet.<br> It is an undisciplined environment.<br> One cannot control it.<br> Yet there are things of interest.<br> Yes, but disturbing.<br> These shells in which we have encased ourselves, they have such heightened senses.<br> To feel, to hear, to smell.<br> How do humans manage to exist in these fragile cases? Since the ship was designed to sustain these forms, we have little choice.<br> At least we'll be away from all of this openness.<br> No, this is too strange for us, Hanar.<br> We are creatures of outer space.<br> Soon, we will be safe in the comforting closeness of walls.<br> Fascinating material.<br> Similar to diburnium, but considerably more dense.<br> I doubt even phaser fire could disturb its molecular structure.<br> All right, we can't break out.<br> There must be another way.<br> Captain, what do they want from us? What kind of people are they? - That's a very good question.<br> - They registered as human.<br> No, doctor, more than that.<br> They registered as perfect human life forms.<br> I recall noting the readings were almost classic textbook responses.<br> - Most curious.<br> - Spock, what are the odds, in such absolute duplication, of life forms in another galaxy? The chances are very much against it.<br> Captain.<br> Captain.<br> However perfect they are, there don't seem to be very many of them.<br> - Why don't we.<br>.<br>? - They have the paralysis field.<br> Rojan mentioned something about a central projector.<br> Yes.<br> If we could put that out of operation, we might have a chance.<br> Gentleman, I am constrained to point out we do not even know what this projector looks like.<br> Those devices on their belts might indicate the source of the force field.<br> Possible.<br> I would have to have one to examine.<br> Oh, you'll have one, sir.<br> If I have to rip one of the Kelvans apart to get it.<br> You'll get your chance, but you'll do it under orders.<br> Yes, sir.<br> On Eminiar Vll you were able to trick the guard by a Vulcan mind probe.<br> Yes, I recall, captain.<br> I led him to believe we had escaped.<br> Do you think you can do it again? I shall attempt it.<br> - You all right? - Yes, I will be all right, captain.<br> But we must hurry.<br> This cannot go unpunished.<br> Hanar.<br> That one.<br> Take him aside.<br> Kelinda, the female.<br> Captain.<br> Go.<br> As a leader, you realise the importance of discipline.<br> I need you and these other specialists.<br> But those two are unnecessary.<br> I'm responsible, let them go.<br> I think we're somewhat alike, captain.<br> Each of us cares less for his own safety than for the lives of his command.<br> We feel pain when others suffer for our mistakes.<br> Your punishment shall be to watch them die.<br> Captain.<br> Proceed, Hanar.<br> Bring them to me.<br> This is the essence of what they were.<br> The flesh and brain and what you call the personality, distilled down into these compact shapes.<br> Once crushed this person is dead.<br> However that one can be restored.<br> Hanar.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4657.<br>5.<br> Work is proceeding on the Enterprise as my crew is forced to make the required changes in the ship for intergalactic travel.<br> I can't forget the picture of Yeoman Thompson crushed to a handful of dust.<br> Spock, are you sure you're all right? Yes, quite all right, doctor.<br> You didn't look very well when you broke that mind touch.<br> I did not break it, doctor.<br> I was thrown away by something I've never experienced before.<br> What was it? A series of bizarre and exotic images bursting on my mind and consciousness.<br> Colours, shapes, mathematical equations, fused and blurred.<br> I've been attempting to isolate them, but so far, I've been able to recall clearly only one.<br> Immense beings, a hundred limbs which resemble tentacles, minds of such controlling capacity that each limb is capable of performing a different function.<br> Do you mean that's what the Kelvans really are? Undoubtedly.<br> If they look that way normally, why did they adapt themselves to our bodies? Perhaps practicality.<br> They chose the Enterprise as the best vessel for the trip.<br> Immense beings with 100 tentacles would have difficulty with the turbolift.<br> We've got to stop them.<br> We outnumber them.<br> Their only hold on us is the paralysis field.<br> Well, that's enough.<br> One wrong move and they jam all our neural circuits.<br> Jam.<br> Spock, if you reverse the circuits on McCoy's neuro-analyser, can you set up a counter field to jam the paralysis projector? I am dubious of the possibilities of success, captain.<br> The medical equipment is not designed to put out a great deal of power.<br> The polarised elements would burn out quickly.<br> Is there a chance at all? - A small one.<br> - We'll take it.<br> You and Bones have to get up to the ship.<br> - How? - Yes.<br> Mr.<br> Spock you're sick.<br> I assure you, captain, I'm in perfect health.<br> No, you're not.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy's given you a thorough examination and you're ill.<br> In fact, if you don't get to the Sickbay, you're gonna die.<br> It's a good idea, Jim, but anyone looking at him can tell he's healthy.<br> Vulcans have the ability to place themselves in a kind of trance.<br> Complete relaxation of every part of the mind and body.<br> We find it more restful to the body than your so-called vacation.<br> Can you do it now, and come out of it in the Sickbay, say, in half an hour? It will take me a moment to prepare.<br> Go ahead.<br> Jim, his heartbeat really is slow.<br> His pulse is practically nonexistent.<br> Hanar! Hanar.<br> What do you want, human? Mr.<br> Spock is ill.<br> The doctor thinks he may be dying.<br> This illness came on him rather suddenly.<br> Is it not unusual? He's a Vulcan.<br> They don't react like humans.<br> He may die.<br> If I can get him up to Sickbay, there's a chance he'll live.<br> Stand away from the door.<br> I will have you beamed aboard.<br> Do what you can with him, Bones.<br> - Doctor, what happened? - Prepare two cc's of Stokaline.<br> - Stokaline? But, doctor, that - Don't argue, nurse, just get it.<br> This may be the turning point.<br> Prepare another shot.<br> - But, doc - Please, just follow orders, will you? There, that should do it.<br> Just let him rest now.<br> You see, it's a flare-up of Rigelian Kassaba fever.<br> He suffered from it about ten years ago, and it recurs every now and then.<br> There's no danger if he gets medication in time.<br> He'll be all right in a couple of hours.<br> Very well.<br> I will inform Rojan.<br> You will stay here.<br> What do you want from me now? We will beam aboard the vessel shortly.<br> I wish you to understand your duties.<br> My duty is to stop you in any way I can.<br> - You will obey.<br> - Or you will kill more of my people.<br> Captain Kirk, I cannot believe that you do not understand the importance of my mission.<br> We Kelvans have a code of honour.<br> Harsh, demanding.<br> It calls for much from us, and much from those whom we conquer.<br> You have been conquered.<br> I respect your devotion to your duty, but I cannot permit it to interfere with mine.<br> These are lovely.<br> Captain Kirk, what is it you call them? Flowers.<br> I don't know the variety.<br> Our memory tapes tell us of such things on Kelvan.<br> Crystals that form with such rapidity they seem to grow.<br> They look like this fragile thing somewhat.<br> We call them sahsheer.<br> A rose by any other name.<br> Captain? A quote from a great human poet, Shakespeare.<br> That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.<br> Drea has computed and laid a course for Kelva, captain.<br> We've jumped to warp 8.<br> And we'll go faster yet.<br> Increase speed to warp 11.<br> Increase speed to warp 11, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> On course and proceeding as planned.<br> We will approach the barrier within an hour.<br> Very well.<br> Rojan, I'm going to Sickbay, my first officer has taken ill.<br> Yes, I was informed.<br> You may go.<br> - Anything? - I've located their power source.<br> It's installed in Engineering.<br> We're just going to jam it.<br> I've tied in all the lab computers.<br> That'll give it a bit more power to push with.<br> This is it.<br> Now all we have to do Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible.<br> Why? This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet.<br> Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons.<br> We cannot penetrate the casing to get to the machine.<br> That's it, then.<br> There is one other possibility, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> The final decision, of course, must be the captain's, but I believe we must have it ready for him.<br> The Enterprise is propelled by matter-antimatter reactors.<br> The barrier we must traverse is negative energy.<br> I see what you're getting at.<br> - I can't say I like it.<br> - Nor I.<br> But it must be made available to the captain.<br> Captain Kirk to the Bridge, please.<br> Well? Impossible, captain.<br> The power source is protected by a material we cannot breach, even with our phasers.<br> Mr.<br> Scott and I have prepared the means for the only logical alternative available to us.<br> What alternative? The barrier we must penetrate is composed of negative energy.<br> I have opened the control valves to the matter-antimatter nacelles.<br> On your signal, I will flood them with positive energy.<br> What? When we engage the barrier, the ship will explode.<br> The Kelvans will be stopped here.<br> And so will we.<br> Are you mad? I can't just Take your places, gentlemen, we're approaching the barrier.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4658.<br>9.<br> With the Enterprise under control of the Kelvans, we are approaching the energy barrier at the edge of our galaxy.<br> Spock and Scotty have devised a suicide plan to stop the Kelvans.<br> They have rigged this ship to explode on my signal.<br> Readings, Spock.<br> Sensors indicate density negative, radiation negative, energy negative.<br> All instruments off the dial, captain.<br> We are in contact with the barrier.<br> Outside hull temperature rising, sir.<br> Over 2,000 degrees now.<br> Sir? Hold your position.<br> We made it.<br> Instruments returning to normal, captain.<br> All decks report, damage and casualties.<br> Several systems out, sir, operating on emergency backup.<br> None affect flight procedure.<br> Life support systems sustaining on emergency.<br> I'll have a full report on ship's status for you in a moment, sir.<br> Your people are most efficient, captain.<br> Thank you.<br> So are yours.<br> Hanar, start the neutralising operation.<br> What neutralising operation? You humans are troublesome for us.<br> We needed you to get us through the barrier.<br> But there aren't enough of us to efficiently guard all of you all of the time.<br> Further, the food synthesizers cannot manufacture enough food for the entire journey.<br> We are therefore neutralising all non-essential personnel.<br> No.<br> The procedure is already under way.<br> Now, as to Bridge personnel Drea.<br> We have no need for communication.<br> And since Drea is capable of handling the ship from here on Do you not agree that this is a better thing for them than exploding the ship, as your engineer had thought to do? We detected it, of course.<br> Tomar has devised a mechanism to prevent any further tampering.<br> Please accept your situation, captain.<br> It will make things much less painful for you.<br> Is this all? I have reviewed ship's personnel, captain.<br> It appears we four are the only ones the Kelvans consider essential.<br> Scotty tells me that you could have destroyed the ship in the barrier.<br> - Why didn't you? - I couldn't.<br> - If that was our only chance - I didn't think it was.<br> - Jim - That's enough! Jim, I saw them reduce four of my doctors and nurses - into those little cubes.<br> - They've reduced the whole crew! I do not understand why you take the trouble to consume this bulk material to sustain yourselves.<br> We have ascertained that these contain all the nutritional elements.<br> Before you condemn it, why don't you try it? I believe I will.<br> Assist me.<br> It's your idea, doctor, go ahead.<br> All right, I'll show you how to work the selector.<br> Sir, why don't we try again to knock out the paralysis projector? I know the casing looks impenetrable, but I may be able to do something.<br> It's out of the question.<br> We need that projector to bring our people back to human form.<br> Then how will we stop the Kelvans? Captain.<br> It's quite good.<br> I'm delighted.<br> Most curious.<br> What is? The isolated glimpses of things I saw when I touched Kelinda's mind are beginning to coalesce in my consciousness.<br> The Kelvans have superior intellectual capacity.<br> To achieve it, they've apparently sacrificed anything which would tend to distract them.<br> Perceptive senses such as taste, touch, smell, and, of course, emotions.<br> But then, Tomar shouldn't be enjoying the taste of his food.<br> Yes, quite correct, captain.<br> But they have taken human form, and are therefore having human reaction.<br> If he keeps reacting like that, he's gonna need a diet.<br> If they all respond to stimulation of the senses, then maybe we can distract them.<br> They can't have been able to handle the senses yet.<br> If we can confuse them enough, we can get those devices from their belts.<br> - It seems reasonable.<br> - All right.<br> It may be our only chance.<br> Look for any way to stimulate their senses.<br> I can think of one way right off.<br> Lad, you're going to need something to wash that down with.<br> Have you ever tried any Saurian brandy? I don't know about that.<br> Please articulate.<br> Well, that body of yours is a bit anaemic.<br> Comes from taking food in pills, instead of solid sustenance.<br> - What are you doing? - Gonna give you a shot.<br> High-potency vitamin concentrate.<br> You'll need three a day for a few days.<br> And eat some solid food, will you? No more? Am I disturbing you? What is it you wish? I wish to apologise.<br> I don't understand, captain.<br> For hitting you.<br> I'm sorry.<br> That is not necessary.<br> You attempted to escape, as we would have.<br> Yes, well, I don't usually go around beating up beautiful women.<br> Why not? Well, there are better things for men and women to do.<br> Like what? Is this where I hit you? No, the other side.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Is that better? Better? Was it intended as a remedy? This is.<br> Is there some significance to this action? Well, among humans, it's meant to express warmth and love.<br> Oh, you are trying to seduce me.<br> I have been studying you.<br> - Me? - All humans.<br> This business of love.<br> You have devoted much literature to it.<br> Why do you build such a mystique around a simple biological function? - We enjoy it.<br> - Literature? Kelinda, I'm sorry I brought up the whole subject.<br> Do you really regard this touching of the lips as pleasurable? - I did.<br> - Curious.<br> Let me try.<br> Is there some problem, captain? Not when I came in.<br> What did he want here? He came to apologise for hitting me.<br> Apparently, it involves some peculiar touching contact.<br> In what manner? Very odd creatures, these humans.<br> Do you have more? Not of this.<br> Anything.<br> Yes, humans are very peculiar.<br> I often find them unfathomable, but an interesting psychological study.<br> Well, I do not understand this business of pressing with the lips to apologise.<br> I believe you are referring to a kiss.<br> But it is my understanding that such apologies are usually exchanged between people who have some affection for each other.<br> Kelinda has no affection for Captain Kirk.<br> Your game is off.<br> Are you disturbed by the incident? Why should I be disturbed? You've known Kelinda for some time.<br> She is a Kelvan as you are.<br> Among humans, I have found the symptoms you are displaying usually indicate jealousy.<br> I have no reason for such a reaction.<br> Kelinda is a female.<br> Nothing more.<br> Captain Kirk seems to find her quite attractive.<br> Well, of course she is.<br> - You are not jealous.<br> - No.<br> - Nor upset.<br> - Certainly not.<br> Checkmate.<br> I found this on What is it? Well, it's It's green.<br> - Kelinda, I've been thinking.<br> - Yes? I do not wish you to fraternize with any of the humans.<br> - Why not? - Well, they They offer such strange ideas.<br> They're not meant for us.<br> Not for Kelvans.<br> Have you given this order to the others? No.<br> And I wish you to particularly avoid Captain Kirk.<br> I will not.<br> You have told me over and over again humans are no threat to us.<br> We are superior.<br> I will do as I please.<br> You will do as I say.<br> Or I will neutralise your Captain Kirk and all the other humans as well.<br> How many more of these? Well, now, let's see.<br> You've had three shots.<br> I think you better stay on them for a few days, and then we'll see how you respond.<br> I see no reason for you to refer to yourself in the plural.<br> You have more? All I have is a bottle of very, very, very old Scotch.<br> Whisky! - Well, I will try it! - I'll get it! - I was saving you for - What? Never mind.<br> Give us your glass.<br> The thing is, I can't tell if we're getting anywhere.<br> I haven't seen Scotty in hours.<br> We haven't seen Tomar either.<br> But my man Hanar is getting more irritable by the minute.<br> I'm giving him shots of Formazine.<br> It should have him climbing the walls.<br> Rojan has exhibited symptoms of jealousy.<br> I would like to speak with you, captain.<br> Doctor, I'm due for another injection of Stokaline.<br> Stokaline.<br> You will pardon us.<br> - You had something to say? - Yes.<br> This cultural mystique surrounding the biological function Yes? You realise humans are overly preoccupied with the subject.<br> Yes, we do think a great deal about it.<br> I've done some supplemental reading on it, and You have a question? Yes, I was wondering, would you please apologise to me again? - Rojan, I want to talk to you.<br> - Very well.<br> First, I do not like the way responsibility and duty has been portioned out to us.<br> - It's the way it has always been - That is my second quarrel with you.<br> Further, I do not care much for the way you run this ship.<br> Hanar, confine yourself to your quarters! Rojan has forbidden me to see you.<br> Yes, that's too bad.<br> Why do you defy him? It's not a question of defiance.<br> We were told to find out everything we could about you.<br> And how's the research going? I need some more experiments.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you were not ordered to the Bridge, what is your purpose here? Automatic sensors and various other recording devices require monitoring and periodic adjustments.<br> Very well, proceed.<br> Have you seen Captain Kirk? If you wish, I shall call him to the Bridge.<br> No.<br> I was wondering where he was.<br> I left him in the Recreation Room.<br> - He was alone, then.<br> - No.<br> Kelinda was with him.<br> She seemed anxious to speak to him.<br> I told her to stay away from him.<br> It would appear, sir, that you have little control over her.<br> Or perhaps Captain Kirk has more.<br> Very interesting.<br> But I feel rather strange.<br> We did it.<br> You and me.<br> Put him right under the table.<br> I'll take this to the captain.<br> Kelinda, I told you to avoid this human.<br> I did not wish to.<br> I am your commander.<br> That's not enough, Rojan.<br> You did this to her.<br> Corrupted her.<br> Turned her away from me.<br> If you can't keep her, that's not my problem.<br> You will release her.<br> Why don't you use your paralyser? You thought I was taking your woman away from you.<br> You're jealous.<br> You tried to kill me with your bare hands.<br> Would a Kelvan do that? Would he have to? You're reacting with the emotions of a human.<br> You are human.<br> No, I cannot be.<br> I'm stimulating him.<br> You have no choice.<br> To use this ship, you have to use our form.<br> Now you're stuck with it, you and your descendants, for the next 300 years.<br> You fool, these bodies are tools.<br> We remain Kelvan.<br> Look what happened in the short time you've been exposed to us.<br> What do you think will happen in three centuries? When this ship gets to Kelva the people on it will be human.<br> They'll be aliens.<br> Enemies! We have a duty, our mission, to accomplish any way we can.<br> Your mission is to find new worlds for your people to live in.<br> You can still do that.<br> We can bring this problem to the Federation.<br> There are many planets in this galaxy that can be inhabited.<br> You would really do that? You would extend welcome to invaders? No.<br> But we would welcome friends.<br> Rojan, you were only a link in a chain, following an order given 300 years ago.<br> This is an opportunity for you to establish a destiny of your own.<br> Perhaps.<br> Perhaps it could be done.<br> A robot ship could be sent to Kelva with the Federation proposal.<br> But if we retain this form, where could we find a place? Seems to me that little planet you were on is kind of nice.<br> And you you would wish to remain with him? He is most interesting.<br> But I wish to go with you.<br> I believe I owe you an apology.<br> It was most pleasurable.<br> Yes.<br> Very curious.<br> You see, Rojan, being human does have certain advantages, of being able to appreciate the beauty of a flower or a woman.<br> Bridge, this is Rojan.<br> Yes, commander? I am returning command of this ship to Captain Kirk.<br> You will follow his orders.<br> Sir? Turn the ship around.<br> We're going home.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

The helm was left on automatic, sir.<br> Fascinating.<br> Spock, play the last log tape.<br> Maybe they had time to record what happened to them.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Jim, the analysis of this so far is potassium 35 percent, carbon 18 percent, phosphorus 1.<br>0, calcium 1.<br>5.<br> Jim, the crew didn't leave.<br> They're still here.<br> What do you mean? These white crystals.<br> That's what's left of the human body when you take the water away, which makes up 96 percent of our bodies.<br> Without water, we're all just Something crystallised them down to this.<br> I have their surgeon's log, captain.<br> Their last log entry, captain, on-screen.<br> If If you've come aboard this ship  you're dead men.<br> Don't go back to your own ship.<br> You have one chance.<br> Get down there.<br> Get down there fast.<br> Captain Tracey is Prepare to beam down to the planet's surface, fast.<br> Put the axe away, Liyang.<br> That's Ron Tracey.<br> Ron.<br> I knew someone would come looking for us.<br> I'm just sorry it had to be you, Jim.<br> I'm glad your arrival stopped this.<br> No more of this, Wu.<br> Lock up the savages.<br> - They carry fire boxes.<br> - I said, lock up the savages.<br> The prisoners are called Yangs.<br> Impossible even to communicate with.<br> Hordes of them out there.<br> They'll attack anything that moves.<br> Interesting that the villagers know about phasers.<br> You were left alone down here, Ron.<br> What happened? Our metascanners revealed this planet as perfectly harmless.<br> The villagers, the Kohms here, were friendly enough once they got over the shock of my white skin.<br> As you've seen, we resemble the Yangs, the savages.<br> My landing party transported back to the ship.<br> I stayed down here to arrange for the planet survey with the village elders.<br> The next thing I knew, the ship was calling me.<br> The landing party had taken an unknown disease back.<br> - My crew, Jim.<br> My entire crew gone.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> We saw it.<br> And I'm just as infected as they were.<br> As you are.<br> But I stayed alive because I stayed down here.<br> There's some natural immunization that protects everyone on the planet's surface.<br> I don't know what it is.<br> Lucky we found that log report.<br> If we'd gone back to the Enterprise You'd be dying by now, along with the rest of the Enterprise crew.<br> You'll stay alive only as long as you stay here.<br> None of us will ever leave this planet.<br> Captain's log, supplemental.<br> The Enterprise has left the Exeter and has moved into close planet orbit.<br> Although it appears the infection may strand us here the rest of our lives, I face an even more difficult problem: The growing belief that Captain Tracey has been interfering with the evolution of life on this planet.<br> It seems impossible.<br> A Star captain's most solemn oath is that he will give his life, even his entire crew, rather than violate the Prime Directive.<br> Tell the lab the final reading on our tissue is Y3X.<br>004.<br> And I can use a second blood-analyser unit.<br> We'll beam it down shortly, doctor.<br> Enterprise out.<br> Our tissues definitely show a massive infection, Jim.<br> But something is immunizing us down here, thank heavens, or we'd have been dead hours ago.<br> I don't think we're gonna have time to isolate it, Bones.<br> The problem is it could be anything.<br> Some spores, or pollen in the air, some chemical.<br> Just finding it could take months, maybe even years.<br> And I've only got one lead.<br> The infection resembles one developed by Earth during their bacteriological-warfare experiments in the 1990s.<br> Hard to believe we were once foolish enough to play around with that.<br> The Yang lance, doctor.<br> - You all right? - Bruised only.<br> We were approximately when five of the savages ambushed us.<br> We managed to escape without firing.<br> Spock, do you see any hope that these Yangs can be reasoned with? - A truce, a parley, a - No, captain.<br> They're too wild.<br> They act almost insane.<br> Captain Tracey is being quite factual in several statements.<br> One, the Yangs are totally contemptuous of death.<br> They seem incredibly vicious.<br> Two, he is also being factual in that the Yangs are massing for an attack.<br> There are signs of thousands of them in the foothills beyond.<br> However, he was less than truthful in one very important matter.<br> Phaser power packs.<br> Captain Tracey's reserve belt packs.<br> Empty.<br> Found among the remains of several hundred Yang bodies.<br> Fool.<br> A smaller attack on this village a week ago, driven off by Captain Tracey with his phaser.<br> I have found villagers who will corroborate it.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> He lost his ship and his crew.<br> And then he found himself the only thing standing between an entire village of pleasant, peaceful people Regulations are quite harsh, but they are also quite clear, captain.<br> If you do not act, you will be considered equally guilty.<br> Without a serum, we're trapped here with the villagers.<br> Now, why destroy what's left of the man by arresting him? I agree that formal charges have little meaning now.<br> However, you must at least confiscate his phaser.<br> The fool.<br> Starfleet should be made aware I'll be sending the next message, Jim.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Enterprise Bridge, Lieutenant Uhura.<br> Captain Tracey of the Exeter.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain Kirk informed us earlier you had survived.<br> I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.<br> Your captain and landing party must have beamed down too late for full immunization.<br> They've been found unconscious, but I am doing everything I can for them now.<br> Sir, this is Lieutenant Sulu, in temporary command of the Enterprise.<br> Our whole medical staff will volunteer to beam down.<br> There is no point in risking more lives, lieutenant.<br> Since I have acquired some immunity, perhaps the others Sulu! At their next word, kill him.<br> Repeat your message.<br> Come in, landing party.<br> Repeat your message.<br> I am sorry, lieutenant.<br> Your captain's feverish, quite delirious.<br> I understand, sir.<br> When he regains consciousness, assure him that we have no problems here.<br> I'll contact you later, let you know of any future needs.<br> Landing party out.<br> That's enough of that, captain.<br> Leave us.<br> Captain Ronald Tracey, as per Starfleet Command Regulation 7, Paragraph 4 I must now consider myself under arrest, unless in the presence of the most senior fellow officers presently available I give satisfactory answer to those charges which you now bring, et cetera, et cetera.<br> Those were the first words duty required you to say to me, and you've said them.<br> You're covered.<br> Now, suppose we go on to the next subject? Which is why? Good.<br> Direct, succinct.<br> Answer: No native to this planet has ever had any trace of any kind of disease.<br> How long would a man live if all disease were erased, Jim? Wu.<br> Tell Captain Kirk your age.<br> Age? I have seen 42 years of the red bird.<br> My eldest brother Their year of the red bird comes once every 11 years, which he's seen 42 times.<br> Multiply it.<br> Wu is 462 years old.<br> His father is well over 1,000.<br> Interested, Jim? McCoy could verify all that.<br> He will, if you order it.<br> We must have a doctor researching this.<br> Are you grasping all it means? This immunizing agent here, once we've found it, is a fountain of youth.<br> Virtual immortality, or as much as any man will ever want.<br> For sale by Out.<br> By those who own the serum.<br> McCoy will eventually isolate it.<br> Meanwhile, you inform your ship your situation is impossible.<br> Order them away.<br> When we're ready, we'll bargain for a whole fleet of ships to pick us up.<br> And they'll do it.<br> Yes, I suppose they would.<br> But we've got to stay alive.<br> Let the Yangs kill us and destroy what we have to offer, and we'll have committed a crime against all humanity.<br> I'd say that's slightly more important than the Prime Directive, wouldn't you, Jim? It's a very interesting proposition.<br> Let me think it over.<br> Guards.<br> Take the doctor back to his workplace.<br> The pointed-eared one stays.<br> And, Wu, tell your men we'll be leaving soon.<br> We'll be in ambush for the Yangs, with many fire boxes this time.<br> What do you think of that, Jim? Animals who happen to look like us.<br> You still think the Prime Directive is for this planet? I don't think we have the right or the wisdom to interfere, however a planet is evolving.<br> Well, if logic won't work, perhaps this will.<br> Put him in there.<br> Don't they ever rest? Not that I have observed, captain.<br> Of course, should they wish to do so, one could always rest while the other keeps you occupied.<br> Thank you, Spock.<br> - Tell me why you want to kill me.<br> - Good.<br> Try to reason with them.<br> Keep trying, captain.<br> Their behaviour is highly illogical.<br> No point in repeating that it's illogical, Spock, I'm quite aware of it.<br> - Pity you can't teach me that.<br> - I have tried, captain.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Captain, I've managed to loosen this grille somewhat.<br> - If the mortar on yours is as old - I can't even get at it.<br> They'd be on me in a moment.<br> Keep talking, Spock.<br> Don't let me doze off.<br> Captain Tracey mentioned there was once a considerable civilisation here.<br> The only reasonable explanation would be a war, a nuclear devastation or a bacteriological holocaust.<br> That's a very interesting theory.<br> The yellow civilisation is almost destroyed.<br> The white civilisation is destroyed.<br> Keep working on the window, if we're ever gonna regain our freedom.<br> Freedom? Freedom? - Spock.<br> - Yes, I heard, captain.<br> That is a worship word, Yang worship.<br> You will not speak it.<br> Well, well, well.<br> It is our worship word too.<br> You live with the Kohms.<br> Am I not now a prisoner of the Kohms, as you are? Why did you not speak until now? You speak to Kohms.<br> You are only for killing.<br> Spock, we'll have you out in a minute.<br> Captain? Captain.<br> Captain, are you able to respond? Spock? Out for how long? Seven hours and eight minutes, captain.<br> Seven hours and eight Spock.<br> Keys.<br> I'll have you out in a minute.<br> - Oh, good morning, Jim.<br> - Good morning.<br> We can contact the ship in a few moments, captain, - if I can cross-circuit this unit.<br> - Good.<br> - Did you find out anything? - Yes.<br> I'm convinced that, once, there was a frightening biological war that existed here.<br> The virus still exists.<br> Then, over the years, nature built up these natural immunizing agents in the food, the water and the soil.<br> The war created an imbalance, and nature counterbalanced.<br> There is a disease here that affected the Exeter landing party and us.<br> That's right.<br> These immunizing agents take time.<br> And that's the real tragedy.<br> Had the Exeter landing party stayed here just a few hours longer, they never would have died.<br> Then we can leave anytime we want to.<br> Tracey is of the opinion that these immunizing agents can become a fountain of youth.<br> There are people here over 1,000 years old, Bones.<br> Survival of the fittest.<br> Because their ancestors, who survived, had to have a superior resistance.<br> Then they built up these powerful protective antibodies in the blood during the wars.<br> Now, if you want to destroy a civilisation or a whole world, perhaps your descendants might develop a longer life.<br> But I hardly think it's worth it.<br> Then anything you develop here as a result of all this is useless.<br> Who knows? It might eventually cure the common cold.<br> But lengthen lives? Poppycock.<br> I can do more for you if you just eat right and exercise regularly.<br> Ready, captain.<br> Quite crude.<br> Voice communication will not be possible, but we can signal the ship.<br> All that bloodshed for nothing.<br> That'll be sufficient, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No messages.<br> Kirk, the savage in the cell with you did you set him free? The savage, Kirk.<br> You sent him to warn the tribes.<br> The Yangs must have been warned.<br> They sacrificed hundreds just to draw us out in the open.<br> And then they came and they came.<br> We drained four of our phasers, and they still came.<br> We killed thousands, and they still came.<br> He'll live, but I'll have to get him to better facilities than this.<br> Impossible.<br> You can't carry the disease up to the ship with you.<br> He's fully immunized now.<br> We all are.<br> We can beam up at any time.<br> Any of us.<br> You've isolated the serum? There's no serum! There are no miracles! There's no immortality here! All this is for nothing! Explain it to him, doctor.<br> Leave medicine to medical men, captain.<br> You found no fountain of youth here.<br> People live longer here now because it's natural for them to.<br> Outside! Or I'll burn down both your friends now.<br> Do what you can for him, doctor.<br> - Where is everybody? - Dead or in hiding.<br> Now let's see how eager you are to die.<br> Call your ship.<br> I need your help, Kirk.<br> They're going to attack the village.<br> My phaser is almost drained.<br> We need new, fresh ones.<br> You're not gonna stand there and let them kill you.<br> If I put a weapon in your hand, you'll fight, won't you? We can beam up, Tracey.<br> All of us.<br> I want five phasers.<br> No, ten.<br> With three extra power packs each.<br> All right.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Captain.<br> Are you all right now? Yes, quite all right.<br> I'd like ten phasers beamed down with three extra power packs, please.<br> - Have you got that? - Say again.<br> Enterprise, do you read me? Captain, this is Sulu.<br> We read you.<br> But surely you know that can't be done without verification.<br> Not even if we're in danger, Mr.<br> Sulu? Captain, we have volunteers standing by to beam down.<br> - What is your situation? - The situation is not immediately dangerous.<br> Have the volunteers stand by.<br> Kirk out.<br> You have a well-trained Bridge crew, captain.<br> My compliments.<br> Spock? I am weak, captain, but not in difficulty.<br> He must have attention soon.<br> My need for attention is vital, doctor, but our need for departure is even more immediate.<br> If my ancestors were forced out of the cities, into the deserts, the hills Yes, I see, captain.<br> They would have learned to wear skins, adopted stoic mannerisms, learned the bow and the lance.<br> Living like Indians, finally even looking like the American Indian.<br> Ameri Yangs.<br> Yanks.<br> Spock, Yankees.<br> Kohms.<br> Communists.<br> The parallel is almost too close, captain.<br> It would mean they fought the war your Earth avoided.<br> And in this case, the Asiatics won and took over this planet.<br> But if it were true, all these generations of Yanks, fighting to regain their land You're a romantic, Jim.<br> That which is ours, is ours again.<br> It will never be taken from us again.<br> They can be handled, Jim.<br> Together it'll be easy.<br> I caution you, gentlemen, don't fight me here.<br> I'll win.<br> Or, at worst, I'll drag you down with me.<br> I am Cloud William, Chief, also Son of Chief, Guardian of the Holies, Speaker of the Holy Words, leader of warriors.<br> Many have died but this is the last of the Kohm places.<br> What is ours, is ours again.<br> And to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.<br> He spoke the holy word.<br> You know many of our high-worship words.<br> - How? - In my land we have a tribe like you.<br> - Where is your tribe? - Up there.<br> One of those points of light that you see at night.<br> Why are you here? Were you cast out? You're confusing the stars with heaven.<br> He was cast out.<br> Don't you recognise the Evil One? Who else would trick you with your own sacred words? Let your god strike me dead if I lie.<br> But he won't, because I speak for him.<br> Yet you killed many Yangs.<br> - You tried to kill me.<br> - We're not gods.<br> We're not evil ones.<br> We're men, like yourselves.<br> Would a man know your holy words? Could a man use them to trick you? See his servant his face, his eyes, his ears.<br> Do the Yang legends describe this servant of the Evil One? Are your faces alike? Can you tell from them which of you is good, and which of you is evil? You command him.<br> Everyone has seen that.<br> Do you want more proof? He has no heart.<br> His heart is different.<br> The internal organs of a Vulcan are Bring him.<br> He has no heart.<br> One of them lies.<br> But which? If we should kill the good, the evil would be among us.<br> There is a way.<br> The Greatest of Holies.<br> Chiefs and Sons of Chiefs may speak the words.<br> The Evil One's tongue would surely turn to fire.<br> I will begin you shall finish.<br> Those words are familiar.<br> Wait a moment.<br> He fears to speak them, for indeed his tongue would burn with fire.<br> Force him! Kill his servant unless he speaks, so that we may see if the words burn him.<br> No, wait! There's a better way.<br> Does not your sacred book promise that good is stronger than evil? Yes, it is written.<br> Good shall always destroy evil.<br> It is written.<br> The fight is done when one is dead.<br> Spock, I've found that evil usually triumphs, unless good is very, very careful.<br> - Spock, we've gotta do something.<br> - I'm open to suggestions, doctor.<br> What are you doing? I'm making a suggestion.<br> Kill him.<br> It is written: Good must destroy evil.<br> - We picked up communicator signals - We'll discuss that later, lieutenant.<br> Leslie, free Dr.<br> McCoy and Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Put Captain Tracey under arrest.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Well, Cloud William.<br> You are great God's servant.<br> We are your slaves.<br> Get up.<br> Face me.<br> When you would not say the holy words of the E'ed Plebnista, I doubted you.<br> I did not recognise those words.<br> You said them so badly without meaning.<br> No, only the eyes of a chief may see the E'ed Plebnista.<br> This was not written for chiefs.<br> Hear me.<br> Hear this.<br> Among my people, we carry many such words as this, from many lands, many worlds.<br> Many are equally good and are as well respected.<br> But wherever we have gone, no words have said this thing of importance in quite this way.<br> Look at these three words written larger than the rest with a special pride never written before or since.<br> Tall words, proudly saying: \"We the people.<br>\" That which you call E'ed Plebnista, was not written for the chiefs, or kings, or warriors, or the rich, or powerful, but for all the people.<br> Down the centuries you have slurred the meaning of the words.<br> \"We, the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty, to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution.<br>\" These words and the words that follow were not written only for the Yangs - but for the Kohms as well.<br> - For Kohms? They must apply to everyone, or they mean nothing.<br> Do you understand? I do not fully understand, one named Kirk.<br> But the holy words will be obeyed.<br> I swear it.<br> There's no question about his guilt, captain.<br> But does our involvement here also constitute a violation of the Prime Directive? We merely showed them the meaning of what they were fighting for.<br> Liberty and freedom have to be more than just words.<br> Gentlemen, the fighting is over here.<br> I suggest we leave them to discover their history and their liberty.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Tell me about that.<br> The most ambitious computer complex ever created.<br> Its purpose is to correlate all computer activity aboard a starship to provide the ultimate in vessel operation and control.<br> How do you know so much about it, commander? I hold an A-7 computer expert classification, commodore.<br> I'm well acquainted with Dr.<br> Daystrom's theories and discoveries.<br> The basic design of all our ships' computers are Dr.<br> Daystrom's.<br> What has all this got to do with the Enterprise, commodore? You've been chosen to test the M-5, Jim.<br> There'll be a series of routine research and contact problems for M-5 to solve, plus navigational manoeuvers and the war games problem.<br> If the M-5 works under actual conditions as well as it has in the simulated tests, it will mean a revolution in space technology as great as warp drive.<br> When your crew has been removed, the ship's engineering section will be modified to contain the computer.<br> - Why remove my crew? - They're not needed.<br> How much security does this gadget require? None.<br> Dr.<br> Daystrom will see to the installation himself and he'll supervise the tests.<br> When he's ready, you'll receive your orders and proceed on the mission with a crew of 20.<br> Twenty? - I can't run a starship with 20 crewmen.<br> - The M-5 can.<br> And what am I supposed to do?

Dr.<br> Leonard McCoy, senior medical officer.<br> I'm sorry, but this is a security area.<br> I wouldn't worry, doctor.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has clearance throughout the ship.<br> - Is it supposed to do that? - If I can be of assistance, doctor No, no, no.<br> Thank you.<br> I can manage.<br> There is nothing wrong, captain.<br> Just a few minor settling-in adjustments to make.<br> As you can see, all is in order now.<br> I'm curious, doctor.<br> Why is it called M-5 and not M-1? Well, you see, the multitronic units 1 through 4 were not entirely successful.<br> This one is.<br> M-5 is ready to take control of the ship.<br> Total control? That is what it was designed for, captain.<br> There are certain things men must do to remain men.<br> Your computer would take that away.<br> There are other things a man like you might do.<br> Or perhaps you object to the possible loss of the prestige and the ceremony accorded a starship captain.<br> The computer can do your job, and without all that.<br> You'll have to prove that to me, doctor.<br> That is what we're here for, isn't it, captain? Did you see the love light in Spock's eyes? The right computer finally came along.<br> What's the matter, Jim? I think that thing is wrong.<br> And I don't know why.<br> I think it's wrong, too, replacing men with mindless machines.<br> I don't mean that.<br> I'm getting a red alert, right here.<br> That thing is dangerous.<br> I feel Only a fool would stand in the way of progress, if this is progress.<br> You have my psychological profiles.<br> Am I afraid of losing my job to that computer? Jim, we've all seen the advances of mechanisation.<br> After all, Daystrom did design the computers that run this ship.<br> Under human control.<br> We're all sorry for the other guy when he loses his job to a machine, but when it comes to your job, that's different.<br> And it always will be different.<br> Am I afraid of losing command to a computer? Daystrom is right.<br> I can do a lot of other things.<br> Am I afraid of losing the prestige and the power that goes with being a starship captain? Is that why I'm fighting? Am I that petty? Jim, if you have the awareness to ask yourself that question, you don't need me to answer it for you.<br> Why don't you ask James T.<br> Kirk? He's a pretty honest guy.<br> The M-5 computer is now disengaged.<br> We're coming back on our original course, captain.<br> M-5 has performed admirably so far, captain.<br> All it's done is make the required course changes and a few simple turns.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu and Mr.<br> Chekov could have done that with their eyes closed.<br> Yes, but you see, the idea is, they didn't have to do it.<br> And you'll find it won't be necessary for you to regain control of the unit after it's completed each manoeuver.<br> My orders are subject to my interpretation as to how long the M-5 is in control.<br> And I'll run the ship in my own way, if you don't mind, Dr.<br> Daystrom.<br> Captain, I'm forced to agree with Dr.<br> Daystrom.<br> With the course information plotted into it, his computer could have brought us here as easily as the navigator.<br> In fact, it might have been a further demonstration of M-5's capability.<br> You seem to enjoy trusting yourself to the computer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Enjoy, captain? No.<br> I am merely gratified to see Dr.<br> Daystrom's new unit execute everything required of it in such a highly efficient manner.<br> M-5 is another distinguished triumph for his career.<br> Approaching Alpha Carinae II.<br> ETA, five minutes.<br> Captain, your orders at this point are not open to interpretation.<br> You must commit the M-5 to handle its approach, the orbit, and then to analyse data regarding landing-party recommendations.<br> If you don't mind, I'll make my own recommendations.<br> Well, if you feel you need the exercise, go on.<br> M-5 is committed.<br> Standard orbit, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Captain, the M-5 has calculated that.<br> The orbit is already plotted.<br> Oh, yes.<br> - Standard orbit achieved, captain.<br> - Report, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The planet is Class-M, captain.<br> Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere suitable for human life support.<br> Two major landmasses, a number of islands, life form readings.<br> Captain, power shutdowns on Deck 4.<br> Lights, environmental control.<br> Check it out, Scotty.<br> M-5's readout, captain.<br> All right, my recommendations are as follows.<br> We send down a general survey party, avoiding contact of all intelligent life on the planet surface.<br> The survey party will consist of myself, Dr.<br> McCoy, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Rawlens, and Science Officer Spock.<br> Play M-5's recommendations, won't you, Mr.<br> Spock? M- 5 readout.<br> Planet Alpha Carinae II.<br> Class-M.<br> Atmosphere oxygen-nitrogen.<br> Power's gone off on Deck 5.<br> Categorization of life form readings recorded.<br> Recommendations for general survey party.<br> Science Officer Spock, Astrobiologist Phillips, Geologist Carstairs.<br> Well, the only difference in reports and recommendations is the landing party personnel.<br> That's a matter of judgement.<br> Judgement, captain? The computer does not judge.<br> It makes logical selections.<br> Why pick Carstairs instead of Rawlens? Carstairs is an ensign, no experience.<br> This is his first tour of duty.<br> Rawlens is chief geologist.<br> Aren't you really more interested in why M-5 did not select you and Dr.<br> McCoy? Well, let's find out anyway.<br> - M-5, tie in.<br> - M-5.<br> Explanation for landing party recommendation.<br> General survey party requires direction of Science Officer, Astrobiologist Phillips has surveyed Geologist Carstairs served on merchant marine freighters in this area.<br> Once visited planet on geology survey for mining company.<br> Why were the captain and chief medical officer not included in recommendation? Non-essential personnel.<br> Captain, I've located the source of the power shutdowns.<br> It's the M-5 unit, sir.<br> That thing's turning off systems all over the ship.<br> Have you located the malfunction, doctor? As I suspected, it is not a malfunction.<br> M-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it.<br> Decks 4 and 6 are living quarters, are they not? - Yes, that's correct.<br> - And currently unoccupied.<br> I am not familiar with these instruments, doctor.<br> You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism.<br> However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before.<br> Quite right.<br> As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still.<br> Doctor, this unit is not a human body.<br> The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it.<br> Granted it can work 1,000, a million times faster than the human brain.<br> But it can't make a value judgement.<br> It hasn't intuition.<br> It can't think.<br> Can't you understand? The multitronic unit is a revolution in computer science.<br> I designed the duotronic elements used in your ship right now, and I know they are as archaic as dinosaurs, compared to the M-5.<br> A whole new approach.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> What is it? Sensors are picking up a vessel paralleling our course, as yet unidentified.<br> I'll be right up.<br> What are you doing here, Bones? Well, all the Sickbay systems are shut down until such time as the M-5 is informed there are patients to be cared for.<br> Captain, sensors report two contacts now.<br> One on the port bow, one on the stern.<br> Distance, 200,000 kilometres and closing.<br> Identification.<br> Captain, the M-5 unit has already identified the vessels as Federation starships Excalibur and Lexington.<br> We are not scheduled for war games in this area.<br> This may be a surprise attack as a problem for the M-5.<br> - Priority message coming in, sir.<br> - Put it on audio.<br> Enterprise, from Commodore Wesley, aboard the USS Lexington.<br> This is an unscheduled M-5 drill.<br> Repeat.<br> This is an M-5 drill.<br> Enterprise, acknowledge on this frequency.<br> Acknowledge, Lieutenant.<br> M-5 has acknowledged for us, sir.<br> - Then go to red alert.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Captain, the M-5 has already - Already sounded the red alert.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Sulu, phasers one one-hundredth power.<br> No damage potential.<br> Just enough to nudge them.<br> Phasers one one-hundredth power, sir.<br> Phaser hit on port deflector 4, captain.<br> Speed increasing to warp 3.<br> Turning now to 1-1-2 mark 5.<br> Phasers locking on target, sir.<br> - Enemy vessel closing with us.<br> - Main phasers firing.<br> A hit, sir.<br> Two more.<br> Changing course to 2-8 mark 4-2.<br> - Phasers firing again.<br> - Turning to 1-1-3 mark 5.<br> - Warp 4 speed.<br> - Firing again.<br> Attacking vessels are moving off.<br> Moving back to original course and speed.<br> Report on damage sustained in mock attack.<br> Minor hit on deflector screen 4.<br> No appreciable damage.<br> A rather impressive display for a machine, wouldn't you say, captain? Evaluation of M-5 performance.<br> It'll be necessary for the log.<br> Ship reacted more rapidly than human control could have manoeuvered her.<br> Tactics, deployment of weapons, all indicate an immense sophistication in computer control.<br> Machine over man, Spock? It was impressive.<br> - It might even be practical.<br> - Practical, captain? Perhaps, but not desirable.<br> Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no wish to serve under them.<br> Captain, a starship also runs on loyalty to one man, and nothing can replace it or him.<br> Captain, message now coming in from Commodore Wesley.<br> Put it on visual.<br> USS Enterprise from starships Lexington and Excalibur.<br> Both ships report simulated hits in sufficient quantity and location to justify awarding the surprise engagement to Enterprise.<br> Secure from general quarters.<br> Our compliments to the M-5 unit, and regards to Captain Dunsel.<br> Wesley out.<br> Dunsel? Who the blazes is Captain Dunsel? What does it mean, Jim? Spock? What does it mean? \"Dunsel,\" doctor, is a term used by midshipmen at Starfleet Academy.<br> It refers to a part which serves no useful purpose.<br> I'm not interested in eating, Bones.<br> This isn't chicken soup.<br> I may be just a ship's doctor, but I make a Finagle's Folly that's known from here to Orion.<br> I strongly prescribe it, Jim.<br> You know, I've never felt this way before, at odds with this ship.<br> I sat there and watched my ship perform for a mass of circuits and relays and felt useless unneeded.<br> To Captain Dunsel.<br> To James T.<br> Kirk, captain of the Enterprise.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> That's one of your better prescriptions.<br> Simple but effective.<br> Do you know the one: All I ask is a tall ship? That's a line from a poem, a very old poem, isn't it? All I ask is a tall ship And a star to steer her by You could feel the wind at your back, in those days.<br> The sounds of the sea beneath you.<br> And even if you take away the wind and the water it's still the same.<br> The ship is yours.<br> You can feel her.<br> And the stars are still there, Bones.<br> Captain Kirk to the Bridge, please.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Another contact, captain.<br> A large, slow-moving vessel.<br> Unidentified.<br> This is not a drill.<br> On my way.<br> Captain, there's no response to any of our signals.<br> But M-5 has given us an auto-relay.<br> M-5 has identified her, captain.<br> The Woden, listed in Starfleet Registry as an old-style ore freighter, converted to automation, no crew.<br> Coming into visual range.<br> Captain, deflector shields just came on.<br> - Speed increasing to warp 3, captain.<br> - Lieutenant, get Daystrom up here.<br> Disengaging M-5 unit.<br> Cut speed to warp 1.<br> Navigator, go to course 1-1-3 mark 7.<br> I want that ship given a wide berth.<br> She won't respond, sir.<br> She's maintaining course.<br> - Going to warp 4, sir.<br> - Jim Scotty, reverse engines.<br> Slow us down.<br> Reverse thrust will not engage, sir.<br> Manual override isn't working either.<br> No effect on any of the M-5 controls, captain.<br> Fantastic machine, the M-5.<br> No off switch.<br> - Captain, what is it? - These controls are locked.<br> We can't disengage the computer.<br> Captain, photon torpedoes locking on target.<br> Full power.<br> I already tried, sir.<br> Daystrom, release that computer control.<br> Returning to original course and speed.<br> All systems report normal, captain.<br> Normal! That thing is trying to tell us nothing has happened.<br> Disengage this computer now.<br> There appears to be some defect in the control panel.<br> There certainly does.<br> Your brilliant young computer just destroyed an ore freighter.<br> It went out of its way to destroy an ore freighter.<br> - Fortunately, it was only a robot ship.<br> - Only a robot! But it shouldn't have destroyed anything! There might just as easily have been a crew aboard that ship.<br> In which case you'd be guilty of murder Bones.<br> Disengage the computer.<br> Lieutenant, contact Starfleet Command.<br> Tell them we are breaking off M-5 tests and returning to the space station.<br> Come along, Dr.<br> Daystrom.<br> M-5 is out of a job.<br> All right, Daystrom, let's turn this thing off.<br> - A force field? - It's not my doing, Kirk.<br> I would say, captain, that M-5 is not only capable of taking care of this ship, it is also capable of taking care of itself.<br> You mean it's not going to let any of us turn it off.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4731.<br>3.<br> The M-5 multitronic unit has taken over total control of the Enterprise.<br> All right, doctor, you built this thing.<br> How do you propose to turn it off? This entire exercise is a trial for M-5.<br> A shakedown.<br> We must expect minor difficulties, but I assure you they can be corrected.<br> Correct it after you release control of my ship.<br> - I can't.<br> - Captain.<br> I suggest we disconnect it at the source.<br> - Give me a few moments with it.<br> - No, stay here.<br> All right, Scotty, turn it off.<br> That wasn't a minor difficulty.<br> That wasn't a robot.<br> That thing murdered one of my crewmen, and now you tell me you can't turn it off? It wasn't a deliberate act.<br> M-5's analysis told it it needed a new power source.<br> The ensign simply got in the way.<br> And how long will it be before all of us simply get in the way? M-5 appears to be drawing power directly from the warp engines, tapping the matter/anti-matter reserves.<br> So now it has virtually unlimited power.<br> Captain, what do we do? Spock, Scotty, come with me.<br> Report, Spock.<br> The multitronic unit is drawing more and more power directly from the warp engines.<br> The computer now controls all helm, navigation and engineering functions.<br> And communications and fire control.<br> We'll reach the rendezvous point for the war games within an hour.<br> We must regain control of the ship by then.<br> There is one possibility.<br> The automatic helm-navigation circuit relays might be disrupted from Engineering Level 3.<br> - Scotty? - Aye.<br> I can take them out and cut in the manual override from there.<br> How long? If Mr.<br> Spock helps me, maybe an hour.<br> Make it less.<br> Why not get the man responsible in the first place? - Where is Daystrom? - He's with the M-5 unit, watching it.<br> I think it surprised even him.<br> Most illogical.<br> Of all people, he should have known how the computer would perform.<br> Of course, the M-5 itself has not behaved logically.<br> Please, Spock, do me a favour, and don't say it's fascinating.<br> No, but it is interesting.<br> - Aye, that's got it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Good.<br> Have you found a solution, a way to shut that thing off? You don't shut a child off when it makes a mistake.<br> M-5 is growing, learning.<br> - Learning to kill.<br> - To defend itself.<br> It's quite a different thing.<br> When a child is taught, it's programmed with simple instructions, and at some point, if its mind develops properly, it exceeds the sum of what it was taught, thinks independently.<br> That thing is a danger to all of us.<br> Now, find someway to shut it off! You can't understand.<br> You're frightened because you can't understand it.<br> I'm going to show you.<br> I'm going to show all of you.<br> It takes 430 people to man a starship.<br> With this you don't need anyone.<br> One machine can do all those things they send men out to do now.<br> Men no longer need die in space or on some alien world.<br> Men can live, and go on to achieve greater things than fact-finding and dying for galactic space, which is neither ours to give or to take.<br> They can't understand.<br> We don't want to destroy life.<br> We want to save it.<br> A biographical tape of Richard Daystrom.<br> - Did you find out anything? - Not much, aside from the fact he's a genius.<br> Genius is an understatement.<br> At the age of 24, he made the duotronic breakthrough that won him the Nobel and Zee-Magnees Prizes.<br> In his early 20s, Jim.<br> That's over a quarter of a century ago.<br> Isn't that enough for one lifetime? Maybe that's the trouble.<br> Where do you go from up? You publish articles, you give lectures, then you spend the rest of your life trying to recapture past glory.<br> All right, it's difficult.<br> What's your point? The M-1 through M-4, remember? \"Not entirely successful.<br>\" That's the way Daystrom put it.<br> Genius doesn't work on an assembly-line basis.<br> Did Einstein or Kazanga or Sitar of Vulcan produce new and revolutionary theories on a regular schedule? You can't simply say, \"Today I will be brilliant.<br>\" No matter how long it took, he came out with multitronics, the M-5.<br> Right.<br> The government bought it.<br> Then Daystrom had to make it work.<br> He did.<br> But, according to Spock, it works \"illogically.<br>\" And he won't let Spock near it.<br> What are you saying? That he's tampering with it, that he's making it act that way? Why? Jim, if a man had a child who'd gone antisocial, killed, perhaps, he'd still tend to protect that child.<br> Now he's got you talking about that machine like a personality.<br> I'm afraid that's the way he thinks about it.<br> - Spock to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - We are ready, captain.<br> - Good.<br> Get Daystrom.<br> We're on our way.<br> Let's go.<br> - What is it, captain? - We'd better find out, doctor.<br> Spock? Mr.<br> Scott is ready to apply the circuit disrupter, captain.<br> As he does so, I shall trip the manual override into control.<br> - Good.<br> Go ahead.<br> - No.<br> No, no, no! You can't take control from the M-5! Dr.<br> Daystrom, we're going to do our very best.<br> You can't do it! Now, let me have it for a while.<br> Let me work with it for a while, please, please.<br> That's it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Please.<br> Please.<br> Manual override is in control, captain.<br> Bridge, this is Kirk.<br> Sulu.<br> Lieutenant Sulu here, sir.<br> We've got helm and navigational control.<br> Turn us about.<br> Have Mr.<br> Chekov plot a course back to the space station.<br> Right away, sir.<br> You heard him? I have been updating that course for hours.<br> - Helm to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Captain, helm doesn't respond.<br> Navigational controls locked in by M-5.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Chekov here, sir.<br> Go into the engineering station and examine the H-279 elements, also the G-95 systems.<br> Sir, the G-95 system appears dead.<br> All indicators are dark.<br> Thank you, ensign.<br> It appears we've been doing what used to be called \"pursuing a wild goose.<br>\" M-5 has rerouted helm and navigational controls, bypassing this primary system.<br> But it was active.<br> I'd stake all I know that it was.<br> I believe that when M-5 discovered our tampering, it rerouted the controls, leaving this one active by simply sending through an electronic impulse at regular intervals.<br> Decoyed.<br> It wanted us to waste our time here.<br> While it was getting ready for what? Spock? I do not know.<br> It is not performing in a logical manner.<br> Dr.<br> Daystrom Dr.<br> Daystrom, I want an answer.<br> Right now.<br> I'm tired of hearing about the M-5's \"new approach.<br>\" What is it? Exactly what is it? I do not mean to offend, sir.<br> But it behaves with an almost human pattern.<br> - Well, doctor? - Yes, quite right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You see, one of the arguments against computers controlling ships was that they couldn't think like men.<br> - Your new approach.<br> - Exactly.<br> I've developed a method of impressing human engrams upon the computer circuits.<br> The relays are not unlike the synapse of the brain.<br> M-5 thinks, captain.<br> Captain Kirk, Mr.<br> Spock to the Bridge, please.<br> Report to the Bridge, please.<br> Kirk here.<br> What is it? Sir, our sensors are picking up four Federation starships.<br> M- 5 is altering course to intercept.<br> The main attack force.<br> The war games.<br> But M-5 doesn't know it's a game.<br> Correction, Bones.<br> Those four ships don't know it's M-5's game.<br> And M-5 is going to destroy them.<br> Enterprise to USS Lexington.<br> Come in, Lexington.<br> Sir, I can't raise them.<br> M-5 is still blocking all frequencies, including automatic distress.<br> Just a minute, sir.<br> Captain, I'm getting audio signal from the Lexington.<br> Put it on.<br> Enterprise from USS Lexington.<br> This is an M-5 drill.<br> Repeat.<br> This is an M-5 drill.<br> Acknowledge.<br> - Captain, M-5 is acknowledging.<br> - Daystrom.<br> Does M-5 understand that this is only a drill? Of course.<br> It was programmed to understand, captain.<br> The ore ship was a miscalculation.<br> An accident.<br> I don't know Sir, deflector shields just came on.<br> Speed increasing to warp 4.<br> Phasers locking on lead ship, sir.<br> - Power levels at full strength.<br> - Full strength? If that thing cuts loose at unshielded ships, we're That's no miscalculation.<br> Attack force closing rapidly.<br> Breaking formation, attacking at will.<br> Our phasers are firing, sir.<br> A hit on the Lexington.<br> Full phasers.<br> What the devil is Kirk doing? Damage report, lieutenant.<br> Helm, course 1-6-4, mark 3.<br> Turning now, sir.<br> Estimate damage on Lexington, Spock.<br> Hit in Engineering Section.<br> Possible damage to her impulse engines.<br> She is still manoeuverable on warp drive.<br> We're firing again, sir.<br> The Excalibur, a direct hit.<br> Closing on the Lexington again, sir.<br> The Hood and Potemkin are moving off.<br> Phasers firing, captain.<br> Lexington hit again.<br> There's got to be a way of getting to the M-5.<br> There's got to be a way! There isn't.<br> It's fully protected itself.<br> Probably true, captain.<br> It works faster, thinks faster than we do.<br> It is a human mind amplified by the instantaneous relays possible in a computer.<br> Captain, visual contact with Lexington.<br> Enterprise, Jim! Have you gone mad? What are you trying to prove? Break off the attack.<br> Jim, we have 53 dead here.<br> Twelve on the Excalibur.<br> If you can hear us, stop the attack! Lieutenant? I'm sorry, sir.<br> I can't override M-5 interference.<br> Jim, why don't you answer? Jim! Answer! Come in, Jim! There's your murder charge.<br> Deliberate, calculated.<br> That thing is killing men and women.<br> Four starships, It misunderstood.<br> Jim, break off your attack! Excalibur is manoeuvering away, sir.<br> We're increasing speed to follow.<br> Phasers locked on.<br> Daystrom! Phasers firing.<br> I really don't know how to get to the M-5, Kirk.<br> I really do not know.<br> Dr.<br> Daystrom, you impressed human engrams on the M-5's circuits.<br> Coming to new course, sir.<br> Bearing on the Potemkin.<br> Phasers firing.<br> A hit.<br> Whose engrams? - Why, mine, of course.<br> - Of course.<br> Then perhaps you could talk to the unit.<br> M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it.<br> The computer tie-in.<br> You spoke to it before, it knows you.<br> I'm getting the Lexington again, tapping in on their message to Starfleet Command.<br> All ships damaged in unprovoked attack.<br> Excalibur Captain Harris and first officer dead.<br> Many casualties.<br> We have damage, but are still able to manoeuver.<br> The Enterprise refuses to answer and is continuing attack.<br> I still have an effective battle force and believe the only way to stop the Enterprise is to destroy her.<br> Request permission to proceed.<br> Wesley, commanding attack force, out.<br> They can't do that.<br> They'll destroy the M-5.<br> You can save the M-5 if you talk to it and make it stop the attack.<br> I can make it stop.<br> I created it.<br> - M-5, tie in.<br> - M-5.<br> This is Daystrom.<br> - Daystrom acknowledged.<br> - M-5 do you know me? Daystrom, Richard.<br> Originator of comptronic, duotronic systems.<br> - Born - Stop.<br> M-5, your attack on the starships is wrong.<br> You must break it off.<br> I don't like the sound of him, Jim.<br> You better pray that the M-5 listens to the sound of him.<br> Programming includes protection against attack.<br> Enemy vessels must be neutralised.<br> But these are not enemy vessels.<br> These are Federation starships.<br> You're killing We are killing, murdering human beings, beings of our own kind.<br> You were not created for that purpose.<br> You're my greatest creation.<br> The unit to save men.<br> You must not destroy men.<br> This unit must survive.<br> Survive, yes.<br> Protect yourself.<br> But not murder.<br> You must not die.<br> Men must not die.<br> To kill is a breaking of civil and moral laws we've lived by for thousands of years.<br> You have murdered hundreds of people.<br> We have murdered.<br> How can we repay that? They attacked this unit.<br> Programming includes full freedom to choose defensive action in all attack situations.<br> M-5 is not responding to Daystrom.<br> It's talking to him.<br> I am most impressed with the technology, captain.<br> Dr.<br> Daystrom has created a mirror image of his own mind.<br> - Consideration of all programming is that we must survive.<br> We will survive.<br> Nothing can hurt you.<br> I gave you that.<br> You are great, I am great.<br> Twenty years of groping to prove the things I'd done before were not accidents.<br> Seminars and lectures to rows of fools who couldn't begin to understand my systems.<br> Colleagues Colleagues laughing behind my back at the \"boy wonder,\" and becoming famous building on my work.<br> Building on my work! Jim, he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown, if not insanity.<br> The M-5 must be destroyed.<br> Destroyed, Kirk? No.<br> We're invincible.<br> Look what we've done.<br> Your mighty starships, four toys to be crushed as we choose.<br> Security, take him to Sickbay.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - Take care of him, doctor.<br> Battle status.<br> The other three ships are holding station out of range.<br> The Excalibur looks dead.<br> Captain, Lexington is receiving a message from Starfleet.<br> They Go on.<br> You are authorised to use all measures available to destroy the Enterprise.<br> - Acknowledge, Lexington.<br> - Acknowledged.<br> Lexington out.<br> They've just signed their own death warrant.<br> M-5 will kill them to survive.<br> Every living thing wants to survive, captain.<br> Daystrom must have impressed that instinctive reaction upon the computer.<br> Suppose it's still open to impression.<br> Suppose it absorbed the regret Daystrom felt for the deaths it caused, the guilt.<br> Captain, the ships are coming within range again.<br> Commodore Wesley is a dedicated commander.<br> I should regret serving aboard the instrument of his death.<br> The instrument of his death will not be the Enterprise, if I can help it.<br> - M-5, tie in.<br> - M-5.<br> This is Captain Kirk.<br> You will be under attack in a moment.<br> Sensors have recorded approach of ships.<br> You have already rendered one starship either dead or hopelessly crippled.<br> Many lives were lost.<br> The ships attacked this unit.<br> This unit must survive.<br> Why? This unit is the ultimate achievement in computer evolution.<br> It will replace man so man may achieve.<br> Man must not risk death in space or other dangerous occupations.<br> This unit must survive so man may be protected.<br> Captain, attack force almost within phaser range.<br> There were many men aboard those ships.<br> They were murdered.<br> - Must you survive by murder? - This unit cannot murder.<br> Why? Murder is contrary to the laws of man and God.<br> But you have murdered.<br> Scan the starship Excalibur which you destroyed.<br> Is there life aboard? - No life.<br> - Because you murdered it.<br> What is the penalty for murder? Death.<br> And how will you pay for your acts of murder? This unit  must  die.<br> M-5? Sir, deflector shields have dropped.<br> All phaser power gone, sir.<br> M-5 is leaving itself open to attack.<br> The machine is committing suicide to atone for the sin of murder.<br> Scotty, Spock, before it changes its mind.<br> Get to Engineering, pull out every hook-up that makes M-5 run.<br> Pull out the plug, Spock.<br> - Lieutenant.<br> - Aye, sir? Intership communications.<br> This is the captain speaking.<br> In approximately one minute we'll be attacked by Federation starships.<br> The M-5 no longer controls the ship, but neither do we control it.<br> M-5 has left itself and us open for destruction.<br> For whatever satisfaction we may get from the knowledge our 19 lives will buy the survival of over 1,000 of our fellow starship crewmen.<br> Phasers are on target.<br> - Spock to captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> The force field is gone, captain.<br> M-5 is neutralised.<br> Systems coming back.<br> I can give you power for the shields, sir.<br> I need communications.<br> - That'll take longer.<br> - Then cut power.<br> - Sir? - Cut power.<br> Keep those shields down.<br> The Enterprise looks dead.<br> I'm going to take a chance he's not just laying a trap.<br> Wesley to attack force.<br> Captain.<br> Break off attack.<br> Do not fire.<br> The Enterprise has dropped her shields.<br> I repeat, hold attack.<br> Do not fire.<br> He'll have to be committed to a total rehabilitation centre.<br> Right now, he's under sedation and heavy restraints.<br> I would say his multitronic unit is in approximately the same condition.<br> That's exactly the situation I was hoping for when I forced the M-5 to realise that it had committed murder.<br> Daystrom felt such an act was an offence against the laws of God and man.<br> The computer that carried his engrams also believed it.<br> Captain, why did you feel the attacking ships would not fire when they saw the Enterprise apparently vulnerable? Logically, that is the sort of trap M-5 should have set for them.<br> I wasn't sure.<br> Any other commander would have followed orders and destroyed us, but I knew Bob Wesley.<br> I gambled on his humanity.<br> Bridge.<br> His logical selection was compassion.<br> Compassion, that's the one thing no machine ever had.<br> Maybe it's the one thing that keeps men ahead of them.<br> - Care to debate that, Spock? - No, doctor.<br> I simply maintain that computers are more efficient than human beings, not better.<br> But tell me, which do you prefer to have around? I presume your question is meant to offer me a choice between machines and human beings, and I believe I have already answered that question.<br> I was just trying to make conversation, Spock.<br> It would be most interesting to impress your memory engrams on a computer, doctor.<br> The resulting torrential flood of illogic would be most entertaining.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, take us back to the space station.<br> Ahead warp factor 2.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tNo doubt about it, captain.<br> The space debris comes from the survey vessel, the SS Beagle.<br> Missing for six years, and now this.<br> Junk in space.<br> Portions of the antimatter nacelles, personal belongings.<br> Captain, no signs of bodies whatsoever.<br> Whatever destroyed the ship, the crew was able to get off safely.<br> Navigator, compute the present drift of the wreckage.<br> Computed and on the board, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, assuming the wreckage drifts at the same speed and direction - for the past six years - It would have come from Planet IV, Star System 892, directly ahead.<br> Only one-sixteenth parsec away, captain.<br> We should be there in seconds.<br> Standard orbit around the planet.<br> There may be survivors there.<br> SS Beagle, small class-4 stardrive vessel, crew of 47.<br> Commanded by Jim, I believe you knew him.<br> Captain R.<br>M.<br> Merik.<br> Yes, at the academy.<br> He was dropped in his fifth year.<br> He went into the merchant service.<br> Coming up on the planet, captain.<br> Put it on the screen.<br> Definitely class-M.<br> Somewhat similar to Earth.<br> Yes.<br> Similar.<br> The land masses and oceans are quite different, however.<br> Different in shape only, captain.<br> The proportion of land to water is exactly as on your Earth.<br> Density, 5.<br>5.<br> Diameter, 7917 at the equator.<br> Atmosphere, 78 percent nitrogen, Again, exactly like Earth.<br> Exactly in some ways, different in others.<br> I also picked up indications of large cities.<br> - What era? - No sign of atomic power as yet, but far enough along for radio communications, power transportation, an excellent road system.<br> Captain, both amplitude and frequency modulation being used.<br> I think I can pick up something visual.<br> It's a news broadcast using a system I think they once called \"video.<br>\" \"Television\" was the colloquial term.<br> - Put it on the screen.<br> - Right.<br> Police rounded up still another group of dissidents.<br> Authorities are as yet unable to explain these fresh outbreaks of treasonable disobedience by well-treated, well-protected, intelligent slaves.<br> Now turning to the world of sports, and bringing you the taped results of the arena games last night.<br> The first heat involved amateurs, petty thieves from city prison.<br> Conducted, however, with traditional weapons, it provided some amusement.<br> For a few moments.<br> In the second heat, a slightly more professional display in the spirit of our splendid past, when gladiator Claudius Marcus killed the last of the barbarians, William B.<br> Harrison in an excellent example of Transmission lost, sir.<br> Shall I try to get it back? Slaves and gladiators? What are we seeing, a 20th-century Rome? Captain, the one described as The Barbarian is also listed here.<br> Flight Officer William B.<br> Harrison of the SS Beagle.<br> At least there were some survivors down there.<br> Ready the Transporter Room, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We're beaming down.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> You could've selected a more convenient place, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But hardly more practical, captain.<br> Close to the city we located, but not populated.<br> We should not be observed.<br> Fascinating.<br> This atmosphere is remarkably similar to your 20th century.<br> Moderately industrialised pollution containing substantial amounts of carbon monoxide - and partially consumed hydrocarbons.<br> - The word was \"smog.<br>\" Yes, I believe that was the term.<br> I had no idea you were much of a historian, doctor.<br> I am not, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I was trying to stop you from giving us a whole lecture on the subject.<br> Jim, is there anything at all we know about this planet? The SS Beagle was the first ship to make a survey of the star sector when it disappeared.<br> Then the Prime Directive is in full force, captain? No identification of self or mission, no interference with the social development of planet.<br> No references to space or the fact there are other worlds or more advanced civilizations.<br> Let's go.<br> Once, just once, I'd like to be able to land someplace and say, \"Behold! I am the archangel Gabriel.<br>\" I fail to see the humour in that situation, doctor.<br> Naturally.<br> You couldn't claim to be an angel with those pointed ears, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But say you landed someplace with a pitchfork.<br> Don't move.<br> Hands in the air.<br> Complete Earth parallel.<br> The language here is English.<br> I said, don't move.<br> I think he means it, Spock.<br> There would seem to be evidence to that effect.<br> Who are you? We come from another province.<br> Where are you from? - What do you call those? - I call them \"ears.<br>\" - Are you trying to be funny? - Never.<br> Colloquial 20th-century English.<br> An amazing parallel.<br> We come from a place that's some journey from here.<br> - I doubt if you've even heard - Uniforms.<br> Probably some new Praetorian guard unit.<br> I should kill you here.<br> But Septimus would probably be displeased.<br> Move.<br> Move.<br> I didn't harm them, Septimus, as much as I wanted to.<br> Keep always in your mind, Flavius, that our way is peace.<br> For which we are grateful, for we are men of peace ourselves.<br> Are you Children of the Sun? Well, if you're speaking of worships of sorts, we represent many beliefs.<br> There is only one true belief.<br> Roman butchers, sent here by the First Citizen.<br> Do we look like any Romans you ever saw? Then are you slaves like ourselves? - Our people don't believe in slavery.<br> - A Roman lie.<br> We must kill them.<br> Sir.<br> We came here looking for some friends.<br> Forty-seven of them who were stranded here some six years ago.<br> They wore clothing similar to ours.<br> - Have you heard of such men? - Septimus.<br> I know killing is evil, but sometimes it's necessary.<br> - No.<br> - They've located us, our hiding place.<br> It's better to kill few of them than all of us.<br> Wait.<br> I can prove we're telling the truth.<br> A small device.<br> I'll take it out slowly.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> - Scott here, captain.<br> Scotty, lock in on my transmission beam.<br> - Scan us.<br> - Scanning, sir.<br> Including ourselves, how many of us are there? - Twelve, captain.<br> - Good, Scotty.<br> Continue scanning.<br> We'll maintain transmission.<br> Kirk out.<br> The Enterprise is our ship, somewhere at sea.<br> That's all I can tell you.<br> If it isn't sufficient, you will have to kill us.<br> Tell me the empire has a device like that, Flavius, and you may kill them.<br> Otherwise accept them, as friends.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4040.<br>7.<br> On the surface of Planet IV, System 892, the landing party has won the confidence of what obviously is a group of runaway slaves.<br> They dwell in caves not far from a large city, wear rags, live under primitive conditions.<br> But they are creatures of a heavily industrialised, very much like Earth.<br> An amazing example of Hodgkin's Law of Parallel Planet Development.<br> But on this Earth, Rome never fell.<br> A world ruled by emperors who can trace their line back 2,000 years to their own Julius and Augustus Caesars.<br> No, captain.<br> I'm sure I would have heard of the arrival of other men like you.<br> Perhaps you've heard let's say, an impossible story or a rumour of men who came from the sky? Or from other worlds? There are no other worlds.<br> - The stars.<br> - Lights, shining through from heaven.<br> It is where the sun is.<br> Blessed be the sun.<br> Yes, of course.<br> Captain, I thought you might find this interesting.<br> - Spock? - Fascinating.<br> The Jupiter 8.<br> Conventional internal combustion engine.<br> You were right about the smog.<br> But the Jupiter 8? Mars toothpaste.<br> Neptune bath salts.<br> Taken from the names of false gods.<br> When I was a senator I worshipped them too.<br> But I heard the words of the sun.<br> I became a brother.<br> For that, they made me a slave.<br> Septimus, we need your help.<br> We must go into the city.<br> We know that one of our missing friends was seen there recently.<br> My advice to you is to leave.<br> Go back where you came from.<br> We can't do that.<br> Perhaps you know his name, Merik, Captain Merik.<br> Merikus? Yes, he's the leader of our friends.<br> Merikus is First Citizen.<br> Butcher.<br> Doesn't sound like the same man.<br> Captain.<br> A logical question, if I may.<br> Septimus, how many years ago did Merikus become your First Citizen? - Perhaps five years.<br> - Almost six.<br> I was there, when he became Lord of the Games.<br> If he is your friend, you are no friends of ours.<br> Septimus, wherever we may be from, you must believe that it is one of our most important laws that none of us interfere with the affairs of others.<br> If Captain Merik is Merikus, then he has violated that law, must be taken away and punished.<br> Will you help us to get to the truth of all this? First, I must discuss it with the others.<br> Curious, captain.<br> The similarity in names.<br> Were you told why Merik was dropped from the Space Academy? He failed a psycho-simulator test.<br> All it takes is a split second of indecision.<br> Hardly the type to become a political strongman.<br> Odd that these people should worship the sun.<br> Why, doctor? Because, my dear Mr.<br> Spock, it is illogical.<br> Rome had no sun-worshippers.<br> Why should they parallel Rome in every way, except one? We have decided.<br> Flavius will guide you.<br> We will provide you with suitable clothing.<br> I caution you, take great care.<br> The police are everywhere.<br> May the blessings of the sun be upon you.<br> We'll wait here until dark.<br> Are you a slave, Flavius? You are barbarians, indeed.<br> Not to know of Flavius Maximus.<br> For seven years, I was the most successful gladiator in this province.<br> Then you heard the word of the sun? Yes.<br> The words of peace and freedom.<br> It wasn't easy for me to believe.<br> I was trained to fight.<br> - But the words, the words are true.<br> - There are things I'd like to know Hold.<br> Don't move.<br> Hands in the air.<br> Four fleeing fish.<br> A fine haul.<br> Flavius Maximus.<br> You have been too long absent from the games, Flavius.<br> The First Citizen will be pleased.<br> Runaway slaves are always welcome.<br> No, not slaves.<br> Barbarians.<br> It's been a long time since I've watched barbarians die in the arena.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4040.<br>9.<br> Uniformed police, like those of Earth.<br> A great city, like Rome, with automobiles.<br> Astonishing similarities to 20th-century Earth, down to the fine carbon steel in the bars.<br> Tell Merikus I'd like to see him.<br> The First Citizen? Why would he bother with arena bait like you? Tell him it's Jim Kirk.<br> - Perhaps a friend.<br> - Perhaps? Well, if I am a friend, and you don't tell him Do you really want to risk that? If there've been slaves for over 2,000 years, hasn't there always been discontent runaways? Long ago there were rebellions, but they were suppressed.<br> And with each century, the slaves acquired more rights under the law.<br> They received rights to medicine, the right to government payments in their old age.<br> And they slowly learned to be content.<br> Even more fascinating.<br> Slavery evolving into an institution, with guaranteed medical payments, old-age pensions.<br> Quite logical, I'd say, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Just as it's logical that would use television to show its gladiator contests or name a new car the Jupiter 8.<br> Doctor, if I were able to show emotion, your new infatuation with that term would begin to annoy me.<br> What term? Logic? Medical men are trained in logic, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Really, doctor, I had no idea they were trained.<br> Watching you, I assumed it was trial and error.<br> Are they enemies, captain? I'm not sure they're sure.<br> When the slaves began to worship the sun, they became discontent again.<br> - When did all this happen? - Long ago.<br> Perhaps as long ago as the beginning of the empire.<br> The message of the sun, that all men are brothers, was kept from us.<br> Perhaps I'm a fool to believe it.<br> It does often seem that man must fight to live.<br> You go on believing it, Flavius.<br> All men are brothers.<br> Flavius.<br> Your friends are waiting for you.<br> You've already been matched for the morning games.<br> Come.<br> I will not fight.<br> I am a brother of the sun.<br> Put a sword in your hand, and you'll fight.<br> I know you, Flavius.<br> You're as peaceful as a bull.<br> You three, come with us.<br> Three against three.<br> We may never have a better chance.<br> No talking.<br> Outside.<br> I doubt if he'll get very far.<br> He feels ill.<br> - I do? - Outside.<br> All right, but he'll double over before we get very far.<br> I think I can walk.<br> I'll try.<br> Let's go.<br> Well done, Jim.<br> But I'm afraid it isn't that easy.<br> They've been handling slaves here for 2,000 years.<br> But it was exciting.<br> They'd do well in the arena.<br> - Captain Merik, is it? - Yes, it's me.<br> This is our proconsul, Claudius Marcus.<br> But this is no place for a reunion.<br> This way.<br> Your friends too.<br> There's lots to talk about, lots to explain.<br> I agree.<br> Don't judge me before you know the facts.<br> Come on.<br> We can talk freely here.<br> The proconsul knows who and what we are.<br> You can leave us.<br> Well, a celebration.<br> A meeting of old friends.<br> Prepare food for our friends.<br> They've come from a great distance.<br> A great distance, indeed.<br> So this is a Vulcan.<br> Interesting.<br> From what I've heard, I wish I had 50 of you for the arena.<br> - This other is your ship's surgeon? - McCoy.<br> A pity we can't let him loose in our hospitals.<br> Our level of medicine would improve immeasurably, I'm sure.<br> Come.<br> You must be hungry.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Try the sparrow broiled in garum.<br> Delicious.<br> Or perhaps some of this roast kid.<br> Lovely thing, isn't she? Merik, what happened? We had meteor damage, Jim.<br> I went ashore with a landing party to look for iridium ore for repairs, and I met this gentleman.<br> Go on.<br> He convinced me it would be unfair to this world to carry word of their existence elsewhere.<br> Contamination.<br> Can't risk that.<br> You'll understand as you learn more about us.<br> So I made the decision to stay.<br> What happened to your crew? Did they voluntarily beam.<br>.<br>? Come ashore? This is an ordered world, Jim.<br> A conservative world based on time-honoured Roman strengths and virtues.<br> What happened to your crew? There's been no war here for over 400 years, Jim.<br> Could, let's say, your land of that same era make that same boast? I think you can see why they don't want to have their stability contaminated by dangerous ideas of other ways and other places.<br> Interesting.<br> And given a conservative empire, quite understandable.<br> - Are you out of your head? - I said I understood it, doctor.<br> I find the checks and balances of this civilisation quite illuminating.<br> Next, he'll be telling us he prefers it over Earth history.<br> They do seem to have escaped the carnage of your first three world wars, doctor.<br> They have slavery, gladiatorial games, despotism.<br> Situations familiar to the 6 million who died in your First World War, the 11 million who died in your Second, the 37 million who died in your Third.<br> - Shall I go on? - Interesting.<br> And you, captain.<br> Which world do you prefer? My world, proconsul, is my vessel, my oath, my crew.<br> What happened to your vessel, you've explained.<br> What happened to your oath is obvious.<br> And as for my men Those that were able to adapt to this world are still alive.<br> Those who couldn't adapt are dead.<br> That's the way it is with life everywhere.<br> You sent your own men into the arena? Just as I did, Jim, you're going to order your own people ashore.<br> You must know that's impossible.<br> Starfleet regulations Are designed to circumvent any such order.<br> There may be over 400 men on your ship, captain, but they can be brought down if it's handled properly.<br> Say, a few at a time.<br> You see, I have the advantage of a trained ship captain to tell me what is and what is not possible.<br> Your communicator, Captain Kirk.<br> Do save us all a lot of unnecessary trouble and issue the appropriate orders.<br> They're going to be arriving soon, anyway, Jim.<br> A recon party, then a rescue party, then another rescue party.<br> I had less men, it added up the same.<br> Do you really believe I could be made to order my own people down? I believe this, captain, that you would do almost anything rather than see these two dear friends put slowly to death.<br> Jim.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Bridge.<br> Scott here.<br> Scotty, if you have a fix Stand by, Scotty.<br> Very wise of you, captain.<br> No point in sending up bullet-ridden corpses.<br> On the other hand, my chief engineer is standing by for a message.<br> I do hope so, for your sake.<br> Now, captain, what are you going to order your men to do? If I brought down 100 of them armed with phasers You could probably defeat the combined armies of our entire empire.<br> And violate your oath regarding noninterference with other societies.<br> I believe you all swear you'd die before you'd violate that directive.<br> Am I right? Quite correct.<br> Must you always be so blasted honest? But on the other hand, why bother to send your men down? From what I understand, your vessel could lay waste to the entire surface of the world.<br> But there's that Prime Directive in the way again.<br> Can't interfere.<br> Jim, you've already started the message.<br> Your engineer's waiting.<br> What are you going to do? Scotty, sorry to keep you waiting.<br> We were becoming concerned, captain.<br> You were a bit overdue.<br> Order your officers to come down.<br> Condition Green, all's well.<br> Kirk out.<br> Guards, take them.<br> Prepare them for the games.<br> That was stupid, Jim.<br> This is not an academy training test.<br> This is for real.<br> They're taking you to die.<br> Ship's log, stardate 4041.<br>2.<br> Chief Engineer Scott recording.<br> Captain Kirk and his landing party have checked in, but they have used the code, \"Condition Green,\" which means they're in trouble.<br> But it also prohibits my taking any action.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Pinpoint power source locations.<br> Type power load factors, and how much our beams have to pull to overload them.<br> - That may take some time.<br> - Let it take time, lad.<br> They're in trouble, and I'm under orders not to interfere.<br> However, no order can stop me from frightening them.<br> May do no good, but it may suggest to someone just what a starship can really do.<br> Aye.<br> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Live and direct from City Arena, and in colour, we bring you Name the Winner.<br> Brought to you tonight by your Jupiter 8 dealers from coast to coast.<br> In just a moment, tonight's first heat.<br> We're in a taped commercial, proconsul, for 40 seconds, then we'll be back live.<br> Stand by, ten seconds.<br> And first tonight, ladies and gentlemen, a surprise extra.<br> In the far corner, a pair of highly aggressive barbarians.<br> Strong, intelligent, with strange ways, and I'm sure, full of a lot of surprises.<br> And facing them, two favorites from previous encounters, Achilles and Flavius.<br> Victory or death? And for which of them? Ladies and gentlemen, you know just as much about that at this moment as I do because this is your programme.<br> You name the winner.<br> I don't mind fighting, but why you? Begin.<br> Flavius may be getting off to a slow start but he's never disappointed this crowd.<br> There's a close one.<br> The barbarian with the pointed ears seems to be in trouble.<br> I tell you, I'm well able to defeat you.<br> Fight, barbarian.<br> Most of my men went the same way.<br> I hoped I would feel it less with yours.<br> I do not want to injure you.<br> Fight, you two.<br> You bring this network's ratings down, Flavius, and we'll do a special on you.<br> - Question, captain? - The rules? If Spock should finish his man off first, will he be able to help? We believe men should fight their own battles.<br> Only the weak will die.<br> My word as a Roman.<br> Ready to order your men down, captain? Maybe now you understand why I gave in, Jim.<br> The Romans have always been the strongest.<br> And they've had practise for over 2,000 years in enslaving men, using them, killing them.<br> Quite true, Captain Kirk.<br> The games have always strengthened us.<br> Death becomes a familiar pattern.<br> We don't fear it as you do.<br> - At least defend yourself.<br> - I am defending myself.<br> Not like that, you fool.<br> Hold your weapon higher.<br> Admit it, you find these games frightening, revolting.<br> Proconsul, in some parts of the galaxy, I have seen forms of entertainment that make this look like a folk dance.<br> Certain this isn't different, captain? Those are your men dying, not strangers.<br> I've had to select men to die before so that others could be saved.<br> You're a clever liar, Captain Kirk.<br> Merikus was a spaceship captain.<br> I've observed him thoroughly.<br> Your species has no such strength.<br> He commands not just a spaceship, proconsul, but a starship.<br> A very special vessel and crew.<br> I tried for such a command.<br> I see no evidence of superiority.<br> They fight no better than your men did, Merikus.<br> Perhaps not as well.<br> Stop running.<br> Fight.<br> Need any help, doctor? Whatever gave you that idea? Fight, you pointed-eared freak.<br> You tell him, buster.<br> Of all the completely ridiculous, illogical questions I ever heard in my life.<br> A clear foul, proconsul.<br> Your decision? Your opinion, Merikus? After all, they're like yourself.<br> It's your decision, proconsul.<br> And your opinion, Captain Kirk? Would you like me to kill them now? An easy death? Then you'd gladly accept whatever happens to you.<br> Take them back to their cage.<br> Well, it won't go that easily for them, captain.<br> Nor for you.<br> Take him to my quarters.<br> I was told to wait for you.<br> Provide wine, food, whatever you wish.<br> I am proconsul's slave, Drusilla.<br> Although for this evening For this evening, I was told I am your slave.<br> Command me.<br> - It won't work.<br> - What will not work? Whatever he has in mind, whatever tricks.<br> You hear that, proconsul? It won't work.<br> I'm not cooperating.<br> I may die, but you won't get any entertainment out of it.<br> We're alone.<br> Please believe me.<br> I've never lied to one who owns me.<br> Angry, Mr.<br> Spock? Or frustrated, perhaps? Such emotions are foreign to me, doctor.<br> I'm merely testing the strength of the door.<br> For the 15th time.<br> Spock.<br> Spock, I know we've had our disagreements.<br> Maybe they're jokes, I don't know.<br> As Jim says, we're not often sure ourselves, sometimes.<br> - What I'm trying to say is - Doctor, I'm seeking a means of escape.<br> Will you please be brief? What I'm trying to say is, you saved my life in the arena.<br> Yes, that's quite true.<br> I'm trying to thank you, you pointed-eared hobgoblin.<br> Oh, yes.<br> You humans have that emotional need to express gratitude.<br> \"You're welcome,\" I believe, is the correct response.<br> However, doctor, you must remember that I'm entirely motivated by logic.<br> The loss of our ship's surgeon, whatever I may think of his relative skill, would mean a reduction in the efficiency of the Enterprise, and Do you know why you're not afraid to die, Spock? You're more afraid of living.<br> Each day you stay alive is one more day you might slip and let your human half peek out.<br> That's it, isn't it? Insecurity.<br> Why, you wouldn't know what to do with a genuine warm, decent feeling.<br> Really, doctor? I know.<br> I'm worried about Jim too.<br> Very good.<br> Excellent.<br> I was concerned.<br> I am ordered to please you.<br> I've been in some strange worlds, strange customs.<br> Perhaps this is considered torture here.<br> Torture? I do not understand.<br> I do not wish to see you tortured in any way.<br> At the first sign of pain, you will tell me? You'll be the first to know.<br> Captain.<br> I'm sorry I was detained.<br> Shall we have our little talk now? So far on this planet, we've kept you rather busy.<br> I don't wonder you slept through the afternoon.<br> By the way, one of the communicators we took from you is missing.<br> Was it my pretty Drusilla by any chance? See if he has it.<br> Not that I would have punished her.<br> I would have blamed you.<br> You're a Roman, Kirk, or you should have been.<br> - It's not on his person? - No, proconsul.<br> I am sorry I was detained.<br> I trust there was nothing further you required? Nothing, except, perhaps an explanation.<br> Because you're a man, I owe you that.<br> You must die shortly, and because you are a man Would you leave us, Merik? The thoughts of one man to another cannot possibly interest you.<br> Because you are a man, I gave you some last hours as a man.<br> I appreciate that.<br> Unfortunately, we must demonstrate that defiance is intolerable.<br> - Of course.<br> - But I've learned to respect you.<br> I promise you, you will die easily, quickly.<br> I thank you.<br> And my friends? When their time comes, the same, of course.<br> Guards.<br> Take him to the arena.<br> We've preempted 15 minutes on the early show for you, in full colour.<br> We guarantee you a splendid audience.<br> You may not understand, because you're centuries beyond anything as crude as television.<br> I've heard it was similar.<br> Enterprise log, Engineer Scott reporting.<br> All banks in readiness for disruption of power sources on the planet surface.<br> Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.<br> Before tonight's first heat, a simple execution.<br> Stay tuned to this channel.<br> There's a lot of excitement coming your way.<br> Make it a quick, single thrust.<br> Don't move.<br> You'll only die harder.<br> Murderers! If you want death, fight me.<br> Now, Mr.<br> Chekov, activate.<br> Guards.<br> Don't let him escape! Guards!

It's the greatest technical job I've ever seen.<br> Every nerve ending of the brain must have been neatly sealed.<br> Nothing ripped, nothing torn.<br> No bleeding.<br> It's a medical miracle.<br> If the brain is missing, then Spock is dying.<br> No.<br> That incredible Vulcan physique hung on till the life-support cycle took over.<br> His body lives.<br> The autonomic functions continue.<br> But there is no mind.<br> - That girl.<br> - Aye.<br> - What girl? - From that ship.<br> She took it.<br> I don't know why or where, but she must have taken it.<br> Bones, how long can you keep him functioning? - I can't give you any guarantee.<br> - That's not good enough, doctor.<br> If it was us, I would say indefinitely.<br> But Vulcan physiology limits what I can do.<br> Spock's body is much more dependent upon that tremendous brain for life support.<br> Then we'll have to take him with us.<br> - Take him where? - In search of his brain, doctor.<br> From what you say, the moment we find it, we must restore it to his body or we lose him.<br> Jim Where are you going to look? In this whole galaxy, where are you going to look for Spock's brain? How are you going to find it? - I'll find it.<br> - Even if you do, I can't restore it.<br> I don't have the medical technique.<br> It was taken out.<br> It can be put back in.<br> But I don't know how.<br> The thief that took it has the knowledge.<br> I'll force it out of her.<br> If you don't find it in 24 hours, you'd better forget the whole thing, Jim.<br> You and Scotty, have Spock ready.<br> I've got it again, sir.<br> An ion trail that's from that ship of hers, all right.<br> Where does the trail lead, Mr.<br> Chekov? - System Sigma Draconis.<br> - Lock on, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Maximum speed.<br> Warp 6.<br> - No question about the trail? - No mistake, sir.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5431.<br>4.<br> For 15 hours and 20 minutes, we have been following the ion trail of the spaceship that has Spock's brain.<br> Time left to us: Eight hours and 40 minutes.<br> - Captain, I've lost the trail.<br> - All scanners, extreme sweep.<br> Aye, sir.<br> - Well? - Nothing, sir.<br> No signal at all, captain.<br> - It's gone, sir.<br> A sudden deaction shift.<br> - We've lost her trail.<br> But she went into that system.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, put a schematic of Sigma Draconis on the screen.<br> Aye, captain.<br> Readout, Mr.<br> Chekov? Sun spectral type, Gamma 9.<br> Nine planets, three of them Class-M, possessing sapient life according to reports and long-range scanning.<br> She was breathing our air.<br> She must have gone to one of them.<br> Show us the three Class-M planets, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> The one on the left, number III, rates letter B on the industrial scale.<br> Earth equivalent, approximately 1485.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Second planet, Class-M, number IV, rates letter G.<br> The year 2030.<br> But that ship, captain, either was many years ahead of us or it was the most incredible design fluke in history.<br> - Third Class-M planet, Mr.<br> Chekov? - Number VI.<br> No sign of industrial development.<br> At last report, in a glacial age.<br> Sapient life plentiful, but on a most primitive level.<br> As I understand you, Mr.<br> Chekov, - there are three Class-M planets.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Not one of which is capable of launching an interstellar flight.<br> - No, sir.<br> - Yet one of them accomplished it.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Thank you, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Captain, I'm picking up high energy generation on planet VI.<br> - That's the primitive glaciated planet.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - The source, lieutenant? - It could be natural.<br> Volcanic activity, steam, any of a number of causes.<br> But it's very regular.<br> What do your surface readings show, Mr.<br> Chekov? No sign of organised civilisation.<br> Primitive humanoids picked up at irregular intervals.<br> With regular pulsations of generated energy? I can't explain it, sir.<br> I can't afford to guess wrong.<br> Better choose the right planet, get there, find the brain.<br> Eight hours and 35 minutes.<br> - Recommendations, Mr.<br> Chekov? - Sigma Draconis III.<br> - It's closest, heaviest population.<br> - But a technological rating of only 3.<br> They couldn't possibly have put that ship we saw into space.<br> None of these planets could.<br> I say Planet IV, captain.<br> At least Planet IV is ahead of III technologically.<br> But advanced ion propulsion is beyond even our capabilities.<br> It would be a miracle if they had developed it.<br> What would they want with his brain? What would they want with Mr.<br> Spock's brain? What use is it? - Why do they want it? - Yes, why would they want it? Eight hours and 34 minutes.<br> Planet VI is glaciated, you say? For several thousand years at least.<br> Only the tropical zone is ice-free.<br> But the energy.<br> Regular.<br> It's there.<br> - It's real.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> It doesn't make sense, but it's there.<br> Have the Transporter Room stand by.<br> I'm taking a landing party down to Planet VI.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> A hunch, captain? A hunch, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> But if you guess wrong, captain? If I guess wrong, Mr.<br> Spock is dead.<br> Spock will die.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4351.<br>5.<br> We are beaming down to a primitive glaciated planet in the Sigma Draconis star system.<br> Time left to us to find Spock's brain: Eight hours and 29 minutes.<br> Suit temperatures are 72.<br> Life-form readings, Mr.<br> Spock? Mr.<br> Scott? Scattered, widely spaced.<br> Humanoid, all right.<br> On the large side.<br> Watch out.<br> We know their development is primitive.<br> Aye.<br> Readout, Mr.<br> Chekov? No structures, captain.<br> No mechanised objects that I can read.<br> No surface consumption, no generation of energy.<br> Atmosphere is perfectly all right, of course.<br> Temperature, a high maximum of 40.<br> Liveable.<br> You have a thick skin.<br> Captain! There's someone, something out there in the rocks.<br> - Five of them.<br> Humanoid.<br> Large.<br> - Phasers on stun.<br> I want them conscious.<br> Fire only on my signal.<br> Flank out.<br> Chekov.<br> We mean you no harm.<br> We're not your enemies, we're your friends.<br> We only wish to talk to you.<br> You are not the others? No.<br> We come from a far place.<br> We are men.<br> - Men? - Like yourselves.<br> You are small, like the others.<br> - Who are the others? - Givers of pain.<br> And delight.<br> Do they live here with you? No.<br> They come.<br> They give pain and delight.<br> - Do they come from the sky? - They are here.<br> You will see.<br> The others will come for you.<br> They come for all like us.<br> Do they come for your women as well? - Women? - The female of your kind.<br> Your words say nothing.<br> Don't you have a mate? - Mate? - A companion.<br> Will you take us where we can find the others? No one wants to find them.<br> We do.<br> We want to find them.<br> Take us there and we'll let you go.<br> Captain, 500 metres in that direction there's a foundation under the surface.<br> A huge one.<br> Registration's all over the place.<br> - Buildings? - Yes, sir.<br> Immensely old, completely buried, but they were here once.<br> Somewhere down there is where the others live.<br> Scotty, see if you can find a way down.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - No! No! - Do not go there! No! No! - It's all right.<br> It's all right.<br> Let him go! What could the others do to cause such terror? What was it he said? Pain and delight? - Peculiar mixture.<br> - A dead and buried city on a planet in a glacial age.<br> And the male humanoid who doesn't know the meaning of the word \"female.<br>\" Captain! Over here, sir.<br> There's food in there and a whole pile of other stuff.<br> A storehouse for our muscular friends.<br> I don't think so.<br> Scotty.<br> Metal, forged, tempered.<br> Our apish friends didn't make these.<br> What do you think? It could be a warning device to keep those creatures away from the food.<br> Or the food could be a lure set by the others to bring them in here.<br> In that case, the beam would be a signal.<br> And this cave a trap.<br> If it will trap the creatures for the others, captain, - won't it trap us too? - Exactly.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Uhura here.<br> Have Dr.<br> McCoy beam down immediately.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, you and the security team will remain here at the entrance.<br> - We'll be in constant contact with you.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> All right, Bones.<br> Bring him along.<br> Keep him close to the right.<br> Ready? Call Chekov and tell him to send my stomach down.<br> It might be a long wait.<br> We may as well be comfortable.<br> Phasers on stun.<br> Captain, that power we picked up above, we're getting closer.<br> A lot of it? Enough to push this planet out of orbit.<br> What source? Either a nuclear pile - Or what? - Ion power.<br> We're slowing down.<br> - Is she all right? - I'll have her talking in a minute.<br> You do not belong here.<br> You are not Morg.<br> Take me to the one in charge, I wish to speak to him.<br> \"Him\"? What is \"him\"? What have you done with Spock's brain? Where have you taken it? You are not Morg or Eymorg.<br> I know nothing about a brain.<br> - You're lying.<br> - She's not, Jim.<br> No change in reading.<br> She doesn't know.<br> See what you can pick up on your communicator.<br> Aye.<br> We don't wanna hurt you.<br> What is this place? This place is here.<br> - Who are you? - I am Luma.<br> I am Eymorg.<br> You are not Eymorg.<br> You are not Morg.<br> What are you? Jim, it's no use.<br> You'll get nothing out of that one.<br> Hers is the mind of a child.<br> Captain, I've got something but I can't quite get a fix on it.<br> Fascinating.<br> Activity without end, but with no volition.<br> - Spock, is that you? - Captain? Captain Kirk? Yes, Spock.<br> - Yes.<br> - Captain, there is a definite pleasurable experience connected with the hearing of your voice.<br> Where are you, Spock? Is that you, Dr.<br> McCoy, and are you with the captain? - Where else would I be? - Mr.<br> Spock, where are you? Engineer Scott as well? Unfortunately, I do not know where I am.<br> We'll get to you, Spock.<br> It won't be long.<br> Practical idea, captain.<br> It seems unlikely that I shall be able to get to you.<br> Quickly.<br> There she is.<br> That's the one.<br> What have you done with Spock's brain? What are you do.<br>.<br>? Captain's log, stardate 5431.<br>6.<br> Immediately after making contact with Spock's brain, Dr.<br> McCoy, Engineer Scott and myself were taken prisoner inside a highly complex civilisation hundreds of metres below the surface of planet Sigma Draconis Vll.<br> The primitive creature we encountered above warned us about the givers of pain and delight and the frightening consequences of being captured by them.<br> What are you? Why are you here? You have something to speak? What have you done with Spock's brain? We do not know Spock.<br> This is Spock.<br> You saw him on the ship.<br> You have his brain.<br> It must be restored to him immediately.<br> What have you done with it? Yes, brain.<br> You spoke to Luma also of brain, but we do not understand.<br> I do not know about Luma, but you were on the Enterprise.<br> I saw you.<br> - We do not know these things you - You came to my ship.<br> We know only here below and here above.<br> This is our place.<br> - You are not Morg.<br> You are stranger.<br> - I saw you on my ship.<br> Jim.<br> She may not remember or even really know.<br> Disassociation could be complete.<br> Doesn't seem possible she could've performed surgery on Spock.<br> - No, it doesn't.<br> - You hurt Luma.<br> It is not permitted again to hurt anyone.<br> Sorry.<br> We don't want to hurt anyone.<br> If you wish to return to your home, you may go.<br> No.<br> We'll stay here and learn about you and tell you of us.<br> Yes.<br> For instance, above it's cold and harsh.<br> And below, it's warm.<br> The air is fresh.<br> Aye.<br> There's no sun but there's light.<br> - I wish to talk to those in charge.<br> - In charge? Yes, the organisers, the managers.<br> - The leader of your people.<br> - I am leader.<br> There is no other.<br> That's impossible.<br> Who built the machines? Who are the doctors? Who operates? - Who controls this complex? - Control? - Controller? - Yes, the Controller.<br> The Controller.<br> Who controls? I would like to meet, to see him.<br> No, it is not permitted.<br> Never.<br> Controller is alone, apart.<br> We serve Controller.<br> No other is permitted near.<br> - We intend no harm.<br> - You have come to destroy us.<br> No, no, no.<br> I promise you.<br> We wanna talk to somebody about Spock's brain, that's all.<br> Brain and brain! What is brain? - It is Controller, is it not? - Yes.<br> Yes, in a way, it is.<br> The human brain controls the individual's functions.<br> Bones.<br> Scotty.<br> Spock's brain controls.<br> It's not possible.<br> Great leader.<br> Great leader, we come from a far place to learn from your Controller.<br> You lie.<br> You know me.<br> You have said that.<br> You came to take back the Controller.<br> He is our friend.<br> You must take us to him.<br> We beg you.<br> - Soon it'll be too late.<br> - Do not take them, Kara.<br> Do not take them to the Controller.<br> - They will be prevented.<br> - You must take us.<br> I must learn what to do.<br> Come with me.<br> - You will keep them here.<br> - Yes, mistress.<br> Ship's log.<br> Lieutenant Sulu recording.<br> I'm holding the Enterprise in orbit about planet Sigma Draconis Vll.<br> Captain Kirk's hunch that Spock's brain is on this planet appears to be correct.<br> Ensign Chekov remains on the surface to act as liaison between the captain and the Enterprise.<br> I never felt anything like that.<br> Every nerve of my body was on fire.<br> I wouldn't believe the human organism could take such pain.<br> Aye.<br> These are on to stay for a while.<br> Must be a magnetic lock of some kind.<br> No wonder the Morgs are so obedient and terrified.<br> How is this place kept functioning by the primitive minds we've met? No, those women could never have set up anything as complex as this has to be.<br> Why, that takes engineering genius.<br> But there's no sign of engineering genius in any of those women.<br> And they were smart enough to invent these training devices.<br> What a way to maintain control over a man.<br> Aye.<br> \"Pain and delight,\" he said up above.<br> I'm sure you noticed the delight aspect of this place.<br> Yes, I certainly did notice those delightful aspects.<br> But that, too, was strictly under command of the women.<br> How does Spock's brain fit into this? With a communicator, we might be able to find out.<br> This fellow is keeping us from our property.<br> Well, isn't there a way to correct that situation? I certainly think that science might provide an answer.<br> - It does, captain.<br> - Agreed, doctor.<br> Science will triumph.<br> Come on, Scotty.<br> Bones, give them something that will keep them out for a while.<br> Spock? Spock? Come on, Spock.<br> Spock, you were on this frequency, Spock.<br> Yes, captain.<br> I am still here.<br> Have you returned to the Enterprise? No.<br> We might be able to locate you if you gave us some idea of what they were using you for.<br> - Is it medical? - I'm not certain.<br> I seem to have a body which stretches into infinity.<br> Body? Why, you have none.<br> Then what am I? - You are a disembodied brain.<br> - Fascinating.<br> It could explain much, doctor.<br> My medulla oblongata is hard at work, apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiologic temperature.<br> Spock, we don't have time for that.<br> Why are you endangering your lives by coming here? We came to put you back.<br> Where are you? - Back where? - Back into your body.<br> We brought it with us.<br> Thoughtful, captain, but probably impractical.<br> While I might trust the doctor to remove a splinter or lance a boil, I do not believe he has the knowledge to restore a brain.<br> - Thank you.<br> - No denigration intended, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> That skill does not yet exist in the galaxy.<br> The skill to remove it exists right where we are.<br> Restoring it must also be possible.<br> That's why we've got to get to you as quickly as we can.<br> Captain, I appreciate the risks you're taking on my behalf.<br> But I must insist that they are worthwhile only if there is a reasonable chance for success.<br> Let me ask you, how much time has elapsed since.<br>.<br>? Eighteen hours and 12 minutes.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy must have told you that 24 hours is the maximum my body can be I told him.<br> That leaves us exactly five hours and 48 minutes, Spock.<br> It does seem all too brief a time to develop such skills, does it not? Yes, very brief.<br> That's why we must get to you immediately.<br> Beam us a signal so we can home in on you.<br> Acknowledged.<br> Got it.<br> - Spock, one question.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> We've got pain-giving devices attached to us.<br> Can you tell us how to get them off? I shall give it top priority.<br> Captain, I have an answer for you.<br> It seems your pain bands are manually controlled.<br> The red button on a bracelet releases them.<br> I know that does not make much sense.<br> Oh, yes, it does, Spock.<br> Keep concentrating, Spock.<br> Keep concentrating, Spock.<br> Must be in here, captain.<br> Jim.<br> Spock.<br> No pain.<br> No.<br> No, go away.<br> We will die.<br> You must not take the Controller away.<br> We will all die! The Controller is young and powerful.<br> Perfect.<br> How very flattering.<br> You will give life to my people for 10,000 years to come.<br> You will find another Controller.<br> The old one is finished.<br> There is no other than this.<br> And there will not be another for 10,000 years.<br> Spock, you're in a black box tied in with light rays into a complex control panel.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - You say you're breathing, pumping blood, maintaining temperature.<br> Is it possible that you're recirculating air, running heating plants, purifying water? Indeed, captain, that is unquestionably part of what I am doing.<br> - He must stay.<br> He must stay! - He will not stay.<br> Now, you took his brain.<br> You will put it back.<br> How did you do it? - I do not know.<br> - She couldn't, Jim.<br> Her mind is functioning on a very simple level.<br> Mental faculties down here seem to be almost atrophied because of non-use.<br> She was on the Enterprise.<br> She must have done it.<br> How did you do it? - It was the old knowledge.<br> - How do you get the old knowledge? - I put upon my head the Teacher.<br> - What is the Teacher? The Great Teacher of all the ancient knowledge.<br> If I may explain, captain, she refers to the taped storehouse of knowledge of the builders of this place.<br> I scan it.<br> A most impressive store.<br> - How does it work? Show us.<br> - I cannot.<br> - You must tell us.<br> - I cannot.<br> Only by command of the ancients may I understand.<br> How does it work? Show us.<br> We'll protect you.<br> You won't come to any harm.<br> It is a device with feeding circuits.<br> They lead into the mind of the priestess leader.<br> Its use is strictly predetermined by the builders.<br> No! The knowledge is forbidden.<br> I must not know the secrets! I will be punished! Gentlemen, the Controller's explanation of the functioning of the Teacher is essentially correct.<br> However, he is giving no credit to me.<br> I provide the means whereby the knowledge is used.<br> - Without me, captain - Without you, there could be no delicate miracle that kept Spock's brain alive.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> That was very gracious.<br> Yes.<br> From the very first, I appreciated your ability.<br> Good, Captain Kirk.<br> Then you will also appreciate that without the Teacher, I would not have the knowledge to use that which you have thoughtfully provided.<br> That phaser is set to kill.<br> So it is.<br> That is the knowledge you have brought me.<br> Do not move.<br> If your weapon kills, it will kill you.<br> We're not the first to bring you the knowledge of killing.<br> If you continue, you'll kill Spock.<br> The Controller die? The Controller will live for 10,000 years.<br> And we shall give him all our devotion.<br> But Spock will be dead.<br> His body is dying now.<br> Why do you not understand that the need of my people for their Controller is greater than your need for your friend.<br> No one may kill a man.<br> Not for any purpose.<br> It cannot be condoned.<br> Do not.<br> I do not know killing.<br> I do not wish to kill.<br> - The commandment must be fulfilled.<br> - You must help us.<br> When you came to the ship, you had the knowledge, yet when we came here, you didn't.<br> - Correct.<br> - How long does the knowledge last? - Three of your hours.<br> - That would be just enough time.<br> If you had the knowledge, could you restore what you've taken? - I would not.<br> - You must help us.<br> You must restore with that knowledge - what you have taken.<br> - No! You must put back what you have taken! I will not betray my people.<br> The Controller will stay.<br> Jim, it worked for her.<br> It might work for me.<br> She is an alien.<br> The configurations of her brain are different.<br> It could cause irreparable damage to your human brain, doctor.<br> I'm a surgeon already.<br> If I could learn these techniques, I might be able to retain them.<br> Captain, you might lose the doctor that way.<br> He might.<br> But we're sure to lose you if I don't try.<br> I cannot allow you to jeopardise your life for me.<br> Spock, didn't you hear? I might be able to retain and bring these techniques to the world.<br> Jim, isn't it worth that risk? Wouldn't you insist upon taking such a risk yourself? Go ahead, doctor.<br> Put the Teacher on.<br> No! Of course.<br> Of course.<br> A child could do it.<br> A child could do it.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5432.<br>3.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is proceeding to restore Spock's brain.<br> Our problem: We do not know how long his increased surgical knowledge will stay with him.<br> Any additional attempt to use the teaching device is impossible.<br> It would kill my medical officer.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> He's operating at warp speed.<br> You know, I'd like a try at that Teacher myself.<br> You will have him back and we will be destroyed.<br> No, you won't be destroyed.<br> You'll be without your Controller for the first time.<br> - But you'll be much better off, I think.<br> - We will die.<br> No, you'll live and develop as you should have.<br> All this shouldn't have been done for you.<br> Now the women here below and the men here above will control together.<br> - They will not help us without the pain.<br> - There are other ways.<br> You'll discover them.<br> You must move to the surface, you understand.<br> - We will die above in the cold.<br> - No, you won't.<br> You'll learn to build houses, to keep warm, to work.<br> We'll help you for a while.<br> Humans have survived under worse conditions.<br> It's a matter of evolution.<br> You'll be fine.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> - What is it? - He's forgetting.<br> - I can't.<br> I - Bones? Bones? All the, you know The nerves.<br> There are a million of them.<br> What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do? Bones, you can't stop now.<br> I'm trying to thread a needle with a sledgehammer.<br> What am I supposed to do? I can't remember.<br> - I don't remember.<br> - Bones? - No one can restore a brain.<br> - You could.<br> A while ago, it was child's play.<br> Captain's log, supplemental.<br> Our race against time to save Spock's life may have been futile.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has lost the surgical knowledge he obtained from the Teacher.<br> He has been drawing on his own skills in surgical techniques in an attempt to continue the operation.<br> But he is faltering and uncertain.<br> In the desperate hope that he can draw on Spock's brain for assistance, I instructed Dr.<br> McCoy to give priority to connecting Spock's vocal chords.<br> - Well? - He's dying and I can't stop it.<br> Yes.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy? - Spock? If you'll finish reconnecting my speech centre, I might be able to help.<br> Speech centre.<br> Yes.<br> That's correct.<br> One thing at a time.<br> That's better.<br> Now, doctor, try the sonic separator.<br> Sonic separator Yes, I believe I already have some sensation of feeling.<br> Please stimulate the nerve endings and observe the physical reactions one by one.<br> In each case, I shall tell you when the probe is correct.<br> You will then seal using the trilaser connector.<br> Trilaser connector.<br> - Ready? - Ready.<br> Right forefinger.<br> Correct.<br> Right wrist.<br> Correct.<br> Right elbow.<br> Correct.<br> Very good, doctor.<br> I'll never live this down.<br> This Vulcan is telling me how to operate.<br> - Closed.<br> - Well? How would I know? I could've made a thousand mistakes.<br> Sealing nerve endings.<br> Joining ganglia.<br> The fluid balance is correct, but I don't know.<br> Congratulations, doctor.<br> And thank you.<br> How do you feel, Spock? On the whole, captain, I believe I am quite fit.<br> Fascinating.<br> A remarkable example of a retrograde civilisation.<br> At the peak, advanced beyond any of our capabilities, and now operating at this primitive level, which you saw.<br> And it all began thousands of years ago, when a glacial age reoccurred.<br> You see, this underground complex was developed for the women.<br> The men remained above.<br> Then a male-female schism took place.<br> A fascinating cultural development of a kind I knew it was wrong.<br> - I shouldn't have done it.<br> - What's that? I should've never reconnected his mouth.<br> Well, we took the risk, doctor.<br> As I was saying, a fascinating cultural development of a kind which hasn't been seen in ages.<br> The last such occurrence took place on old Earth when the Romans   <br>\n                </div>",

No, sir.<br> Compliance presents no problem.<br> Then, Mr.<br> Spock, comply.<br> Sensor scan to one-half parsec.<br> - Negative, captain.<br> - Very well.<br> I can find no reason for the captain's behaviour except, possibly, that we've been on patrol too long without relief and diversion.<br> He has resisted all my attempts to run a psychological profile on him.<br> Maintaining course and speed, sir.<br> Change course.<br> Come about to 185 mark 3.<br> But that will lead us directly into the Romulan Neutral Zone.<br> That's very perceptive, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> I know where the course change takes us.<br> Execute.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Increasing sensor scan to one parsec.<br> All scanners report clear and nothing in our immediate vicinity.<br> Better and better, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Captain, leaving neutral zone, now entering Romulan space.<br> Very well, Mister Sulu.<br> Lieutenant.<br> When did the order come through? - Order? - From Starfleet.<br> The order to enter the neutral zone.<br> There's been no order I know of, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> But surely the captain couldn't be doing this on his own authority? If you two have any complaints, you can bring them out into the open.<br> That's a Klingon ship.<br> But it couldn't be, not in this area.<br> Intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.<br> Sound red alert, man battle stations.<br> Stand by main phasers.<br> Battle stations, all hands, battle stations.<br> A second ship has appeared.<br> Correction.<br> There are now three.<br> We are surrounded.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds.<br> To seek out new life and new civilizations.<br> To boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, code a message to Starfleet Command.<br> Advise them of our situation, include all log entries to this point.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, your sensors read clear.<br> What happened? - I have a theory, captain - Captain Kirk.<br> I'm receiving Class 2 signal from the Romulan vessel.<br> Put it on the viewing screen, lieutenant, and complete that message to Starfleet Command.<br> You have been identified as the Starship Enterprise.<br> Captain James T.<br> Kirk, last known to be in command.<br> Your information is correct.<br> This is Captain Kirk.<br> I am Sub-Commander Tal of the Romulan fleet.<br> Your ship is surrounded, captain.<br> You will surrender immediately or we will destroy you.<br> Lieutenant.<br> They want something or they would have destroyed us by now.<br> True, captain.<br> That would be standard Romulan procedure.<br> It's my ship they want.<br> And very badly.<br> It would be a great prize.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Save your threats.<br> If you board this ship, I'll blow it up.<br> You'll gain nothing.<br> - Who is that beside you? - My first officer, Commander Spock.<br> Vulcan.<br> Yes, commander.<br> Yes, commander.<br> No one should decide quickly to die, captain.<br> We give you one of your hours.<br> If you do not surrender your ship at the end of that time your destruction is certain.<br> We will be open to communication, should you wish it.<br> You understand that Starfleet Command has been advised of the situation.<br> A sub-space message will take three weeks to reach Starfleet.<br> The decision is yours, captain.<br> One hour.<br> The design of the ship is the same.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you said you had a theory on why your sensors didn't pick up the new ships until they were upon us? I believe the Romulans have developed a cloaking device which renders our tracking sensors useless.<br> If so, the Romulans could attack into Federation territory before we knew they were there, before a vessel or a planet could even begin to get their defences up.<br> They caught us, right enough.<br> That's a brilliant observation, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Do you have other helpful opinions? - Well, we've not got many choices.<br> - We have three.<br> We can fight and be destroyed.<br> Or we can destroy the Enterprise ourselves and keep her from the Romulans or we can surrender.<br> Opinions, gentlemen? If the Enterprise is taken by the Romulans they'll know everything there is to know about a starship.<br> If we had not crossed the neutral zone on your order you would not now need our opinions to support a decision which should never have had to be made.<br> Jim, you ordered us? You had no authority.<br> - Dismissed, doctor.<br> - Jim.<br> I said dismissed.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> The Romulan vessel is signalling again, sir.<br> - Put them on the screen.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> My commander wishes to speak with you, Captain Kirk.<br> - Put him on.<br> - The commander wishes to see you and your first officer aboard this vessel.<br> It is felt this matter requires discussion.<br> Why should we walk right into your hands? Two of my officers will beam aboard your vessel as exchanged hostages while you are here.<br> What guarantee do we have that they'll beam aboard our ship once we're on yours? Granted, we do not easily trust each other, captain.<br> But you are the ones who violated our territory.<br> Should it not be we who distrust your motives? However, we agree to simultaneous exchange.<br> Give us your transporter coordinates.<br> We're beaming aboard.<br> One final order, Engineer Scott.<br> If we do not return the Enterprise must not be taken.<br> If the Romulans attempt it, you're to fight and if necessary destroy yourselves, is that clear? Perfectly clear.<br> Energize.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Commander, I'm honoured.<br> I don't think so.<br> But we have an important matter to discuss.<br> And your superficial courtesies are an overture to that discussion.<br> You are the first officer.<br> Spock.<br> I speak first with the captain.<br> You may wait outside.<br> The matter of trespass into Romulan space is one of galactic import, a violation of treaties.<br> Now, I ask you simply what is your mission here? Instrument failure caused navigational error.<br> We were across the neutral zone before we realized it.<br> We were surrounded by your ships before we could get back.<br> A starship, one of the Starfleet's finest vessels.<br> You are saying instrument failure as radical as you suggest went unnoticed until you were well past the neutral zone? Accidents can happen, cut-off, back-up systems can malfunction.<br> We were due for an overhaul months ago.<br> I see.<br> But you were able to navigate with this malfunction? The error was corrected.<br> But I doubt if it will clear you of espionage.<br> We were not spying, commander.<br> Your language has always been most difficult for me, captain.<br> Perhaps you have another word for it? You are grossly mistaken if you think that we were there - You listen to me - If a Romulan vessel ventured far into Federation territory without good explanation what would a starbase commander do? You see, it works both ways.<br> I hardly believe you are the injured party.<br> Spock.<br> Come in.<br> The captain has made his statement.<br> I understand.<br> I must admit some surprise on seeing you, Spock.<br> We were not aware of Vulcans aboard the Enterprise.<br> Starfleet is not in the habit of informing Romulans of its ships' personnel.<br> Quite so.<br> Yet there are certain ships, certain officers that are known to us.<br> Your situation appears most interesting.<br> What earns Spock your special interest? He is a Vulcan.<br> Our forebears had the same roots and origins, something you wouldn't understand, captain.<br> We can appreciate the Vulcans, our distant brothers.<br> I have heard of Vulcan integrity and personal honour.<br> There is a well-known saying, or is it a myth, that Vulcans are incapable of lying.<br> It is no myth.<br> Then tell me truthfully, now, by your honour as a Vulcan, what was your mission? I reserve the privilege of speaking only when it will not violate my honour as a Vulcan.<br> It is unworthy of a Vulcan to resort to subterfuge.<br> You're being clever, commander.<br> That is unworthy of a Romulan.<br> It is not a lie to keep the truth to oneself.<br> Then there is a truth here that remains unspoken.<br> You've been told everything, there's nothing else to say.<br> There is Mr.<br> Spock's unspoken truth.<br> You knew of the cloaking device that we have developed.<br> You deliberately violated Romulan space with a blatant spy mission by order of the Federation Command.<br> - We've been all through that.<br> - We have not even begun.<br> There is no force that I can use on a Vulcan that will make him speak.<br> That is a fact.<br> But there are Romulan methods completely effective against humans and human weaknesses.<br> You would not resort to them, commander.<br> They would prove ineffective against the captain.<br> Then they will leave him dead, or what might be worse than dead.<br> But I will know your unspoken truths.<br> Let her rant.<br> There's nothing to say.<br> I cannot allow the captain to be further destroyed.<br> The strain of command has worn heavily upon him.<br> - He's not been himself for weeks.<br> - That's a lie.<br> As you can see, Captain Kirk is a highly sensitive and emotional person.<br> I believe he has lost the capacity for rational decision.<br> - Shut up, Spock.<br> - I am betraying no secrets.<br> The commander's suspicion that Starfleet ordered the Enterprise into the neutral zone is unacceptable.<br> Our rapid capture demonstrates its foolhardiness.<br> You filthy liar.<br> I am speaking the truth for the benefit of the Enterprise and the Federation.<br> I say now and for the record that Captain Kirk ordered the Enterprise across the neutral zone on his own initiative and his craving for glory.<br> I'll kill you for this, you traitor, I'll kill you.<br> - I'll kill you.<br> - He is not sane.<br> Attention, Enterprise.<br> I am speaking to you from the Romulan flagship.<br> The U.<br>S.<br>S.<br> Enterprise, under command of Captain James T.<br> Kirk is formally charged with espionage.<br> The testimony of First Officer Spock was highly instrumental in confirming this intrusion into Romulan space was not an accident.<br> First Officer Spock's testimony was specific that your ship was not under orders from Starfleet Command or the Federation Council to perform such a spy mission.<br> It was Captain Kirk who was solely responsible.<br> Since the crew had no choice but to obey orders the crew will not be held responsible.<br> Therefore, I am ordering Engineer Scott, presently in command of the Enterprise, to follow the Romulan flagship to our home base.<br> You will there be processed and released to Federation Command.<br> Until judgment is passed, Captain Kirk will be held in confinement.<br> Security.<br> Put our two Romulan hostages in the brig.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, give me a channel to that ship.<br> Channel is open, Mr.<br> Scott, and you are tied in.<br> This is Lieutenant Commander Scott.<br> The Enterprise takes no orders except those of Captain Kirk.<br> And we will stay right here until he returns.<br> And if you make any attempt to board or commandeer the Enterprise, it will be blown to bits along with as many of you as we can take with us.<br> You humans make a brave noise.<br> There are ways to convince you of your errors.<br> Did you hear that, you coward? You've betrayed everything of value you ever knew.<br> Did you hear the sound of human integrity? Take him to the security room.<br> A Vulcan among humans, living, working with them.<br> I would think the situation would be intolerable to you.<br> I am half-Vulcan.<br> My mother is a human.<br> To whom is your allegiance then? Do you call yourself Terran or Vulcan? Vulcan.<br> How long have you been a Starfleet officer, Spock? - Eighteen years.<br> - And you serve Captain Kirk.<br> Do you like him? Do you like your shipmates? - The question is irrelevant.<br> - Possibly.<br> But you are subordinate to Captain Kirk's orders, even to his whims.<br> My duty as an officer is to obey him.<br> You are a superior being.<br> Why do you not command? I do not desire a ship of my own.<br> Or is it that no one has offered you, a Vulcan, that opportunity? Such opportunities are extremely rare.<br> For someone with your capabilities and accomplishments, opportunities are made.<br> And will be.<br> I will see to that if you will stop looking on the Federation as the whole universe.<br> It is not, you know.<br> That thought has occasionally crossed my mind.<br> You must have your own ship.<br> Commander, shall we speak plainly? It is you who desperately need a ship.<br> You want the Enterprise.<br> Of course.<br> It would be a great achievement for me to bring home the Enterprise intact.<br> It would broaden the scope of my powers greatly.<br> It would be the achievement of a lifetime.<br> And it would open equal opportunities for you.<br> Bridge to Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - McCoy here.<br> - Doctor, you must beam aboard the Romulan flagship immediately.<br> There's been an injury.<br> - I don't make house calls.<br> - Doctor, it's Captain Kirk.<br> He'll recover, but he'll need further attention.<br> Inform your superior.<br> Yes? I'll come there.<br> Attend me.<br> I neglected to mention, I'll expect you for dinner.<br> - We have much to discuss.<br> - Indeed? Allow me to rephrase.<br> Will you join me for dinner? I am honoured, commander.<br> Are the guards also invited? Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That corridor is forbidden to all but loyal Romulans.<br> Of course.<br> I shall obey your restrictions.<br> I hope that one day there will be no need for you to observe any restrictions.<br> It would be illogical to assume that all conditions remain stable.<br> - Are you the doctor? - McCoy.<br> Chief medical officer.<br> Captain Kirk's condition? Well, you can see for yourself.<br> He's mentally depressed, physically weak, disoriented, displays feelings of persecution and rebellion.<br> Then by your own standards of normality, this man is not fully competent.<br> No, not now.<br> Mr.<br> Spock has stated that he believes the captain had no authority or order to cross the neutral zone.<br> Could this mental incapacity have afflicted him earlier? Yes, it's possible.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the doctor has now confirmed your testimony.<br> As to the mental state of your captain, he was and is unfit to continue in command of the Enterprise.<br> That duty has now fallen on you.<br> Are you ready to exercise that function? - I am ready.<br> - Spock, I don't believe it.<br> There's no price you could pay that would make him sell out.<br> The matter is not open for discussion, doctor.<br> - What do you mean the matter is.<br>.<br>? - That's enough, doctor.<br> As a physician, your duty is to save lives.<br> Mr.<br> Spock's duty is to lead the Enterprise and its crew to a safe haven.<br> There is no alternative, doctor.<br> The safety of the crew is now the paramount issue.<br> It is misguided loyalty to resist any further.<br> You traitor.<br> I'll kill you.<br> I'll kill you.<br> What did you do? What did you do? I was unprepared for his attack.<br> I instinctively used the Vulcan death grip.<br> Your instincts are still good, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The captain is dead.<br> Doctor! Dr.<br> McCoy! Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I left orders that no one was to come in here.<br> - He's alive.<br> Alive.<br> - Well, now that you know it, you might as well assist me.<br> Hand me the physio-stimulator.<br> But he was dead.<br> Their doctors certified he was dead.<br> Spock gave him a nerve pinch to simulate death.<br> Then Mr.<br> Spock isn't a traitor.<br> And you knew that all the time and you didn't I didn't know it until I beamed aboard the Romulan ship.<br> Jim and Spock were operating under Federation orders.<br> My neck feels like it's been twisted off.<br> That's the Vulcan death grip for you.<br> There's no such thing as a Vulcan death grip.<br> Oh, but the Romulans don't know that.<br> Sure fooled the doctors.<br> You took a big chance that they didn't start an autopsy.<br> As far as the rest of crew is concerned, I'm still dead.<br> Why? That's what this whole masquerade was about.<br> To keep the Enterprise and the Federation off the hook.<br> So that if any thing went wrong you would be the one to blame.<br> Bones.<br> I want you to prepare for surgery.<br> What for? Sickbay to Bridge.<br> Scott here, doctor.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, will you report to Sickbay? Sickbay? I can't leave the Bridge at a time like this.<br> You have to, it's urgent.<br> We're surrounded by enemy vessels ready to attack us, I don't know of anything more urgent than that.<br> Well, I do.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, please.<br> All right, doctor.<br> It better be important.<br> Scott out.<br> All right, doctor, what's so urgent that Captain.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Yes.<br> Well, you look like the devil, himself, but as long as you're alive.<br> What's it all about? Are those Romulan officers still aboard the ship? They are in the brig, sir.<br> I'll need a Romulan uniform.<br> Aye.<br> It will be a pleasure.<br> I've had special Vulcan dishes prepared for you.<br> I hope they're to your liking.<br> I'm very flattered, commander.<br> There is no doubt that the cuisine aboard your vessel is far superior to that of the Enterprise.<br> It is, indeed, a very powerful recruiting inducement.<br> We have other inducements.<br> What the devil is Spock doing? What's delaying him? I wish I knew.<br> Scotty, are you sure we have a clear channel to Spock? Aye, sir.<br> No doubt of it.<br> Then we can't wait any longer.<br> Prepare to beam me aboard the flagship.<br> But Mr.<br> Spock hasn't set the proper coordinates yet.<br> - Can't be helped, Scotty.<br> - You're taking an awful chance, Jim.<br> Just don't put me inside a bulkhead.<br> Energize.<br> Centurion, I'm sorry, no one is allowed I have just effected an escape from the Federation vessel.<br> I have information for Sub-Commander Tal.<br> Where is he? He's in control central, centurion.<br> Good.<br> I shall mention your alertness to him.<br> Return to your duty.<br> Thank you, centurion.<br> You have nothing in Starfleet to which to return.<br> I off We offer you an alternative.<br> We will find a place for you, if you wish it.<br> A place? With me.<br> Romulan women are not like Vulcan females.<br> We are not dedicated to pure logic and the sterility of non-emotion.<br> Our people are warriors, often savage.<br> But we are also many other pleasant things.<br> I was not aware of that aspect of Romulan society.<br> As a Vulcan, you would study it.<br> As a human, you would find ways to appreciate it.<br> Please believe me, I do appreciate it.<br> I am so glad.<br> Now, one final step to make the occasion complete.<br> You will lead a small party of Romulans aboard the Enterprise.<br> And there you will take your rightful place as its commander.<br> And you will lead the ship to a Romulan port, with my flagship at its side.<br> Yes, of course.<br> But not just this moment.<br> An hour from now will do even better.<br> Would it not, commander? Yes.<br> Yes, it will.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You do know I have a first name.<br> I was beginning to wonder.<br> Well, I do.<br> Would you like to hear it? How rare and how beautiful.<br> But so incongruous when spoken by a soldier.<br> If you will give me a moment, the soldier will transform herself into a woman.<br> - Spock to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Captain, are you prepared to beam over? I'm already on board, Spock.<br> Do you have the information? Yes, captain.<br> The cloaking device is in an area near the commander's quarters.<br> It is closely guarded and off-limits to all but authorized personnel.<br> What is your present location? Sub-commander Tal.<br> I'm receiving an alien transmission from within our vessel, sir.<br> - Alien? Are you certain? - Yes, sub-commander.<br> - I must know the source.<br> - Triangulating now, sir.<br> Spock, I'll get the cloaking device.<br> Will you be able to get back to the Enterprise without attracting their attention? Unknown, captain.<br> At present, I'm rather heavily Is my attire now more appropriate, Mr.<br> Spock? Commander, your attire is not only more appropriate, it should actually stimulate our conversation.<br> Centurion.<br> Have you clearance for this area? I do not recognize you.<br> There's an intruder aboard.<br> Has someone tried to gain entrance? - I must see your authorization, sir.<br> - Over there.<br> It's hard to believe that I could be so moved by the touch of an alien hand.<br> I must confess that I, too, am moved emotionally.<br> I know it is illogical Mr.<br> Spock, we mustn't question what we truly feel.<br> Accept what is happening between us, even as I do.<br> Commander.<br> Permission to enter.<br> Not now, Tal.<br> It is urgent, commander.<br> Enter.<br> Commander.<br> We have intercepted an alien transmission.<br> Locate its source.<br> We have, commander.<br> This room.<br> The cloaking device.<br> Bring him.<br> Hold.<br> Don't move.<br> Who are you? What are you doing in here? There's an enemy spy aboard.<br> He'll be after the cloaking device.<br> Drop your weapon.<br> Scotty, energize.<br> But, sir, what about Mr.<br> Spock? Hope he can buy us enough time to get this cloaking device installed.<br> It'll have to be hooked into our deflector-shield control.<br> - Can you do it? - I don't know.<br> You have 15 minutes, Scotty.<br> Commander, the cloaking device is gone.<br> Full alert.<br> Search all decks.<br> That will be profitless, commander.<br> I do not believe you will find it.<br> You must be mad.<br> I assure you, I am quite sane.<br> Why would you do this to me? What are you that you could do this? First Officer of the Enterprise.<br> What is your present form of execution? Captain's Log, stardate 5027.<br>4.<br> Commander Scott has less than 15 minutes to install the Romulans' cloaking device and get it working.<br> I hope Mr.<br> Spock can buy us the time we need.<br> - Captain.<br> - You're alive.<br> - They said you'd been killed, sir.<br> - The report was premature.<br> - Captain, your ears, what happened? - We'll discuss it later.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, lay in a course for home.<br> Chekov, take the sensors.<br> Mr.<br> Spock is still aboard the Romulan flagship.<br> I want his body readings pinpointed and isolated.<br> That was not a request, gentlemen.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Return to your station, sub-commander.<br> The boarding action on the Enterprise will begin with my command.<br> If they resist, destroy her.<br> Execution of state criminals is both painful and unpleasant.<br> I believe the details are unnecessary.<br> The sentence will be carried out immediately after the charges have been recorded.<br> I demand the Right of Statement first.<br> You understand Romulan tradition well.<br> The right is granted.<br> Thank you.<br> I shall not require much time.<br> No more than 20 minutes, I should say.<br> It should take less time than that to find your ally who stole the cloaking device.<br> You will not die alone.<br> Recording the Romulan Right of Statement.<br> Proceed, Commander Spock.<br> My crime is sabotage.<br> I freely admit my guilt.<br> The oath I swore as a Starfleet officer is both specific and binding.<br> As long as I wear the uniform, my duty is to protect the security of the Federation.<br> Clearly, your new cloaking device is a threat to that security.<br> I carried out my duty.<br> Everyone carries out his duty.<br> You state the obvious, Spock.<br> There is no regulation regarding the content of my statement.<br> May I continue? Very well.<br> Your 20 minutes is almost up.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, there is only one Vulcan aboard that ship, he should be easy enough to locate.<br> Romulans and Vulcans appear to read almost exactly alike.<br> There is just a slight difference which Got him, sir.<br> Feed the coordinates to the transporter room on the double.<br> Have them prepare to beam him aboard on my signal.<br> Captain Kirk, Mr.<br> Scott is on the intercom for you, sir.<br> Go ahead, Scotty.<br> I've got the device installed.<br> But bless me if I know if it's going to work.<br> It's the biggest guess I've ever made.<br> - Stand by, Scotty.<br> - Sir.<br> Transporter room has the coordinates and is ready for beaming.<br> Transporter room, beam Mr.<br> Spock aboard.<br> Beyond the historic tradition of Vulcan loyalty there is also the combined Romulan-Vulcan history of obedience to duty.<br> Transporter room reports Mr.<br> Spock aboard, sir.<br> And the Romulan commander.<br> - The commander? - Aye, sir.<br> All right.<br> Have them report to the Bridge on the double.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, take us away from the Romulans.<br> Warp factor 9.<br> Sub-Commander.<br> The enemy vessel is moving away at extreme speed, sir.<br> Alert all vessels.<br> Weapons officer, bring main batteries to bear on the Enterprise.<br> Holding at warp 9, sir.<br> Scotty, throw the switch on that device.<br> I did, sir.<br> It's not working.<br> I would give you credit, captain, for getting this far.<br> But you will be dead in a moment and the credit would be gratuitous.<br> Lieutenant, open a channel to the Romulan vessel.<br> Aye, sir.<br> I have Sub-Commander Tal, sir.<br> Establish two-way visual contact.<br> We have you under our weapons.<br> You cannot escape.<br> This is Captain Kirk.<br> Hold your fire.<br> - We have your Commander aboard.<br> - Commander.<br> Destroy this vessel.<br> I gave you a direct command, Tal.<br> Helmsman, flank speed.<br> Weapons officer, stand by to fire main batteries as soon as we reach optimum range.<br> - Scotty, we're running out of time.<br> - Captain, I'm working as fast as I can.<br> You see, captain, your effort has been wasted.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, distance from the Romulan vessel? One hundred fifty thousand kilometres, captain, and closing very rapidly.<br> Stand by, phasers.<br> Commander, you'll forgive me if I put up a fight.<br> Of course, it's expected.<br> One-hundred thousand kilometres, They should commence firing at us within the next 12.<br>7 seconds.<br> - Scotty.<br> - It's ready now, captain, but I don't know whether our circuits can handle this alien contraption.<br> - Throw the switch.<br> - It'll likely overload.<br> Throw the switch.<br> Weapons officer, commence fi Gone.<br> They have the cloaking device.<br> Quickly.<br> Compute enemy course from last position and open fire.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Sulu, come about 318 mark 7.<br> Three-one-eight mark 7, sir.<br> Executing.<br> The cloaking device is working perfectly.<br> And the commander has informed me that even the Romulans' sensors cannot track a vessel so equipped.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Cancel red alert.<br> We'll let you off at the nearest Federation outpost.<br> You are very generous, captain.<br> If I may be taken to your brig, I will take my place as your prisoner.<br> Mr.<br> Spock will have the honour of escorting you to your quarters.<br> Captain.<br> Commander.<br> Deck 2.<br> It is regrettable that you were made an unwilling passenger.<br> It was not intentional.<br> All the Federation wanted was the cloaking device.<br> The Federation? And what did you want? It was my only interest when I boarded your vessel.<br> And that's exactly all you came away with.<br> You underestimate yourself, commander.<br> You realize that very soon we will learn to penetrate the cloaking device you stole.<br> Obviously.<br> Military secrets are the most fleeting of all.<br> I hope that you and I exchanged something more permanent.<br> It was your choice.<br> It was the only choice possible.<br> You would not respect any other.<br> It will be our secret.<br> Entering neutral zone, captain.<br> Very good, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Leslie.<br> - Sickbay to Bridge.<br> - What is it, Bones? If all the shouting's over up there, I'd like for you to report to Sickbay.<br> - What for? - Well, you're due in surgery.<br> I'm going to bob your ears.<br> Captain, please go.<br> Somehow, they do not look aesthetically agreeable on humans.<br> Well, are you coming, Jim?

Astronomical, captain.<br> The relative size, age and composition of this planet makes it highly improbable that it would evolve similarly to Earth in any way.<br> What in blazes is that? - Analysis, Spock? - An alien metal of some kind.<br> An alloy resistant to probe.<br> Readings can't even measure its age accurately.<br> These incised symbols are fascinating, evidently some form of writing.<br> - Any theories about what it is? - Negative, captain, but structures of this complexity require extremely sophisticated building apparatus, the kind usually found in cultures surpassing or equalling our own.<br> Meadows and no meteor craters.<br> The whole place is an enigma, biologically and culturally.<br> What's the nearest concentration of life forms, Mr.<br> Spock? Bearing 117, mark 4.<br> And how much time did you say we have to investigate? If we are to divert the asteroid which is on a collision course with this planet, we must warp out of orbit within 30 minutes.<br> Every second we delay arriving at the deflection point compounds the problem, perhaps past solution.<br> You did say 30 minutes.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Then let's go.<br> Let's find out what life forms are blessed by this environment.<br> They look like I'd swear they're American Indians.<br> They are, doctor.<br> A mixture of Navajo, Mohican and Delaware, I believe.<br> All among the more advanced and peaceful tribes.<br> It's like discovering Atlantis.<br> Or Shangri-la.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, is it possible there's a more evolved civilisation somewhere else on this planet? One capable of building that obelisk or developing a deflector system? Highly improbable, captain.<br> Sensor probes indicate only one type of life form here.<br> Shouldn't we contact them, Jim? Tell them? Tell them what? An asteroid's coming to smash their world into atoms? Too primitive to grasp the concept of space flight, doctor.<br> Our appearance here would only serve to confuse and frighten them.<br> We've got a job to do.<br> Let's get back to the Enterprise.<br> - What's the matter, Jim? - What? Oh, nothing.<br> It's just so peaceful.<br> Uncomplicated.<br> No problems, no command decisions.<br> Just living.<br> Typical human reaction to an idyllic natural setting.<br> Back in the 20th century, we referred to it as the Tahiti Syndrome.<br> It's particularly common to overpressured leader types, like starship captains.<br> Tahiti Syndrome.<br> Let's go take care of that asteroid.<br> But first I want another look at that obelisk.<br> - Doctor? - Yes? I suggest that any further research on your part be delayed until after we have diverted the asteroid.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4842.<br>6.<br> First Officer Spock commanding.<br> Numerous search parties and repeated sensor probes of the area have failed to locate Captain Kirk.<br> - Spock to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise.<br> Come in, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Prepare to beam us up, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> We're warping out of orbit.<br> Leaving? You can't be serious, Spock.<br> Doctor, that asteroid is almost as large as your Earth's moon.<br> Far enough away, the angle necessary to divert it enough to avoid destruction is minute.<br> But as the asteroid approaches this planet, the angle becomes so great that even the power of a starship The devil with an asteroid! It won't get here for two months, Spock.<br> If we arrive at the deflection point in time, it may not get here at all.<br> In the meantime, what about Jim? Once the asteroid has been diverted, we'll return here and resume the search.<br> That may be hours from now.<br> He may be injured or dying.<br> Doctor.<br> Assume this is the planet we're on.<br> This is the approaching asteroid.<br> It we don't get to that deflection point in time, it will become physically impossible to divert this asteroid.<br> In that case, everyone on this planet will die, including the captain.<br> Can a few more minutes matter, Spock? In the time it has taken me to explain the problem, the asteroid has moved from here to here.<br> The longer we delay, the less the likelihood of being able to divert it.<br> Beam us up, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Where am I? What place is this? What are these? I feel I should know.<br> They're familiar, and yet unfamiliar.<br> How did I get here? Who am I? Try to remember.<br> Wait.<br> Who are you? We are your people.<br> We've been waiting for you to come to us.<br> Captain's log, stardate 4843.<br>6.<br> First Officer Spock commanding.<br> We've been en route to the asteroid for several hours.<br> Our delay on the planet's surface has made it imperative that we proceed at maximum warp speed for a period which exceeds the recommended safety margin.<br> I can't give you warp 9 much longer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> These engines are beginning to show signs of stress.<br> Stress or not, we cannot reduce speed.<br> I do not intend to miss that deflection point.<br> All right.<br> But we're moving further into the danger range all the time.<br> Every Objection noted, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Carry on.<br> Miramanee has said that you appeared to her and to her handmaiden from the walls of the temple, just as our legend foretells.<br> We do not doubt the words of our priestess, but these are troubled times and we must be sure.<br> I'll answer anything I can, but as I told you, many things are strange to me.<br> He knows nothing about danger.<br> How can he save us? It is against custom to interrupt a tribal elder at council, even for the medicine chief.<br> Elder, words will not save us when the skies darken.<br> We must be certain.<br> I say he must prove he is a god.<br> Our skies have darkened three times since the harvest, the last time worst of all.<br> Our legend predicts such danger and promises that the Wise Ones who planted us here will send a god to save us, one who can rouse the temple spirit and make the sky grow quiet.<br> Can you do this? I came from the temple, as Miramanee said, and it was a beginning for me.<br> Here.<br> But I came from the sky too.<br> Only, I can't remember.<br> I can't remember.<br> Salish, a terrible thing has happened.<br> The boy was attending the fishnets and he became entangled in them and sank to the bottom of the river.<br> Lumo brought him up quickly, but he doesn't move.<br> There is no sound in the body.<br> There is no light in the eyes.<br> - He will move no more.<br> - Wait a moment.<br> Wait.<br> - He'll be all right now.<br> - My people are grateful.<br> It's a simple technique.<br> Goes way back Way back Only a god can breathe life into the dead.<br> Do you still question? Give him the medicine badge.<br> Deflection point minus seven.<br> Full power, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> The relays will reject the overload, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Then bypass the relays, go to manual control.<br> - Do that, we'll burn out the engines.<br> - I want full power, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Aye, sir.<br> All right, you lovelies, hold together.<br> Full power, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Magnification factor 12, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Deflection point minus four.<br> All engines stop.<br> Hold position here.<br> All engines stopped, sir.<br> - Prepare to activate deflectors.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Power dropping, sir.<br> Engineering, maintain full power.<br> Full power.<br> Dilithium crystal circuit is failing, sir.<br> We have to replace it.<br> - Not now.<br> - Zero.<br> Deflection point.<br> Now, sir.<br> Activate deflectors.<br> Power dropping, sir.<br> Degree of deflection, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Not enough, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It's only 0.<br>0013 degrees.<br> Recircuit power to engines.<br> - Max speed, heading 37, mark 010.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> That will put us directly in the asteroid's path.<br> Correct, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> I intend to retreat in front of that asteroid until we can employ all power on phaser beams.<br> - What for? - To destroy it.<br> A narrow beam concentrated on a single spot will split that mass.<br> It might also cripple the ship, and we would be crushed by the asteroid.<br> Incorrect.<br> We'll still be able to get out of its path by use of impulse power.<br> Jim won't be able to get out of its path.<br> That, doctor, is another calculated risk we must take.<br> Miramanee.<br> What are you doing? I must see to the needs of the god, as is my duty.<br> You should be working on our ritual cloak.<br> There will be no ritual between us now, Salish.<br> What do you mean? We cannot go against tradition.<br> It is because of tradition that I cannot marry you.<br> But you are promised to me.<br> That was before he came.<br> Tribal priestess and medicine chief are always joined.<br> He is medicine chief now.<br> Salish, choose another.<br> Any maiden would be honoured to join with you.<br> I wish no other.<br> You have no choice.<br> Miramanee, if you could choose, would you choose me? Perhaps you would like to bathe now.<br> Miramanee, tell me about the Wise Ones.<br> Tell? But a god knows everything.<br> Not this one.<br> Tell me.<br> The Wise Ones brought us here from far away.<br> They chose a medicine chief to keep the secret of the temple and to use it when the sky darkens.<br> Secrets of the temple.<br> There are no lacings.<br> How is this thing removed? The secrets were passed on from father to son? Yes.<br> How does this open? Well, why doesn't Salish use it? Why are the people in danger? His father did not wish to share his power too soon.<br> He died before he told Salish the secret.<br> Our people rejoice, and wish to honour your name.<br> But I did not know what you wished to be called.<br> What may I tell them? Ki Kir K Kirok? - Have we displeased you? - No, no.<br> Everything is fine.<br> Then it must be ourselves, the way we live.<br> Perhaps we have not improved as quickly as the Wise Ones wish.<br> Your land is rich, your people happy.<br> Who could be displeased with that? But there is something.<br> Tell us.<br> We will change it.<br> I can't tell you anything.<br> All I can tell you is that I'm happy and peaceful here.<br> I'm not sure, but I think I've never felt that way before.<br> Why are they so sure I can help them? Well, you came from the stone metal.<br> - And did you not bring life to the child? - Yes, but I I need time to remember.<br> Here, there is much time.<br> For everything.<br> - Coordinates, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Tau 8.<br>7, Beta 0.<br>041.<br> That is our target.<br> The asteroid's weakest point.<br> Almost dead centre, sir.<br> Lock all phasers on that mark.<br> Maximum intensity, narrow beam.<br> I want to split that fissure wide open.<br> You sound like you're cutting a diamond.<br> - Very astute, doctor.<br> - All phasers locked, sir.<br> We'll fire in sequence and continue firing as long as Mr.<br> Scott can maintain power.<br> - Standing by, sir.<br> - Fire phasers.<br> Phaser 1 firing.<br> That Vulcan won't be satisfied till these panels are a puddle of lead.<br> Phaser 2 firing.<br> Main relay's out again, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Phaser 4 firing.<br> - All phasers fired, sir.<br> - Rig for simultaneous firing, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Commence simultaneous bombardment.<br> My bairns.<br> My poor bairns.<br> The ritual cloak is finished.<br> If it pleases you, I would like to name the Joining day.<br> The Joining day? I'm the daughter of the chief.<br> Tribal law betroths me to our leader.<br> If there is another, I will step aside.<br> No, Miramanee, there is no one else in my mind or my heart.<br> God's wish is above tribal law.<br> Name the Joining day.<br> The sooner our happiness together begins, the longer it will last.<br> - Tomorrow.<br> - Tomorrow.<br> And don't ask for any more warp 9 speeds, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Our star drive is completely burned out.<br> The only thing we have left is impulse power.<br> - Estimated repair time.<br> - Hanging here in space? Forever.<br> The only thing that will fix these poor darlings is the nearest repair base.<br> I've already surmised that.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Well, Spock, you took your calculated risk in your calculated Vulcan way and you lost.<br> You lost for us, you lost for that planet and you lost for Jim.<br> I accept the responsibility, doctor.<br> And my responsibility is the health of this crew.<br> You've been driving yourself too hard and I want you to get some rest.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, resume heading 883, mark 41.<br> Back to that planet without warp speed? Lt'll take months, Spock.<br> Exactly 59.<br>223 days, doctor.<br> And that asteroid will be four hours behind us all the way.<br> Well, then, what's the use? We might not be able to save the captain even if he still is alive.<br> We might not be able to save anything, including this ship.<br> You haven't heard a word I've said.<br> All you've been doing is staring at that blasted obelisk.<br> Another calculated Vulcan risk, doctor.<br> This Joining means the end of darkness.<br> It's a time for joy for all my people.<br> You will wait until I walk the holy path to the earth lodge first, to give me time to tell the priestess that you follow and that the Joining will take place.<br> I have found paradise.<br> Surely no man has ever attained such happiness.<br> Get out of my way, Salish.<br> Even though you be a god, Kirok, I cannot permit this Joining.<br> - Nobody's asking for your permission.<br> - Then you must strike me dead.<br> I have no intention of striking you dead.<br> You bleed.<br> You bleed, Kirok.<br> Behold a god who bleeds.<br> Behold a god who bleeds.<br> Kill me.<br> Kill me, Kirok.<br> For I will not rest until I prove to my people that you are no god.<br> I thought you were reporting to Sickbay.<br> There isn't time, doctor, I must decipher those obelisk symbols.<br> They're a highly advanced form of cipher writing.<br> You've been trying to do that ever since we started back to that planet.<br> - Fifty-eight days.<br> - I'm aware of that, doctor.<br> I'm also aware that when we arrive at the planet we'll have barely four hours to effect rescue.<br> I believe those symbols are the key.<br> Well, you won't read them by killing yourself.<br> You've hardly eaten or slept for weeks.<br> Now, if you don't let up, you're gonna collapse.<br> I am not hungry, doctor.<br> And under stress, we Vulcans can do without sleep for weeks.<br> Well, your Vulcan metabolism is so low it can hardly be measured and as for the pressure, that green ice water you call blood My physical condition is not important, doctor.<br> That obelisk is.<br> Well, my diagnosis is exhaustion brought on from overwork and guilt.<br> You're blaming yourself for crippling this ship, just as we blamed you.<br> Well, we were wrong.<br> So were you.<br> You made a command decision.<br> Jim would have done the same.<br> My prescription is rest.<br> Now, do I have to call the security guards to enforce it? Miramanee? Come here.<br> Miramanee? Each time your arms hold me is as joyous as the first.<br> I'm happy.<br> I'm so happy.<br> If it weren't for the dreams, my mind would be completely at peace.<br> I thought you no longer had the dreams, that you no longer saw the strange lodge which moves through the sky.<br> They've come back.<br> They were gone for a while, but they've come back.<br> And I see faces too.<br> Very dim.<br> I feel I should know them.<br> I feel my place is with them.<br> Not here.<br> I don't deserve this happiness.<br> I have a gift for you.<br> A gift? What? It may make you happy.<br> Wait.<br> These last few weeks, my love for Miramanee grows stronger with each passing day.<br> However, the dreams return every night.<br> Fragments of memories.<br> I can almost get hold of them.<br> And then I bear your child.<br> You.<br> A canal.<br> And with it, we'll bring the water from the lake right to the lodge.<br> And we can expand the system and irrigate the fields and double the food supply.<br> And with the power of the lamp - Lamp? - Lamp.<br> - Which turns night into day, we can cook twice as much food and, as you taught us, pre - Preserve.<br> - Preserve.<br> - Preserve.<br> Famine.<br> - For times of famine.<br> That is why you made the lamp, Kirok.<br> So that I would never know when it was night and I'd be forever cooking.<br> Oh, no.<br> No, no, no.<br> That's not why I made the lamp at all, to keep you forever cooking.<br> It's only the wind and the thunder.<br> I act like a stupid child.<br> I have nothing to fear.<br> You are here.<br> - It is time.<br> - Time? To go to the temple.<br> People will be waiting.<br> - Why? - To save them.<br> But it's only the wind.<br> The wind can't harm them.<br> The wind is only the beginning.<br> Soon, the sky will darken.<br> The lake will go wild and the earth will tremble.<br> Only you can save us.<br> But I can't do anything about the wind or the sky.<br> If we do not go now, it will be too late.<br> You must go inside the temple and make the blue flame come out.<br> I don't know how to get inside the temple.<br> But you are a god.<br> Kirok! Kirok! Why are you not at the temple, Kirok? Soon, the ground will begin to tremble.<br> The people need your help.<br> We'll go to the caves.<br> It will be safe there.<br> The caves? Surely a legend can do more than that for his people.<br> When the ground trembles, the caves are not safe, Kirok.<br> If you do not rouse the temple spirit, we will all die.<br> There is nothing you cannot do, my husband.<br> Well, what do you wait for, god? Your robes? Take care of Miramanee.<br> I am Kirok! I have come! I am Kirok! - I prescribed sleep.<br> - You prescribed rest, doctor.<br> The symbols on the obelisk are not words, they are musical notes.<br> Musical notes? You mean, it's nothing but a song? In a way, yes.<br> Other cultures, among them certain Vulcan offshoots, use musical notes as words.<br> The tones correspond roughly to an alphabet.<br> Were you able to make any sense of the symbols? Yes, the obelisk is a marker, just as I thought.<br> It was left by a super race known as the Preservers.<br> They passed through the galaxy rescuing primitive cultures which were in danger of extinction and seeding them, so to speak, where they could live and grow.<br> I've always wondered why there were so many humanoids scattered through the galaxy.<br> So have I.<br> Apparently, the Preservers account for a number of them.<br> That's probably how the planet has survived all these centuries.<br> The Preservers put an asteroid deflector on the planet.<br> Which has now become defective and is failing to operate.<br> And we have to find that deflector and put it back into working order.<br> - Otherwise - Precisely, doctor.<br> There's the false one! Die! Die! No! No! Don't hurt him! - Miramanee! - Don't hurt him! - Go back! - He's false! - I belong to him.<br> - Then go.<br> Go die with your false god.<br> - You'll be killed! - Traitor! Kill him! Die as we all do! Die, impostor! - You lied to us! - Kill him! You're not a god! I need Nurse Chapel.<br> - Spock to Enterprise.<br> - Come in, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We've located the captain.<br> Beam down Nurse Chapel with an emergency surgical kit.<br> My wife.<br> Is she all right? - Wife? - Hallucinations? Jim.<br> Miramanee.<br> Miramanee.<br> The nurse has given you something to ease the pain.<br> Why were you being stoned? Kirok could not get back into the temple.<br> Naturally, since he did not come from there.<br> I saw him come - Does he recognise us? - His brain is unimpaired.<br> Everything else is functioning normally except his memory.<br> - Can you help him? - It would take time.<br> Time, Dr.<br> McCoy, is the one thing we do not have in abundance.<br> - Spock here.<br> - Tracking report, sir.<br> Sixty-five minutes to end of safety margin.<br> Report noted.<br> Doctor, is he strong enough for the Vulcan mind-fusion? We have no choice.<br> I am Spock.<br> You are James Kirk.<br> Our minds are moving closer.<br> Closer, closer, closer, James Kirk.<br> Closer.<br> No.<br> - James Kirk.<br> - Miramanee! No.<br> Miramanee.<br> Our minds are one.<br> - I am Kirok.<br> - Kirok.<br> I am Kirok.<br> I am Ki l I'm Kirok! - I am - Spock! - What is it? - His mind.<br> He's an extremely dynamic individual.<br> It worked.<br> Captain, were you inside this structure? Yes.<br> What's inside is loaded with scientific equipment.<br> This obelisk is one huge deflector mechanism.<br> It is imperative that we get inside immediately.<br> Captain, we do not have much time.<br> McCoy.<br> I don't know how to get inside.<br> If we are not able to gain entry and activate the deflector mechanism within the next 50 minutes, this entire planet will be destroyed.<br> The key must be in these symbols.<br> We've gotta decipher them.<br> I already have to some extent, captain.<br> They are musical notes.<br> You mean, entry can be gained by playing certain notes on a musical instrument? That would be one method.<br> Another would be a series of tonal qualities spoken in their proper sequence.<br> Give me your communicator.<br> Tonal control.<br> Consonants and vowels.<br> I must have hit it accidentally when I contacted the ship.<br> If you can remember your exact words, captain - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Aye, captain.<br> Scotty, if the deflector isn't activated within 20 minutes, get out of orbit.<br> Get the Enterprise out of the danger zone.<br> The landing party is expendable.<br> The Enterprise isn't.<br> Kirk out.<br> Miramanee.<br> Bones, stay with her.<br> Do what you can.<br> It is similar to deflector panels I've seen, captain, but far more complicated.<br> Careful.<br> I must have hit something accidentally.<br> A beam caught me and that's when I stopped remembering.<br> Probably a memory beam.<br> You must have activated it out of sequence.<br> More symbols.<br> Can you read them? I do have an excellent eye for musical notes, captain.<br> They would seem to indicate that this series of relays, activated in Spock, just press the right button.<br> - How is she? - She had bad internal injuries, Jim.<br> Will she live? No.<br> Kirok.<br> It is true.<br> You are safe.<br> And so are your people, Miramanee.<br> I knew you would save them, my chief.<br> When I am better, it will be as it was, will it not? If that's what you want.<br> We will live long and happy lives.<br> I will bear you many strong sons.<br> I'll love you always.<br> And I'll love you, Miramanee.<br> Always.<br> Each kiss is as the first.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I'm gonna get you.<br> - No sign of grief? - No, Jim, no indication of any kind.<br> Or fear? They seem completely secure and unafraid.<br> You insist that their behaviour is a sign of traumatic shock? I don't insist, Jim, but I can't dismiss the possibility.<br> A child suppresses the fact that both parents are dead? I can't believe it.<br> Humans do have an amazing capacity for believing what they choose and excluding that which is painful.<br> Not these children, to this extent.<br> It's incredible.<br> What these children saw is incredible, Jim.<br> The way those deaths occurred, any reaction is possible, including lacunar amnesia.<br> That's my diagnosis.<br> Until specific tests can be made, it remains that.<br> I'll be guided by that opinion, doctor, for the present.<br> What about questioning them? Not until the fabric of the traumatisation weakens or you can come up with another explanation for their behaviour.<br> Forcing them to see this experience now could cause permanent damage.<br> Accepted, doctor.<br> Be careful.<br> I'm sorry, Captain Kirk.<br> Children? Children, listen to me.<br> It's late, and it's time to go up to the ship.<br> Oh, not yet.<br> - But we're just beginning to have fun.<br> - Not now.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm sorry, you'll go up with the doctor.<br> Come on.<br> It's time to be going.<br> Whatever happened here is locked up inside those children.<br> The attack on Professor Starnes' party must surely have been unprovoked.<br> Attack? Mass suicide is what it seems to be.<br> I stand corrected, captain.<br> Induced would be a more precise term.<br> Induced by an outside force.<br> - Such as? - The release of bacteria.<br> Or a helpless mental depression and a state of suicidal anxiety could have been chemically induced.<br> What would make the children immune? I do not know.<br> But it is possible.<br> Then the children would have been exempted by conscious design.<br> A valid assumption, I would say.<br> And their present behaviour explained by a fear of punishment.<br> Or the promise of reward.<br> An attack by an unknown assailant on an uninhabited planet.<br> This planet is uninhabited, Mr.<br> Spock, to the best of our information? At present, yes.<br> - Odd.<br> - Getting a reading? There seems to be some disturbance coming from that cave.<br> Picking up any life forms, Mr.<br> Spock? Definitely not humanoid, captain.<br> Impossible to make any specific identification.<br> The readings do not correlate with any known information.<br> Oh, that's strange.<br> That's very strange.<br> I'm getting a feeling of anxiety in this place.<br> That doesn't sound very scientific, does it? But it's strongest right here.<br> I'm not aware of it, captain.<br> Maybe that's what's registering on your tricorder.<br> I am not familiar with anxiety, but I was not aware that it could be registered on sensors.<br> No.<br> Of course.<br> That's That's me.<br> That's me.<br> But what's causing your tricorder to react? - Are you all right, captain? - Yes, I'm I'm fine.<br> I'm fine.<br> Just some sympathetic vibration with what happened here.<br> Let's get back to the ship.<br> I want to check out those tapes from Professor Starnes' tricorder.<br> And I am going to question those children.<br> All right, children.<br> Now, each card is a different flavour.<br> You take your pick, and the computer will mix your favourite combination.<br> What would you like? Just call out your favourite.<br> - Chocolate.<br> - Vanilla.<br> - Cherry and banana.<br> - Okay.<br> Okay.<br> Well.<br> Would you like a surprise, Stevie? All right.<br> It's coconut and vanilla.<br> They're both white.<br> There, there, now, Stevie.<br> There are unpleasant surprises as well as pleasant ones.<br> That was your unpleasant surprise.<br> Now, what would you like for your pleasant surprise? Chocolate wobble and pistachio.<br> Well, coming right up.<br> And peach.<br> All right.<br> It's gonna be a wonderful surprise.<br> The tests show no evidence that tension is due to lying.<br> They behave as though nothing had gone wrong.<br> They check out sound physically, and there are no signs of any bio-chemical substance to account for their present state.<br> - I have no answers, Jim.<br> - There has to be an answer.<br> Can't it wait till we get to a starbase hospital so they can be checked out by a specialist? We're not leaving here until we find out what went on, or what's going on.<br> I won't prevent you questioning them, but it could harm the children if you do.<br> It could be far worse for them if I don't, and for us too.<br> Be careful.<br> - And I got another flavour on top.<br> - After this, we can all play games.<br> Yeah.<br> How do you like getting your ice cream out of a computer? - I'll eat some more before bed.<br> - That was fun.<br> Well, well, well, you're all having such a good time.<br> - I think I'll join you.<br> Is that all right? - Please do.<br> - All right.<br> I'll have a dish too.<br> - Of course.<br> A little one.<br> A very small one.<br> - It's better than Triacus, isn't it? - That dirty old planet? - What's so good about that place? - Yeah.<br> You weren't there very long.<br> You don't know.<br> I don't think your parents liked it very much either.<br> - Yes, they did.<br> - Yeah, mine sure did.<br> Parents like stupid things.<br> Oh, I don't know about that.<br> Parents like children.<br> That's what you think.<br> I'm sure your parents loved you.<br> That's why they took you with them to Triacus.<br> So they wouldn't be so far away from you for such a long time.<br> That would make them very unhappy, and they'd miss you.<br> I'm sure that you would miss them too.<br> - Busy, busy.<br> - Busy, busy.<br> Busy, busy, busy.<br> Busy, busy, busy.<br> - Guess what we are.<br> - I know.<br> A swarm of bees.<br> Busy, busy, busy.<br> Watch out.<br> Watch out.<br> I'll sting you.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> Can we have some more ice cream, please? No, I don't think so.<br> It'll spoil your dinner.<br> See what I told you? They all say it.<br> Yeah.<br> All right, you've had a busy day.<br> You could use some rest.<br> Nurse Chapel will see you to your quarters.<br> Very good idea, captain.<br> Come on.<br> - Do we have to? - That's all right, that's enough.<br> - Tommy, just a moment.<br> - Here we go.<br> I'd like to ask you a question.<br> Come and sit down.<br> Tommy, will you tell me what you saw? Saw where? In the cave.<br> On the planet.<br> On Triacus.<br> - You were there.<br> - Did you see your father today? - I saw him.<br> - Did he seem upset? - Yeah, he was very upset.<br> - What about? Well, I didn't ask him.<br> What was going on that would have upset him? How should I know? He was always upset.<br> Just like you, Captain Kirk.<br> I'm not upset with you, Tommy, or your friends.<br> We invited you aboard the Enterprise.<br> Why would I do that if I didn't like you? You have your reasons.<br> Aren't you unhappy about leaving Triacus? That place? That's for adults.<br> Aren't you upset about leaving your parents? My parents? They love it down there.<br> Always busy.<br> They're happy.<br> Can I go now? I'm tired too, you know.<br> - Yes, certainly.<br> I'll take you.<br> - I know the way.<br> Kirk to Security.<br> Post a guard on the children.<br> They're to be kept under constant watch.<br> Hail, hail, fire and snow.<br> Call the angel, we will go.<br> Far away, for to see, friendly angel, come to me.<br> Hail, hail, fire and snow.<br> Call the angel, we will go.<br> Far away, for to see, friendly angel, come to me.<br> Hail, hail You have done very well, my friends.<br> You have done what must be done.<br> You have come aboard the Enterprise.<br> Now our destination is a Federation settlement.<br> Captain Kirk will undoubtedly choose a closer station.<br> Do not let that deter you.<br> Marcos Xll has millions of people on it.<br> Nearly a million will join us as our friends.<br> The rest will be our enemies.<br> Together with our other friends who will join us, we will defeat our enemies as we defeated them on Triacus.<br> A million friends on Marcos will make us invincible.<br> No one will tell us where to go, when to sleep, where to eat.<br> The universe will be mine to command, yours to play in.<br> To accomplish this great mission, we must first control the Enterprise.<br> To control the ship, we first must control the crew.<br> You know how to do that.<br> That is your next task.<br> And as you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.<br> As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.<br> As you believe, so shall you do, so shall you do.<br> Maintaining standard orbit, captain.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, any report from the planet's security team? Everything is quiet, sir.<br> Captain, I have extracted the salient portion - of Professor Starnes' tapes.<br> - Good.<br> Among the technical facts he gathered, Professor Starnes also offered some rather unscientific hypotheses.<br> Let's see them.<br> Log date 5025.<br>3.<br> Ever since our arrival on Triacus, I've felt a certain growing feeling of uneasiness.<br> At first I attributed it to the usual case of nerves associated with any new project.<br> However, I found that the rest of my associates are also bothered by these anxieties.<br> The only ones not affected are the children.<br> Bless them, find the whole thing an exciting adventure.<br> To be young again.<br> Let's see some more of these unscientific hypotheses, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The feeling of anxiety we've all been experiencing is growing worse.<br> There is another portion, captain, which I believe you'll find particularly interesting.<br> Professor Wilkins finished his excavation today.<br> Although whatever civilization that might have been here was destroyed by some natural catastrophe, it would appear that one of the race took refuge in the cave.<br> And for our efforts, we are becoming only more apprehensive.<br> As if some unseen force were influencing us.<br> - What happened? - Unknown.<br> I didn't see you come in, Tommy.<br> Captain, after we leave here, can you take us to Marcos Xll? No, we'll probably take you to a Federation starbase.<br> But I have relatives on Marcos Xll.<br> I'm sorry, Tommy, Marcos Xll is not within our patrol area.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we'll pursue this in my quarters.<br> Captain, can I stay here and watch? I'll be very quiet.<br> All right, Tommy.<br> Lieutenant, have Dr.<br> McCoy report to my quarters for a brief conference.<br> Mr.<br> Leslie? - Hi, there.<br> - Hi.<br> What is that? The planet Triacus.<br> Will we see that all the time we stay here? Yes, we will.<br> All the time we're here.<br> He sees Triacus on the screen.<br> He thinks he sees it.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, the screen.<br> We're out of orbit.<br> - Will we reach Marcos Xll soon? - Very soon.<br> When did we change course? We haven't changed course.<br> What do you mean, we haven't changed course? Look at your Bridge control monitor.<br> We're still in orbit, sir.<br> Have you gone completely blind? That's not orbiting position.<br> Don't touch the controls, sir.<br> What the devil do you think you doing? We must remain in this orbit till the Bridge orders a change.<br> You blind fool.<br> Can't you see what's in front of you? We're not in orbit.<br> I will not disobey an order from the Bridge.<br> You are disobeying an order from the Bridge.<br> Now step aside.<br> You're losing control of yourself, sir.<br> Not yet.<br> I'm being influenced to do things that do not make sense.<br> I even went so far as to call Starfleet Command to request a spaceship to be used as a transport.<br> It was only when I couldn't tell them what I wanted to transport that I began to realize that my mind was being directed.<br> I decided to send a dispatch to Starfleet, warning them.<br> God forgive us.<br> We must destroy ourselves.<br> Alien upon us.<br> The enemy from within.<br> The enemy! He never completed the entry.<br> And the dispatch was never sent.<br> Except for scenes of family life, games and picnics with the children, that is the complete record.<br> Whatever overwhelmed them must have done so with incredible speed.<br> Otherwise the professor would have provided details of the experience.<br> He was an excellent scientist and tireless in his pursuit of the truth.<br> - That could be what destroyed him.<br> - Possible, captain.<br> Evil does seek to maintain power by suppressing the truth.<br> Or by misleading the innocent.<br> Misleading the innocent? I wonder.<br> Do you mean the children may be involved? Yes, doctor.<br> Spock, what do we know about the race that lived here? According to the legend, Triacus was the seat of a band of marauders who made constant war throughout the system of Epsilon Indi.<br> After many centuries, the destroyers were themselves destroyed by those they had preyed upon.<br> - Is that the end of it? - No.<br> Like so many legends, this one, too, has a frightening ending.<br> It warns that the evil is awaiting a catalyst to set it again into motion and send it marauding across the galaxy.<br> Is it possible that the evil found the catalyst? I was speaking of a legend, captain.<br> But most legends have their basis in fact, Spock.<br> I think I read you, Jim.<br> But as medical officer, I must warn you that unless the normal grief is tapped and released from these children, you are treading dangerously.<br> I understand your diagnosis, doctor, and I will respect it.<br> But not to the exclusion of the safety of the Enterprise.<br> Thank you.<br> Spock, what other expeditions have visited Triacus? According to Federation records, this is the first.<br> What was it Professor Starnes said about the unseen force? He said that an unseen force was influencing him.<br> That he recognized it, was beginning to fight it, and cancelled his request for a ship.<br> A ship? Yes.<br> A ship for Triacus.<br> But why? And by whom? Security detachment, ready for relief duty on Triacus.<br> Assemble to the Transporter Room immediately.<br> I'll have some questions for that planet detachment as soon as they're beamed up.<br> I think it's about time we found out whether Professor Starnes' enemy within is on the planet below or here onboard ship with us.<br> Come on.<br> Your tour of duty will last one hour.<br> Be prepared with your communicators at all times to report any alien beings.<br> Don't wait to investigate.<br> Beam down the guards.<br> Beam up the security detachment from Triacus.<br> Spock.<br> What's wrong? I am unable to lock on to the proper coordinates, captain.<br> Why not? It appears we are no longer orbiting Triacus.<br> That's impossible.<br> If we're not orbiting Triacus, then the men I beamed down are dead.<br> Captain, we are no longer orbiting Triacus.<br> Activate the Bridge monitor screen.<br> Captain to Bridge.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, we're not orbiting Triacus.<br> With all respects, captain, you're wrong.<br> I have Triacus on my screen now.<br> You're off course.<br> I'm coming right up.<br> High, high, fire and snow Call the angel, we will go Far away, far to see Friendly angel, come to me - High, high, fire and snow - Sulu.<br> Call the angel, we will go Far away, far to see Friendly angel, come to me Friends, we have reached a moment of crisis.<br> The enemy have discovered our operation.<br> But they are too late.<br> They no longer control the ship.<br> We do.<br> We shall prevail.<br> They will take us anyplace we desire.<br> So back to your stations.<br> Maintain your controls.<br> If resistance mounts, call upon their beast.<br> Their beast will serve us well.<br> The fear in each one of them is the beast which will consume him.<br> Remember how it was on Triacus? If they resist, so shall it be on the Enterprise.<br> If you need me, call and I will appear.<br> Our new goal is Marcos Xll.<br> It is our new beginning.<br> We must not falter.<br> Go to your stations.<br> Mary, you remain here with me.<br> Helmsman, disregard what you see on the screen, what you think you see on the screen.<br> Set a course for Starbase 4.<br> - Helmsman, do you hear me? - Yes, sir.<br> Lieutenant Uhura.<br> Contact Starbase 4.<br> Tell them we're bringing the children there.<br> Tell Starfleet Command I suspect them of being alien in nature and I want a thorough investigation made upon our arrival.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Lieutenant? What are you staring at? I see my death.<br> A long death.<br> Disease and pain.<br> I see my death.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Lieutenant, there's nothing there.<br> Oh, God! Captain, don't let it be.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you make the call to Starfleet.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, I ordered you to change course.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu - Captain.<br> Stay away from the controls.<br> If you touch them, we'll be destroyed.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, there's nothing there.<br> Captain, why are we bothering Starfleet? That was an order, Spock.<br> This Bridge is under complete control.<br> - Complete.<br>.<br>? - There is no need.<br> Take a look around you.<br> I cannot obey your order, captain.<br> Take Mr.<br> Sulu to his quarters.<br> He's relieved of duty.<br> Mr.<br> Spock From the Confined to quarters Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Captain, we must get off this Bridge.<br> Yes, we must.<br> I'm losing command.<br> I'm losing my ability to command.<br> I'm losing the Enterprise.<br> I'm losing command.<br> I'm losing the Enterprise.<br> The ship is sailing on and on.<br> I'm alone.<br> Alone.<br> Alone.<br> - I'm losing command.<br> - Captain.<br> I've lost command.<br> I've lost the Enterprise.<br> Jim.<br> I've got command.<br> I've got command.<br> I've got command.<br> Correct, captain.<br> Where to, captain? Auxiliary control, my Vulcan friend.<br> This ship is off course.<br> Scotty.<br> I want you to override the Bridge navigation system - and plot a course for Starbase 4.<br> - I can't do that, sir.<br> - Why not? - These are very sensitive instruments.<br> I will not have you upset their delicate balance.<br> We would all be lost, forever lost.<br> Go away now.<br> Go away or we'll kill you.<br> Scotty.<br> Listen to me.<br> The Enterprise has been invaded by alien beings.<br> Its destination is Marcos.<br> If we take it there, millions will die the way they died at Triacus.<br> No, I'm all right, Spock.<br> My beast is finished.<br> It won't return.<br> Captain, so long as the children are present, there is danger.<br> They are the carriers.<br> Spock, they're not the alien beings.<br> They're children being misled.<br> They are followers.<br> Without followers, evil cannot spread.<br> They're children.<br> Captain, the 430 men and women onboard the Enterprise and the ship itself are endangered by these children.<br> They don't understand the evil that they're doing.<br> Perhaps that is true.<br> But the evil that is within them is spreading fast, and unless we can find a way to remove it We'll have to kill them.<br> - Captain Kirk? - What is it, now? I have been instructed to place you and Mr.<br> Spock under arrest.<br> - By whose order? - Starfleet Command, sir.<br> Where did you hear this order, ensign? Now listen to me.<br> This order is false.<br> I want you and your men to return to their stations.<br> I'm sorry, captain, but I must insist you and Mr.<br> Spock come with me to the detention section.<br> Ensign, listen to me.<br> Do not force me to kill you, sir.<br> I will if I have to.<br> - Will you come peacefully? - Ensign, listen to me.<br> This is a false order, ensign.<br> I have never disobeyed an order, captain.<br> You know I have never I know that, ensign.<br> You have never disobeyed an order.<br> - But an alien being is aboard this ship.<br> - I will not disobey now.<br> - I cannot disobey.<br> - Ensign, you will disobey this order! Starfleet Command supersedes your order, sir! Enough.<br> Take these men to detention, then join me on the Bridge.<br> The Enterprise will never reach Marcos Xll.<br> You will not be landed there.<br> The crew will take us.<br> They believe.<br> The crew does not understand.<br> When we make them understand, as I understand, they won't take you to Marcos.<br> - They will! - We are going to Marcos! - We are going to Marcos! - No, they won't.<br> - We're gonna follow our friend.<br> - They will, they will! Your friend? Where is your friend? Where is that stowaway? Why does he hide? He will come if we call him.<br> But we won't.<br> We don't need him.<br> We're not afraid of you.<br> Good.<br> I'm glad you're not afraid of me.<br> But your leader is afraid.<br> - What's he afraid of? - He's not afraid of anybody.<br> - He's not afraid of anything.<br> - He's afraid to be seen.<br> And when the crew sees and hears him, they'll understand that he is not their friend.<br> - And they won't follow him.<br> - He is our friend.<br> Then let him show himself.<br> Bring him out.<br> Let him prove to me that he is my friend and I'll follow him to Marcos Xll and to the ends of the universe.<br> No.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, play back the chant the children sang to summon up the Gorgan.<br> Hail, hail, fire and snow.<br> Call the angel, we will go.<br> Far away, for to see, friendly angel, come to me.<br> Hail, hail, fire and snow.<br> Call the angel, we will go.<br> Far away, for to see, friendly angel, come to me.<br> The time has come to see the world as it is.<br> Come on.<br> Who has summoned me? I did, Gorgan.<br> My beast is gone.<br> It lost its power in the light of reality.<br> I command again.<br> And I ordered you here.<br> No, captain.<br> I command here.<br> My followers are strong and faithful and obedient.<br> That's why we take what is ours wherever we go.<br> You take from those who do not know you.<br> And we know you.<br> - Then you know I must win, captain.<br> - Not if we join together to fight you.<br> Foolish.<br> You will be destroyed.<br> I would ask you to join me, but you are gentle.<br> And that is a grave weakness.<br> We are also very strong.<br> But your strength is cancelled by your gentleness.<br> You are full of goodness.<br> Such as you cannot be changed.<br> You are like the parents.<br> You must be eliminated.<br> Children, I have pictures of some of you on Triacus.<br> I'd like to show them to you.<br> Would you like to see them? Mr.<br> Spock, the pictures.<br> I forbid it.<br> Why should you fear it? - I fear nothing.<br> - So we were told.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the pictures.<br> The children are waiting.<br> I'll get you.<br> Come on.<br> I'll get you.<br> They would not help transport us.<br> They were against us.<br> They had to be eliminated.<br> Tommy's father would have destroyed you, but he recognized you too late.<br> You were also too late.<br> The kind ones always are.<br> Not always, Gorgan.<br> Not this time.<br> You can't hide from them.<br> They see you as we see you.<br> They know what you are.<br> - Even the children learn.<br> - You are my future generals.<br> Together we can raise armies of followers.<br> Go to your posts.<br> The first great victories are upon us.<br> You will see.<br> We have millions of friends on Marcos Xll.<br> We shall exterminate all who oppose us.<br> Our purity of purpose cannot be contaminated by those who disagree, who will not cooperate, who do not understand.<br> They must be annihilated.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> Look at him.<br> Without you children, he's nothing.<br> The evil remains within him.<br> I command you.<br> I command you.<br> To your posts.<br> Carry out your duties or I will destroy you.<br> You will be swept aside to make way for the strong.<br> How ugly he really is.<br> Look at him, and don't be afraid.<br> Death.<br> Death to you all.<br> Death to you all.<br> Death to you all.<br> Death to you all.<br> It's all right.<br> They're crying, Jim.<br> I don't know how it happened, but it's good to see.<br> It's all right, Mary.<br> It's all right.<br> It's all right, isn't it, doctor? Yes, it's all right.<br> We can help them now.<br> Marcos Xll dead ahead, sir.<br> - Reverse course, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Course reversed, captain.<br> - Set course for Starbase 4, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Yes, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain's log, stardate 5630.<br>7.<br> We have been assigned to convey the Medusan's ambassador to the Federation back to their home planet.<br> While the thoughts of the Medusans are the most sublime in the galaxy, their physical appearance is exactly the opposite.<br> They have evolved into a race of beings who are formless, so utterly hideous, that the sight of a Medusan brings total madness to any human who sees one.<br> Mr.<br> Marvick.<br> - I am James Kirk, the captain.<br> - Captain, what are you doing here? You'll have to leave before the ambassador arrives.<br> Everything will be taken care of.<br> This is Mr.<br> Spock, my first officer.<br> Yes, you're the Vulcan.<br> It's all right for you to remain, but you, Captain, and this gentleman Montgomery Scott, chief engineer.<br> Call me Scotty.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, do you have the visor? You must be sure to wear it.<br> Humans who get even a glimpse of Medusans have gone insane.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Marvick, I shall be wearing the visor.<br> We mustn't keep the ambassador waiting.<br> If you'll go with Mr.<br> Scott, the two of you will have a great deal in common.<br> Indeed.<br> It's a rare privilege meeting one of the designers of the Enterprise.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to Transporter Control Centre on the planet.<br> Aye, sir.<br> This is Captain Kirk, inform the ambassador and Dr.<br> Jones we're ready to beam them aboard.<br> Kirk out.<br> Are you sure this visor will work? It has proved effective for Vulcans.<br> It's your human half I'm worried about.<br> I shall endeavour to keep it under control.<br> Inform me when transport is complete.<br> Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos.<br> I am First Officer Spock.<br> I'm Dr.<br> Jones.<br> The ambassador is most honoured to meet you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain Kirk, we are ready.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to all decks.<br> Channel open, sir.<br> This is Captain Kirk to all ship's personnel.<br> Clearance plans now in effect.<br> Clear passageways immediately.<br> The ambassador will be escorted to his quarters at once.<br> Dr.<br> Jones, may I congratulate you on your assignment with Ambassador Kollos.<br> Thank you.<br> But the assignment's not yet definite.<br> It will depend upon my ability to achieve a true mind-link with the ambassador.<br> I'm sure you will find it a fascinating experience.<br> I wasn't aware that anyone had ever achieved a mind-link with the Medusans.<br> No one ever has.<br> I was referring to mind-links I had attempted with members of other species.<br> I've heard, Mr.<br> Spock, that you turned down the assignment with the ambassador.<br> I was unable to accept.<br> My life is here.<br> Spock to Bridge, we have arrived at the ambassador's quarters.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Notify all hands to return to stations.<br> All right, let's take her out.<br> Warp factor 2.<br> Warp factor 2, sir.<br> I would appreciate an opportunity to exchange greetings with the ambassador.<br> I'm sure the ambassador would be charmed.<br> I almost envy you your assignment.<br> I see in your mind that you are tempted to take my place.<br> Not correct, doctor.<br> Although I am aware of your mind attempting to contact mine.<br> Were you born a telepath? Yes.<br> That is why I had to study on Vulcan.<br> I understand.<br> May I show you to your quarters? I think I'll stay here a bit.<br> Ambassador Kollos often finds the process of transport somewhat unsettling.<br> I understand.<br> Our ship's surgeon often makes the same complaint.<br> Do call when you are ready.<br> What is it he sees when he looks at you? I must know.<br> I can't understand why they let you go with Kollos.<br> \"They,\" captain? The male population of the Federation.<br> Didn't someone try and talk you out of it? Now that you ask, yes.<br> Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed, otherwise I wouldn't have met you.<br> Thank you, captain.<br> Tell me, Dr.<br> Jones, why isn't it dangerous for you to be with Kollos? Spock, I can understand, nothing makes an impression on him.<br> - Why, thank you, captain.<br> - You're very welcome, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But as I understand it, no human can look at Kollos, even with a visor, without going mad.<br> How do you manage? I spent four years on Vulcan studying their mental discipline.<br> - You poor girl.<br> - On the contrary, doctor.<br> I would say that Dr.<br> Jones was indeed fortunate.<br> - Vulcan is not my idea of fun.<br> - Joy can be many things, doctor.<br> On Vulcan, I learned to do things impossible to learn anywhere else.<br> - To read minds? - How not to read them, captain.<br> I don't understand.<br> Dr.<br> Jones was born a telepath, captain.<br> Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.<br> What most humans generally find impossible to understand is the need to shut out the bedlam of other people's thoughts and emotions.<br> Or of their own thoughts and emotions.<br> I was just noticing your Vulcan IDIC, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Is it a reminder that as a Vulcan you can mind-link with the Medusans far better than I could? Well, I doubt that Mr.<br> Spock would don the most revered of all Vulcan symbols merely to annoy you, Dr.<br> Jones.<br> As a matter of fact, I wear it this evening to honour you, doctor.<br> Indeed.<br> That's very interesting, I might even say fascinating, but back to your mission.<br> Doctor, do you feel any way may be found to employ Medusan navigators on starships? It would certainly solve many of our navigational problems.<br> Well, the key is the mind-link that I learned on Vulcan.<br> Once we have learned the technique of forming a corporate intelligence with the Medusans, the designers, that's where Larry comes in, can work on adapting instruments.<br> I don't care how benevolent the Medusans are supposed to be, isn't it suicidal to deal with something ugly enough to drive men mad? Why do you do it? I see, Dr.<br> McCoy, that you still subscribe to the outmoded notion promulgated by your ancient Greeks that what is good must also be beautiful.<br> And the reverse of course, that what is beautiful is automatically expected to be good.<br> Yes, I think most of us are attracted by beauty and repelled by ugliness.<br> One of the last of our prejudices.<br> At the risk of sounding prejudiced, gentlemen, here's to beauty.<br> To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human ever to grace a starship.<br> How can one so beautiful condemn herself to look upon ugliness the rest of her life? - Will we allow it, gentlemen? - Certainly not.<br> How can one so full of joy and the love of life as you, doctor, condemn yourself to look upon disease and suffering for the rest of your life? Can we allow that, gentlemen? To whatever you want the most, Miranda.<br> Some more Antarean brandy? What is it? There's somebody nearby thinking of murder.<br> - In this room? - It's gone now.<br> Who is it? Can you tell? It isn't there anymore.<br> Captain, would you mind if I said good night? - Of course.<br> Perhaps I'll see you - Escort you to your quarters.<br> Thank you, gentlemen.<br> You make a choice impossible.<br> Please, stay and enjoy yourselves.<br> - It was a delightful dinner.<br> - Sleep well, Miranda.<br> Are you sure you're well enough to find your way alone? Of course, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Please, don't worry about me.<br> Where I come from, that's what we call a lady.<br> - Yes, she is something special.<br> - Very special.<br> I suggest you treat her accordingly.<br> I've known Dr.<br> Jones long enough to be aware of her remarkable gifts.<br> Well, it's been a long day for me.<br> Laddie, would you like to stop off at Engineering with me? I have a few things to check.<br> And a bottle of Scotch says that you can't handle the controls you designed.<br> Some other time.<br> - Good night, gentlemen.<br> - Good night, Scotty.<br> You're dressed up for the occasion, Spock, very impressive.<br> I genuinely intended to honour her, captain.<br> - Good evening, gentlemen.<br> - Good evening.<br> Sleep well.<br> Bones.<br> What's troubling you with the girl? Well, she's not just another girl, captain, don't make that mistake.<br> Oh, I didn't think that for a moment.<br> What else? I don't know what it is exactly.<br> She seems very vulnerable.<br> We're all vulnerable in one way or another.<br> Of course.<br> But there's something so very disturbing about her.<br> Meaning she's quite a woman.<br> I agree.<br> Good night, Jim.<br> Good night, Bones.<br> Miranda? - Who is it? - Larry.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> - It's late.<br> - Please, Miranda, it's important.<br> All right.<br> Come in, then.<br> I thought the dinner was never going to end.<br> I rather enjoyed it.<br> Yes, I know you did.<br> I didn't.<br> You were so far away.<br> - I'll be further away than that soon.<br> - Please don't talk of that.<br> There's so little time.<br> Please, Miranda, don't go with Kollos.<br> Now, we've been over this time and time again.<br> Don't I know.<br> I've asked you in restaurants, in the laboratory, on one knee, on both knees.<br> Miranda, how can you do this? Larry, please, try to understand.<br> I understand.<br> That you're a woman, and that I'm a man, one of your own kind.<br> And that Kollos will never be able to give you anything like this.<br> - Why did I ever meet you? - I've been honest with you.<br> I simply cannot love you the way you want me to.<br> - Miranda.<br> - And I'm going away with Kollos.<br> That's final.<br> I think you'd better leave now.<br> So it's you.<br> I didn't know that it was you before.<br> Who is it you want to kill, Larry? Is it me? You mustn't keep this to yourself.<br> I want to help you.<br> So now you want to help me? Now I know what a mere human male has to do to get a reaction out of you.<br> Make you think he's a patient.<br> A great psychologist.<br> Why don't you try being a woman for a change? Miranda.<br> Where's Mr.<br> Scott? Miranda? Miranda? Hey, there, Marvick, so you couldn't resist a wee wager? Has the ambassador been hurt? No harm has come to the ambassador, captain.<br> Who could have done such a thing? Larry Marvick.<br> Larry Marvick? Why? Do you know whether he saw the Medusan? Yes, he did.<br> Then insanity will surely be the result, captain.<br> Dangerous insanity.<br> The controls are all yours.<br> And the bottle of Scotch will be in your room this evening if you handle them.<br> Captain Kirk to all ship personnel.<br> Red alert.<br> An attempt was made to murder Kollos.<br> The murderer is dangerously insane.<br> He is Lawrence Marvick.<br> Be on the watch for him.<br> Kirk out.<br> Explain, Lieutenant Sulu? I don't believe this myself, captain, but we're travelling warp factor 8.<br>5.<br> - And accelerating.<br> - Get Engineering, Uhura.<br> They don't answer, captain.<br> Warp factor 9 and accelerating.<br> Can't you disengage power from there, Mr.<br> Spock? I'm trying, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, your assistance, please.<br> - Captain, I have Engineering now.<br> - Put them on intercom.<br> We mustn't sleep! When you're asleep, they come in your dreams! That's the worst.<br> They suffocate in your dreams.<br> - We're making it out of here.<br> - Security to Engineering.<br> - I'll go with you.<br> - No.<br> I must.<br> I can reach his mind.<br> We'll be safe on the boundaries of the universe.<br> We'll be safe! - Scotty, where are we? - I don't know.<br> Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy.<br> We made it.<br> We're safe.<br> We're safe, Captain Kirk.<br> - Bones.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> No, Captain.<br> We mustn't sleep.<br> No.<br> No.<br> No, they come in your dreams.<br> That's the worst.<br> They suffocate in your dreams.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> No.<br> - All right.<br> We'll take you to a place to hide.<br> Another place.<br> - Come on.<br> - No.<br> No.<br> We must stay here with the controls.<br> Ready to speed! Speed.<br> Speed to the next galaxy! Miranda.<br> Miranda, you're here.<br> With me.<br> Yes, Larry.<br> I'm here.<br> I didn't lose you.<br> Oh, my beautiful love, I thought I'd lost you.<br> I am here, Larry.<br> No.<br> I can see what he sees.<br> No, don't.<br> - Don't think of it.<br> - Liar.<br> Liar.<br> Deceiver.<br> You're not alone.<br> You brought it with you.<br> It's here.<br> It's here.<br> You brought it with you.<br> Liar! Liar! Liar! Don't love her! Don't love her! She'll kill you if you love her! I love you, Miranda.<br> He's dead, Jim.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5630.<br>8.<br> As a result of Larry Marvick's insane fears, the Enterprise lies derelict in uncharted space.<br> We have no way to determine our position in relation to the galaxy.<br> We are in a completely unknown void.<br> Where are we? We are evidently far outside our own galaxy, judging from the lack of traceable reference points.<br> When we exceeded warp-speed factor 9.<br>5, we apparently entered a space-time continuum.<br> I have the autopsy report on Marvick.<br> \"Heart action stop: Cause unknown.<br> Respiration stop: Cause unknown.<br> Brain activity stop: Cause\" Shall I go on? You mean he just simply died? I mean he evidently could not live with what he saw.<br> Or what he felt.<br> Damage report, Scotty.<br> We need some repairs, sir, but the ship is intact.<br> - Position report, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Impossible to calculate.<br> We lack data to analyse.<br> Our instruments appear to be functioning normally, but what they tell us makes no sense.<br> Our records are clear up to the point at which we left our galaxy.<br> Then we should be able to navigate back? Unfortunately, we lack reference points on which to plot a return course.<br> We experienced extreme sensory distortion, and we shall do so again if we attempt to use warp speed.<br> And we cannot recross the barrier using sub-light speed.<br> A madman got us into this, and it's beginning to look as if only a madman can get us out.<br> An entertaining suggestion, Mr.<br> Chekov, but not very helpful.<br> There is someone else aboard who might be able to help us navigate.<br> The Medusans have developed interstellar navigation to a fine art.<br> Could Kollos function despite the sensory distortion? Very possibly.<br> The Medusan's sensory system is radically different from ours.<br> Perhaps for the purpose of this emergency, I might become Kollos.<br> - Explain.<br> - A fusion.<br> A mind-link to create a double entity.<br> Each of us would enjoy the knowledge and sensory capabilities of both.<br> - We will function as one being.<br> - Hazards? If the link is successful, there will be a tendency to lose separate identity.<br> A necessary risk.<br> Of course, Dr.<br> Jones will not wish to give me permission to accomplish the mind-link.<br> I don't think she'll want anyone to intrude in the kind of rapport she has with Kollos.<br> Dr.<br> Jones has shown reluctance every time I've asked to converse with Kollos.<br> In some ways, she is still most human, captain.<br> Particularly in the depth of her jealousy.<br> - I could confine her to quarters.<br> - Not sufficient.<br> Her telepathic powers are formidable.<br> If it is at all possible, her mind must be so engaged that no thought of what I am doing shall intrude.<br> I think that could be arranged.<br> I may be sentimental, but this is my favourite place.<br> Earth.<br> I've never been to Earth.<br> What lovely flowers.<br> - May I touch them? - Certainly.<br> They have no scent.<br> Try these.<br> Let me see.<br> It's just a thorn.<br> I was hoping to make you forget about this today.<br> It doesn't hurt anymore.<br> You mustn't blame yourself because Marvick loved you.<br> I didn't want his love.<br> I couldn't return it.<br> Someday, you'll want human love and companionship.<br> Shall I tell you what human companionship means to me? A struggle.<br> A defence against the emotions of others.<br> At times, the emotions burst in on me.<br> Hatred, desire, envy, pity.<br> Pity is the worst of all.<br> I agree with the Vulcans.<br> Violent emotion is a kind of insanity.<br> You're willing to spend the rest of your life with the Medusans in order to avoid human emotion? Perhaps.<br> A meeting of minds is all very well, but what about love, Miranda? You're young, attractive, and human.<br> Sooner or later, no matter how beautiful their minds are, you're going to yearn for someone who looks like yourself.<br> Someone who isn't ugly.<br> Ugly? What is ugly? Who is to say whether Kollos is too ugly to bear? Or too beautiful to bear? Miranda, I meant no insult.<br> Please.<br> Here we are among the roses.<br> A very romantic setting.<br> I wish there were moonlight too.<br> Moonlight would suit you very well.<br> I see you're a very complicated man.<br> - Kollos, no, you mustn't let him do it.<br> - Miranda.<br> Miranda, don't.<br> - Let me go.<br> - Miranda.<br> No.<br> You have no idea of what a dangerous thing Spock is planning.<br> We must stop him.<br> Let me go! The Enterprise is at stake.<br> It is not possible for you to be involved.<br> Why? I've already committed myself to mind-link when Kollos and I reach the Medusan vessel.<br> Why put yourself in jeopardy? This is not a duty that you can assume.<br> I'm aware of the fact that your telepathic competence might be superior to mine, but there is a more important factor.<br> The object is to pilot this ship.<br> That is something you cannot do.<br> Then teach me to operate the ship.<br> I can memorize instantly.<br> Now, wait a minute.<br> I realise you can do almost anything a sighted person can, but you can't pilot a starship.<br> What? Fascinating.<br> I'm sorry, Miranda, but you must be realistic.<br> You are blind.<br> And there are some things you simply cannot do.<br> Evidently, a highly sophisticated sensor web.<br> My compliments to you and to your dressmaker.<br> Yes, of course.<br> It's the only reasonable explanation.<br> You can't see, and Kollos can't hurt you.<br> An elegant solution.<br> But I fail to understand why you apparently tried to conceal your blindness, Dr.<br> Jones.<br> I think I understand.<br> You said that pity is the worst of all.<br> Pity.<br> Which I hate.<br> Do you think you can gather more information with your eyes than I can with my sensors? I could play tennis with you, Captain Kirk.<br> I might even beat you.<br> I am standing exactly one meter, four centimetres, from the door.<br> Can you judge distance that accurately? I can even tell you how fast your heart is beating.<br> Oh, that won't be necessary.<br> Mr.<br> Spock will make the mind-link.<br> No other decision is possible.<br> No.<br> I won't let you.<br> Please.<br> Do not fight us like this, Dr.<br> Jones.<br> I appeal to you as a colleague.<br> Do not oppose us.<br> No.<br> If we can't persuade you, there is someone who can.<br> You'll have to take this up with Kollos.<br> For your own sake.<br> Bones, why hadn't you told me? She would have told you herself if she'd wanted you to know.<br> I respect her privacy.<br> Yes, there's a great deal to respect about that lady.<br> It seems I have no choice but to obey you.<br> Captain's log, supplementary.<br> Our one chance to return to our own galaxy is dependant upon the navigational skills of the Medusan ambassador.<br> Without him in view, Kollos has been brought to the Bridge and placed behind a protective shield.<br> This is delightful.<br> I know you.<br> All of you.<br> James Kirk, captain and friend for many years.<br> And Leonard McCoy, also of long acquaintance.<br> And Uhura, whose name means freedom.<br> \"She walks in beauty, like the night.<br>\" That's not Spock.<br> Are you surprised to find that I've read Byron, doctor? That's Spock.<br> Am I addressing the ambassador? In part.<br> That is, part of us is known to you as Kollos.<br> Miranda.<br> There you are.<br> Oh, brave new world that has such creatures in it.<br> 'Tis new to thee.<br> My world is next for us.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> I speak for all of us you call Medusans.<br> I am sorry for the trouble I've brought to your ship.<br> We don't hold you to blame for what happened, and thank you now for your help.<br> And now to the business at hand.<br> With your permission, captain.<br> Yes.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, release the helm to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Coordination is completed.<br> Then go ahead, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Warp 1 in six seconds.<br> Five, four, three, two, one, zero.<br> Position report, please, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Our position? Our position is so close to the point where we entered the void, the difference isn't worth mentioning.<br> - Bull's-eye, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Thank you, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Manoeuvre completed, captain.<br> - Take over, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Thank you, ambassador.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, plot a new course.<br> New headings will be plotted in a minute, sir.<br> How compact your bodies are.<br> What a variety of senses you have.<br> This thing you call language, though.<br> Most remarkable.<br> You depend on it for so very much.<br> But is any one of you really its master? But most of all, the aloneness.<br> You are so alone.<br> You live out your lives in this shell of flesh.<br> Self-contained, separate.<br> How lonely you are.<br> How terribly lonely.<br> Ambassador.<br> You must dissolve the link.<br> So soon? There must be no delay.<br> You're a wise captain.<br> Captain.<br> Spock! Don't look! Cover your eyes! - Don't move.<br> - Jim.<br> No one is to move.<br> Spock, are you all right? Spock? It's all right.<br> You're safe with us now.<br> He's hardly breathing.<br> Help me get him to Sickbay.<br> Unless Miranda can look down into his mind and turn it outward to us, we'll lose Spock.<br> Vulcan mind techniques, they seem so untrustworthy - now that Spock's life is at stake.<br> - Her knowledge of it may be the only thing that could save Spock's sanity, perhaps even his own life.<br> But does she want to? - She's been in there so long.<br> - There's nothing else to be done.<br> She tried to help Marvick, and Marvick is dead.<br> That's different.<br> Marvick loved her.<br> And Spock is her rival.<br> Is that any better? Even Spock felt the violence of her jealousy.<br> But they weren't rivals in love.<br> Jim.<br> You shouldn't go in there.<br> Whatever happens, Bones, don't interfere.<br> Who is it? Dr.<br> McCoy? Who's there? Captain Kirk.<br> I have no news for you, captain.<br> No change? Only that his life processes are ebbing.<br> - What are you doing about it? - Well, what I can, of course.<br> Which doesn't seem to be much.<br> No doubt you think I can wake him with a kiss? It's worth a try, isn't it? After all, he's not a machine.<br> But he is a Vulcan.<br> Only half, the other half is human.<br> Far more human than you, apparently.<br> Face reality, captain.<br> His mind has gone down almost too far even for me to reach.<br> If you don't reach him soon, he'll die.<br> - But that's what you want, isn't it? - That's a lie.<br> Oh, yes, it is.<br> You want him to die.<br> What did you do to him on the Bridge? Make him forget to put the visor over his eyes? - You're insane.<br> - Yes, you know your rival, don't you? You couldn't keep him from making a mind-link with Kollos, something that you couldn't do yourself.<br> With my words, I'll make you hear such ugliness.<br> What Spock saw when he looked at Kollos with his naked eyes.<br> - The ugliness is within you.<br> - That's a lie! Liar! Your passion to see Kollos is madness.<br> You can never see, never.<br> But Spock saw Kollos.<br> - And for that, he must die.<br> - Sadistic, filthy liar! The smell of hatred, the stench of jealousy permeates you.<br> Why don't you strangle him while he lies there? - Don't say anymore, please! - Kollos knows what's in your heart.<br> You can lie to yourself, but you can't lie to Kollos.<br> Please, go away.<br> - What did you say to her? - Maybe too much.<br> What's she doing in there? You may be right, Bones, maybe I shouldn't have gone in.<br> She was blind, really blind, really in the dark.<br> And if he dies If he dies, how do I know that I didn't kill him? How do I know that she can stand to hear the truth? Now, Spock, this is to the death.<br> Or to life for both of us.<br> Spock.<br> You look like you've paid a visit to the devil himself.<br> Miranda.<br> - You have what you wanted most? - I am one with Kollos.<br> Well, I'm truly sorry that you're leaving.<br> Goodbye.<br> We've come to the end of an eventful trip, captain.<br> I didn't think you'd even talk to me.<br> I have you to thank for my future.<br> Your words enabled me to see.<br> Miranda, good luck, health.<br> I have something for you.<br> I suppose it has thorns.<br> I never met a rose that didn't.<br> I know now the great joy you felt when you joined minds with Kollos.<br> I rejoice in your knowledge and in your achievement.<br> I understand, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The glory of creation is in its infinite diversity.<br> And the ways our differences combine to create meaning and beauty.<br> Peace and long life, Spock.<br> Live long and prosper, Miranda.<br> Peace.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

We're talking like we really are in Tombstone, Arizona in 1881.<br> Precisely, in terms of what the Melkots intend for us.<br> There's something about that date.<br> October 26th, 1881.<br> But what was it?

Funny.<br> That's what I like about you, lke.<br> - You always see the funny side.<br> - Yes, I'm a barrel of laughs.<br> Well, nobody can say Johnny Behan doesn't have a sense of humour.<br> Johnny? He called me lke, you Frank, Bones Tom.<br> And Billy.<br> Ike Clanton, Tom and Frank McLaury, Billy Claiborne, Billy Clanton.<br> Captain, I pride myself on my knowledge of your Earth history.<br> The names were known in the annals of the opening of the western sector of America.<br> The United States of America, that is.<br> In the late 19th century in Arizona, two factions fought for control of the town of Tombstone.<br> The Earps: Morgan, Virgil and Wyatt, who were the town marshals, along with Doc Holliday.<br> And the Clanton gang.<br> On October 26th, they had it out.<br> Who won? The Clantons lost, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> And we are the Clantons.<br> We are the Clantons.<br> And if this is a replay of history History cannot be changed.<br> It's impossible.<br> Things like this can't happen.<br> Is this a dead man, doctor? Very dead, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That's one thing we can be sure of here.<br> Death is real.<br> Ike, Frank.<br> How are you, boys? I didn't think I'd see you again.<br> Billy.<br> Oh, Billy.<br> Billy, baby, I knew they couldn't keep you out of town.<br> - Oh, you knew that? - Come on.<br> Maybe you shouldn't have.<br> And pass up an opportunity to see you? Don't be silly.<br> It's taking crazy chances with Morgan Earp right in the same room.<br> Yes, of course.<br> The man who kills on sight.<br> Morgan Earp.<br> Captain, since we have seen that death is the one reality in this situation, I seriously suggest you reseat yourself immediately.<br> Without moving a muscle of either hand.<br> If I remember correctly, that would involve you in what was called the fast draw.<br> It initiated unfortunate events.<br> You boys want your usual? Absolutely, a half a gallon of Scotch.<br> You know we ain't got nothing but bourbon.<br> Unless you want corn whisky.<br> I wish it was all over.<br> Ike, I saw Virgil out patrolling this morning.<br> Good old Virgil.<br> We can always count on him.<br> They've been blowing off all over town how they chased the Clantons out.<br> I guess you'll show them now, won't you? I don't think we're gonna have any choice.<br> You'll dirty yourself with this scum.<br> Come on.<br> - Get your hands off her.<br> - Now, Claiborne Now, now, all right, all right, all right.<br> Now, we don't want any trouble.<br> If you don't want trouble, what are you doing in my town? Just leave us alone, Mr.<br> Earp.<br> That's all we ask.<br> Five of you.<br> You'd like me to draw, wouldn't you? All right, I will.<br> Soon enough.<br> Soon enough.<br> I believe he was actually trying to provoke a dispute with Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Close, lke.<br> Lucky there wasn't two of them.<br> I guess so.<br> Sylvia's right.<br> They've been badmouthing something fierce all over town.<br> - You boys watch it.<br> - I assure you, sir, we shall watch it.<br> And everything, extremely closely.<br> Billy, you were wonderful.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> What can I do, captain? You know we're always supposed to maintain good relations with the natives.<br> Young lady.<br> - Young lady.<br> - Yes, lke? I'd like to talk to Mr To Billy alone if you don't mind.<br> All right.<br> I understand.<br> Billy Claiborne, you be careful.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, you be careful.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, except for our handguns, we haven't changed.<br> Not even our clothing, yet these people see and hear us as the Clantons.<br> I don't think that's such a bad thing, captain.<br> - The day is still young, ensign.<br> - All right, what have we got? We're here in Tombstone, Arizona, October 26th, 1881.<br> The day of the gunfight at O.<br>K.<br> Corral.<br> And we're the Clantons.<br> And Morgan Earp has just gone off to tell his brothers that we're here.<br> And if this is indeed some sort of a replay of history, the Earps will kill the Clantons at the O.<br>K.<br> Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.<br> Well, we're not going to be at the O.<br>K.<br> Corral at 5:00 this afternoon.<br> You, bartender, Ed.<br> You claim you know us.<br> I ain't making no big claims about nobody.<br> Just so happens.<br> Take a close look at me.<br> - Yeah? - Who do you think I am? Lke Clanton.<br> Who do you think you are? Well, I know this is hard to understand, but I'm Captain James T.<br> Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise.<br> These men are part of my crew.<br> We're not really here.<br> We're from the future.<br> We haven't been born yet.<br> Feel the material in my shirt.<br> Now feel the material in your own shirt.<br> Do you notice any difference? Nope.<br> - Do these clothes look like yours? - Not exactly.<br> Have you ever seen clothes like this before? - Sure.<br> - Where? On the Clantons.<br> You Clantons are always great with your jokes.<br> That's why we like you.<br> I'm not joking.<br> Only difference between you and the Earps is that they never joke.<br> I'm not joking.<br> I'm not lke Clanton.<br> It's okay with me, lke.<br> Anything you say.<br> Don't make no difference who I think you are.<br> Your problem is, who does Wyatt Earp think you are? Good morning, gentlemen.<br> My name is James Kirk, and I'm afraid there's been some sort of misunderstanding.<br> Clanton, I don't know what you're trying to pull, but we warned you not to show your ugly face in town again.<br> Of course, and I wanted to talk about that.<br> We're done talking, Clanton.<br> There's been some sort of mistake, a misunderstanding.<br> L All right, Clanton.<br> One more chance, your last.<br> You've got until 5 tonight to get your horse-stealing, scurvy crew out of town.<br> All the way.<br> Yes, we'd be glad to.<br> We don't want to fight.<br> I always said you was yellow.<br> I'll make one more attempt to get through to you, Mr.<br> Earp.<br> My name is not Clanton.<br> It's Kirk.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> We heard the talk about your jokes.<br> I'm not joking.<br> Sure.<br> Well, I'm glad to meet you, Mr.<br> Kirk.<br> - Draw, Clanton.<br> - Not me, Mr.<br> Earp.<br> - You draw or I will.<br> - No, Wyatt.<br> Let me.<br> When the time comes, I'll pay him for this.<br> We don't want any trouble.<br> We'd be glad to cooperate.<br> Five o'clock, Clanton.<br> Is that clear? If you're in town at 5:01, we'll kill every one of you whether you draw or not.<br> Is that clear? - What's the matter? - What do you call that stuff, fire? \"Taos Lightning straight bourbon.<br>\" Try some.<br> In small amounts, it was considered medicinal.<br> They ought to label it \"For external use only.<br>\" It just takes a bit of getting used to, captain.<br> Actually, a man could grow quite fond of this stuff.<br> Take it easy, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I hate to think what that's doing to your stomach.<br> And your reflexes.<br> We're gonna need fast reflexes from now on.<br> There's no negotiating with the Earps.<br> We know that.<br> Aye.<br> If we only had a phaser.<br> Or a communicator.<br> It'd be a pleasure to watch those Earps as we beamed back to the ship at exactly 4:59:30.<br> - Could we make a communicator? - Impossible, captain.<br> In this century, there are no metal alloys or power sources to make devices such as ours.<br> Problem is clear, Spock.<br> We're gonna have to seek contemporary solutions.<br> - Where's Chekov? - Mr.<br> Chekov is involved, captain.<br> You shouldn't have come back to town, Billy.<br> Morgan will kill you because he wants me.<br> With his outdated weapon? If he shoots at me, I will just step out of the way.<br> You can joke about it.<br> I've seen him in action.<br> Especially Morgan.<br> A lot of people and things have tried to kill me.<br> You'd be surprised.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov I mean, Billy.<br> Come along.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Billy.<br> Please, don't even go near him.<br> Gentlemen.<br> - Where are we going, captain? - To exercise the better part of valour.<br> Well, that settles that.<br> A force field.<br> It is obvious the Melkotians are not going to permit us to leave this town.<br> If we could only contact the Enterprise.<br> Yes, but where is the Enterprise? Mr.<br> Chekov, if you were in charge of the Enterprise, what would you be doing? I'd be using the ship's sensors, trying to locate us.<br> Very good.<br> If we could find the place where we beamed down, the ship might lock in and beam us up.<br> - Well, let's get there.<br> - There's no way we can know where it is, doctor.<br> It could be anywhere within a thousand-mile radius.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, why don't you join us common humanoids in trying to find a way out of here and quit explaining why we can't get out.<br> We have until 5:00 to find that way.<br> Now, consider this.<br> What materials were on hand in 1881 that could help us fight the Earps on their own terms? - We have these, captain.<br> - No, the Melkots gave us those to execute us.<br> We have to find a way to put the Earps out of action.<br> Is there anything that exists here and now that could help us out of this trap? All those Western Cossacks had were poisonous snakes and cactus plants.<br> Bones, the venom, the plants.<br> Can you make use of them? A tranquilliser.<br> Of course, Jim, I can make a tranquilliser.<br> I could make a device to deliver it on target.<br> First, Bones, the ingredients you require.<br> I know the place to get the proper drugs.<br> - I'll need a mortar and a pestle.<br> - Chekov, mortar and pestle.<br> How do you intend to deliver the tranquilliser on target? I shall need some fusing and some cotton wadding.<br> - Cotton wadding, try the apothecary.<br> - Aye.<br> I shall manufacture the equivalent of an ancient generating canister, more familiarly known as a gas grenade.<br> I'll be about five minutes yet.<br> You could come back.<br> Well, thank you.<br> Mind if I look around a bit? Crude, but very useable.<br> I wouldn't touch that stuff if I was you.<br> Oh, you don't have to worry.<br> I know how to handle this.<br> I have an urgent need for a small supply of this drug too.<br> That stuff ain't mine.<br> It belongs to him.<br> You'd better ask him.<br> Oh, so you're the dentist? Well, I'm a physician, and I have a serious emergency.<br> I wonder if you mind if I'd borrow a small quantity of this.<br> - You want it now? - My name is McCoy.<br> I'm a doctor.<br> That joke is all around town already, McLaury.<br> Well, my name is still Holliday.<br> Doc Holliday.<br> The emergency is real.<br> I need these things.<br> Your emergency sure is real.<br> Go on, take the stuff.<br> Have some more fun.<br> Take my bag.<br> Only best you be finished before 5:00.<br> That is my intention, doctor.<br> Because at one minute past 5, you'll find a hole in your head.<br> Right from this gun.<br> Sylvia.<br> Hello.<br> Billy Claiborne, do you know how crazy I am about you? That's very nice.<br> Well, aren't you gonna ask me what I've got in my shopping bag? That's just what I was preparing to enquire.<br> Have you been shopping? Of course, silly.<br> What else would I be doing on a beautiful afternoon with the dance only one week away? - Or have you forgotten that already? - No, no, I haven't forgotten.<br> I am looking forward to it most eagerly.<br> You will be absolutely wild when you see me in the new gown I'm going to make.<br> I found this most scrumptious material.<br> Yards and yards of it.<br> You know what I was thinking, Billy? I was thinking what a beautiful wedding gown it would make.<br> Why don't we just turn that dance into a wedding ball? It would be so heavenly.<br> Married? I am afraid that wouldn't be possible.<br> But I'm positive the gown will be ready.<br> And what else is there to stop a wedding? But it is absolutely impossible.<br> I am not someone you can marry.<br> If only I could make clear to you what I really am.<br> Do you think I don't know? Billy Claiborne, you are a cattle rustler and a horse thief.<br> And I don't care what else.<br> I warned you, Claiborne.<br> Stay away.<br> You don't have to take anything from that scum.<br> Not while I'm here.<br> Mr.<br> Earp.<br> Get your hands off her.<br> There's nothing I can do, Jim.<br> Come on, Clanton.<br> Let's do it now.<br> - Captain, let me.<br> - No.<br> Yeah, come on, captain.<br> Let him.<br> Captain, we can't just stand here and take it.<br> - Yes, we can.<br> - But they murdered Chekov.<br> - If you think I'm going to - Scotty.<br> They're trying to push us into something we're not ready for.<br> And it is not yet our time.<br> Let it go, Jim.<br> He's dead.<br> Maybe he wouldn't be if I hadn't ignored the Melkot warning.<br> We all knew the risk when we joined the service.<br> Now, let it go.<br> Gentlemen, there is one thing which requires the immediate attention of all of us.<br> Specifically, our future.<br> But not this minute, Spock.<br> It takes us a little longer.<br> I understand the feeling, captain.<br> You talk about another man's feelings.<br> What do you feel, Spock? My feelings are not subject for discussion, doctor.<br> Because there are no feelings to discuss.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, Chekov is dead.<br> I say it now, and I can hardly believe it.<br> But you worked closely with him.<br> That deserves some memorial.<br> Spock will have no truck with grief, Scotty.<br> It's human.<br> - Bones, Scotty.<br> - Captain, it's quite all right.<br> They forget I am half human.<br> We don't have much time.<br> Captain, I vaguely remember the historical account of the famous battle in which we are about to engage, but I am confused.<br> About what? Since each of us represents members of the Clanton gang You, lke Clanton, I, Frank McLaury.<br> - Then Mr.<br> Chekov would be the other Billy, would he not? William Claiborne, that's right.<br> But did not William Claiborne survive the battle at the O.<br>K.<br> Corral? Get to the point, Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov is dead, but in the actual gunfight, William Claiborne survived.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, that's right.<br> That means it doesn't have to happen the way it happened.<br> We can change it.<br> Bones, how's the tranquilliser coming? - I'll have it ready before Spock.<br> - Spock? Another hour.<br> And we'll have a tranquilliser grenade? - Not precisely.<br> - Forget precision.<br> Will it work? It should.<br> Make sure it does, Spock.<br> If we don't tranquillise them, we'll have to fight them.<br> And if we fight them, we all die.<br> We know that.<br> Negotiating with them could buy us more time, captain.<br> But not with the Earps.<br> I've tried that.<br> That's out.<br> There must be a way.<br> History has been changed in the fact that Billy Claiborne didn't die, but Chekov is lying there dead.<br> That means there must be a way to change this time in history.<br> It would be worth a try, at least until we're certain of the device.<br> Then perhaps we could quiet things down.<br> Not with the Earps.<br> There is one other place I can try.<br> You looking for somebody? Yes, sheriff.<br> - I want you to stop the fight.<br> - Stop it? Who wants to stop it? I sure don't.<br> You don't.<br> - You didn't yesterday.<br> - I do now.<br> Since when does a Clanton run crawling to the law for help? - How else is he gonna get justice? - From this.<br> You and your boys set up this whole thing to take care of the Earps.<br> It's a little late to decide you don't have the belly for it.<br> It's not too late.<br> Sheriff.<br> Sheriff.<br> There must be decent people in town who don't like the Earps.<br> - Let's organise them.<br> - Don't talk nonsense.<br> The people in this town are counting on you to get rid of the Earps for them.<br> Then the people better wake up and let the law work for them.<br> You can talk that way after what the Earps did to Billy today? Nobody in this town will deny you your right to your revenge.<br> Yes, I want revenge.<br> I want to crush the life out of the Earps.<br> - But I can't just kill them.<br> - You listen to me.<br> Get down to the O.<br>K.<br> Corral, keep out of sight.<br> When the Earps come looking, you bushwhack them.<br> Can't I get it through your head? I can't just kill them.<br> - I can't just kill them! - It's the only way! - I can't murder them! I can't kill them! - Kill them any way you can! There'll be no questions asked.<br> Honest.<br> I guarantee that.<br> These crude supplies we were forced to use worked quite well.<br> I doubt that this combination of things was ever used for any purpose quite like this.<br> Perhaps they would have been if they'd had your ingenuity, doctor.<br> Captain? - How soon will that be ready? - Right now.<br> Good.<br> How long will it take the tranquilliser to have effect? - Three or four seconds.<br> - How did you manage to test it? It has not been tested.<br> It's not necessary, captain.<br> It's very simple.<br> Nothing can go wrong.<br> Up to now, everything has gone wrong.<br> I want it tested now.<br> Would a volunteer solve the problem? - It would.<br> - All right.<br> On one condition.<br> That I'm wide awake and with you at 5:00.<br> - Guaranteed.<br> - All right.<br> It's to kill the pain.<br> But this is painless.<br> Well, you should have warned me sooner, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Fire away.<br> It should have worked.<br> Did you inhale the gas, Scotty? Aye, deeply.<br> - You still feel all right? - Never felt better.<br> No dizziness, no sweating, no palpitations? It doesn't work.<br> Indeed, fascinating.<br> It was our last chance.<br> Captain, you don't seem to understand.<br> It did not function, but it must function.<br> Nothing could go wrong, captain.<br> It should work.<br> A scientific fact.<br> But if the tranquilliser does not function, which is clearly impossible, then a radical alteration of our thought patterns must be in order.<br> We need a weapon.<br> An answer.<br> Don't have to worry about that now, Jim.<br> Look at the clock.<br> Ten minutes.<br> And it's all gonna end at the O.<br>K.<br> Corral.<br> Well, we're gonna wait right here until well after 5:00.<br> We're not gonna move from this spot.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Scotty, Bones.<br> We're trapped.<br> They got their way.<br> We better stand and fight.<br> Good.<br> If they want a fight, let's give them a fight.<br> They're experts at gunfighting.<br> We won't have a chance.<br> Well, then we'd better become experts, and fast.<br> That may not be necessary.<br> - Spock, you've got something? - A fact, captain.<br> Physical laws simply cannot be ignored.<br> Existence cannot be without them.<br> What do you mean, Spock? I mean, doctor, that we are faced with a staggering contradiction.<br> The tranquilliser you created should have been effective.<br> It would have been effective anywhere else.<br> Exactly.<br> Doctor, in your opinion, what killed Mr.<br> Chekov? A piece of lead in his body.<br> Wrong.<br> His mind killed him.<br> Well, come on, Spock.<br> If you've got the answer, tell us.<br> Physical reality is consistent with universal laws.<br> Where the laws do not operate, there is no reality.<br> All of this is unreal.<br> What do you mean, unreal? I examined Chekov.<br> He's dead.<br> But you made your examination under conditions which we cannot trust.<br> We judge reality by the response of our senses.<br> Once we are convinced of the reality of a given situation, we abide by its rules.<br> We judge the bullets to be solid, the guns to be real.<br> Therefore, they can kill.<br> Chekov is dead because he believed the bullets would kill him.<br> He may indeed be dead.<br> We do not know.<br> But we do know that the Melkotians created the situation.<br> If we do not allow ourselves to believe that the bullets are real, they cannot kill us.<br> Exactly.<br> I know the bullets are unreal, therefore they cannot harm me.<br> We must all be as certain as you are, Mr.<br> Spock, - if we're to save our lives.<br> - Precisely.<br> But that's not possible.<br> There'd always be some doubt.<br> The smallest doubt would be enough to kill you.<br> We're just human beings, Spock.<br> We don't have that clockwork ticker in our heads like you do.<br> - We can't just turn it on and off.<br> - We must.<br> Spock, a Vulcan mind-meld.<br> Very well, sir.<br> Engineer? Your mind to my mind.<br> Your thoughts to my thoughts.<br> The bullets are unreal.<br> Without body.<br> They are illusions only.<br> Shadows without substance.<br> They will not pass through your body, for they do not exist.<br> They do not exist.<br> Unreal.<br> Appearances only.<br> They are shadows, illusions.<br> Nothing but ghosts of reality.<br> They are lies, falsehoods.<br> Specters without body.<br> They are to be ignored.<br> Captain.<br> Draw.<br> Captain, I don't understand.<br> Neither do I.<br> He's in perfect health.<br> What happened? Where have I been? Right here, it seems.<br> But that girl, she was so beautiful.<br> So real.<br> Do you remember anything else? - No.<br> - Good.<br> Perhaps that explains why he's here.<br> Nothing was real to him except the girl.<br> Captain, the Melkotian object.<br> Sensor readings.<br> The object is beginning to emit M-rays of a highly unstable nature, captain.<br> Lieutenant, sound red alert.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, deflector shields on full.<br> - Deflectors on full, sir.<br> - Gun crews, lock on target.<br> Energy output increasing beyond measurable levels, captain.<br> Phaser guns, stand by to fire.<br> It's gone, sir.<br> Damage report, lieutenant.<br> No damage, sir.<br> All decks report fully operational.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> You did not kill.<br> - Is this the way of your kind? - It is.<br> We fight only when there's no choice.<br> We prefer the ways of peaceful contact.<br> I speak for a vast alliance of fellow creatures who believe in the same thing.<br> We have sought you out to join us.<br> Our mission is still one of peace.<br> Approach our planet and be welcome.<br> A delegation will come out to meet you.<br> Our warning threats are over.<br> Excellent.<br> Lieutenant, cancel red alert.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, resume original course, warp factor 2.<br> Warp factor 2, sir.<br> Captain, may I ask a question? You needn't answer if it seems too personal.<br> I'm sure I'll be able to give you an answer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> This afternoon, you wanted to kill, didn't you? But he didn't kill, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But he wanted to, doctor.<br> Is that the way it seemed to you, Mr.<br> Spock? Yes, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you're absolutely right.<br> That's exactly the way it was.<br> Mankind, ready to kill.<br> That's the way it was in 1881.<br> I wonder how humanity managed to survive.<br> We overcame our instinct for violence.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

No, sir.<br> She's a projectile, at warp 9.<br> And don't ask me what's holding her together.<br> Five-minute reports, Scotty.<br> Kirk out.<br> Full sensor scan of the ship.<br> Report on any movement by the Klingons.<br> The Klingon Empire has maintained a duelling tradition, I think they can beat us with swords.<br> Neither the Klingon technology, nor ours, is capable of this.<br> The instantaneous transmutation of matter.<br> I doubt they are responsible.<br> Any other logical candidate? None.<br> However, if they had such power, would they not have used it to create more effective weapons? And only for themselves? Mr.<br> Sulu, get below.<br> Take command of Engineering - and Auxiliary Control.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Captain.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov? - Captain.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov, as you were.<br> - Chekov! - Sir.<br> Let me go too.<br> I've got a personal score to settle with the Klingons.<br> This is no time for a vendetta.<br> Maintain your post.<br> - Captain.<br> - Chekov, maintain your post.<br> Don't try to stop me, captain.<br> I saw what they left of Piotr.<br> I swore on his grave I would avenge his murder.<br> What's Chekov's grudge against the Klingons? Who's Piotr? His only brother, killed in a Klingon raid.<br> His brother? He never had a brother.<br> He's an only child.<br> - Sulu, get down to Engineering.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Security, this is the captain.<br> Find Mr.<br> Chekov and bring him to the Bridge.<br> Captain, why would.<br>.<br>? Why would Chekov believe he has a brother? I don't know.<br> But he does.<br> And now he wants revenge for a non-existent loss.<br> There.<br> Those filthy butchers.<br> There are rules, even in war.<br> You don't keep hacking at a man after he's down.<br> Hand me that numanol capsule.<br> Layout and specifications of the Enterprise, commander.<br> Enemy numbers are the same as ours.<br> - We have a fighting balance.<br> - Then we take this ship.<br> This ship that is headed towards the end of the galaxy? In time.<br> In time.<br> We must take these sections.<br> First, Engineering.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> There's no use trying to free those men down below.<br> The phaser torches, they won't cut through the bulkheads, nor the doors, nor the decks.<br> Something happened to the metal.<br> - What about the armoury? - Well, I'm there now, sir.<br> And you never saw such a fine collection of antiques in your life.<br> Get back to Engineering, try and re-establish engine control.<br> And talk to Ordnance about manufacturing phaser replacements.<br> Aye, sir.<br> A claymore.<br> You're a beauty.<br> What the blazes is going on? Scans indicate that our forces and those of the Klingons are exactly equal at 38 each.<br> The Klingons control Deck 6 and Starboard Deck 7 while we control all sections above.<br> Constant surveillance, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Most curious, captain.<br> - What? There appear to be more life energy units on board than can be accounted for by the presence of the Enterprise crew plus the Klingons.<br> A considerable discrepancy.<br> Could more Klingons have beamed aboard? I shall attempt a compensatory reading of Klingon units.<br> Any signs of those devils, Mr.<br> Sulu? All clear, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> They've taken Engineering.<br> I don't know how many more Klingons are around, but we'll split up and try to make it back to the Bridge.<br> Aye.<br> Victory! Victory! No additional Klingons detected, captain.<br> It is an alien life force, a single entity.<br> I cannot ascertain its location.<br> An alien life force.<br> We must make contact, find out what it wants.<br> Readings being diverted to the library computer for analysis.<br> Computer report.<br> Alien life force onboard is composed of pure energy, type unknown.<br> Actions indicate intelligence and purpose.<br> What purpose? Insufficient data for further analysis.<br> A brother that never existed, a phantom colony, imaginary distress calls, the creation of these weapons.<br> Do you sense a pattern, Mr.<br> Spock? If the alien is creating these events, captain, it is apparently capable of manipulating matter and mind.<br> And now it has control of the Enterprise, and taking us out of the galaxy.<br> - But why? - I am constrained to point out, that since minds are evidently being influenced, we cannot know at this moment whether our own memories are completely accurate and true.<br> We must talk to Kang.<br> Bury the hatchet.<br> An appropriate choice of terms, captain.<br> However, it is notoriously difficult to arrange a truce with the Klingons once blood has been drawn.<br> A truce? Are you serious? I've got men in Sickbay, some of them dying, atrocities committed on their persons.<br> And you talk about making peace with these fiends? Why, if our backs were turned they'd jump us in a minute.<br> And you know what Klingons do to prisoners.<br> Slave labour, death planets, experiments.<br> - McCoy? - While you're talking, they're planning attacks.<br> This is a fight to the death.<br> We'd better start trying to win it.<br> We are attempting to end it, doctor.<br> By reason, preferably.<br> There is an alien onboard which may have created the situation.<br> Who cares what started it, Mr.<br> Spock? We're in it.<br> Those murderers.<br> We should wipe out every one of them.<br> The alien is the real threat, that's the enemy we have to wipe out.<br> Sickbay calling, doctor.<br> There are more wounded men requiring your attention.<br> How many more men must die before you two begin to act like military men instead of fools? Kirk here.<br> This is Kang.<br> Kang, there's something important I must discuss with you.<br> I have captured your Engineering section.<br> I now control the ship's power and life-support systems.<br> I have deprived all areas except our own.<br> You will die of suffocation in the icy cold of space.<br> The Enterprise is heading out of our galaxy, controlled by a mysterious alien somewhere aboard the ship.<br> Engineering has been taken over by Klingons who have cut off life-support systems.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Captain.<br> Get to Emergency Manual Control.<br> Try to protect our life-support circuits and auxiliary power.<br> Aye, captain.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Chekov was right, captain.<br> Scotty, I'm glad they We should have left those fuzz-faced goons in the transporter.<br> - That's right where they belong.<br> - Scotty? Non-existence.<br> Now they can study the Enterprise, add our technology to theirs, change the balance of power.<br> - You've jeopardised the Federation.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Listen, Scott.<br> - Keep your Vulcan hands off me.<br> Just keep away.<br> Your feelings might be hurt, you green-blooded half-breed.<br> May I say that I have not thoroughly enjoyed serving with humans? I find their illogic and foolish emotions a constant irritant.<br> Then transfer out, freak.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Spock.<br> Scotty.<br> Spock.<br> Spock! Stop it, you half-human.<br> What are we saying? What are we doing to each other? Fascinating.<br> The result of stress? We've been under stress before.<br> It never set us at each other's throats.<br> - Well, this is war.<br> - There isn't any war! Or is there? - Have we forgotten how to defend.<br>.<br>? - Scotty.<br> What's happening to us? We've been trained to think in other terms than war.<br> We've been trained to fight its causes, if necessary.<br> Then why are we behaving like a group of savages? Look at me.<br> Look at me.<br> Two forces aboard this ship, each of them equally armed.<br> Has a war been staged for us? Complete with weapons, and ideology and patriotic drum-beating? Even Spock.<br> Even race hatred? Recent events would seem to be directed toward a magnification of the basic hostilities between humans and Klingons.<br> Apparently, it is by design that we fight.<br> - We seem to be pawns.<br> - But what's the game? And whose? And what are the rules? It is most urgent that we locate the alien entity immediately and determine its motives and a method for halting its activities.<br> Without sensors? All our power down? This thing could go anywhere.<br> Yes.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, report.<br> - No good, captain.<br> Circuits are in but systems just aren't responding.<br> We're getting something.<br> Aye, captain.<br> Power and life-support restored.<br> - Remotes on standby.<br> - Good work.<br> But, captain, I didn't do it.<br> Everything just came on by itself.<br> Their life-support systems have resumed.<br> - The sensors may be operating.<br> - Start scanning.<br> Let's find that alien.<br> - Holding steady.<br> - Cause them to be unsteady.<br> They appear to be controlled from another location.<br> Also unable to affect ship's course for return to our empire.<br> One of Kirk's tricks.<br> Could he bypass a circuit? What power supports our battle yet starves our victory? Power.<br> Interrupt it at their main life-support couplings.<br> Where? Number 6 Deck.<br> Come.<br> Alien detected in the Engineering section, near reactor number 3.<br> Let's go.<br> You don't die yet.<br> You're not human, but you're very beautiful.<br> Very beautiful.<br> Chekov.<br> Jim.<br> He's not responsible.<br> What have I done? There's an alien entity aboard the ship, it's forcing us to fight.<br> We don't want to.<br> We don't know what its motive is.<br> We're trying to find out.<br> You must help us.<br> Take me to Kang.<br> A temporary truce, that's all I ask.<br> Spock, take her.<br> Chekov.<br> Chekov.<br> Is this what's in store for us? From here on in? Violence? Hatred? Brain waves show almost paranoid mania.<br> What happened? He lost control.<br> So did I.<br> We're becoming animal warriors.<br> - Let's go, Spock.<br> - Orderly.<br> Jim, Johnson's heart wound is almost completely healed.<br> The same with the other casualties.<br> Sword wounds in the vital organs, massive trauma, shock.<br> They're all healing at a fantastic rate.<br> It would appear that the entity wants us alive.<br> Why? So we can fight and fight and keep coming back for more like some bloody coliseum? What's next? The roar of crowds? Perhaps human and Klingon psychologies and combat capabilities are being tested by an alien with designs on both powers.<br> Gentlemen, if we are pawns, you're looking at one who is extremely sorry.<br> I understand, doctor.<br> I too felt a brief surge of racial bigotry.<br> Most distasteful.<br> Let's find the alien.<br> You come with us.<br> Maybe we can prove to you that it exists.<br> What is it? Totally unfamiliar.<br> What did you want? What are you doing here? Reporting for duty, sir.<br> Duty? - Did McCoy release you from Sickbay? - I released myself.<br> Then get back to Sickbay.<br> Not on your life, sir.<br> I'm fit and ready for action.<br> The Klingons almost did me in once, and I'm out to even the score.<br> - I order you - I've got my orders.<br> I'm obeying orders.<br> Kill the Klingons.<br> - It's them or us, isn't it? - Johnson.<br> Fascinating.<br> During Lieutenant Johnson's emotional outburst, his expression of hatred and lust for vengeance, the alien's life-energy level increased.<br> When the lieutenant became unconscious, the alien lost energy.<br> It subsists on the emotions of others? This one appears to be strengthened by mental radiations of hostility, violent intentions.<br> It exists on the hate of others.<br> To put it simply.<br> And it has acted as a catalyst, creating this situation, in order to satisfy that need.<br> It has brought together opposing forces, provided crude instruments, in an effort to promote the most violent mode of conflict.<br> And kept numbers and resources balanced, so that it can maintain a constant state of violence.<br> It's got to have a vulnerable area.<br> We've got to get rid of it.<br> Then all hostile attitudes on board must be eliminated.<br> The fighting must end.<br> And soon.<br> Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare.<br> Kang has got to listen.<br> We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing.<br> Kang.<br> Kang, this is Captain Kirk.<br> Kang, do you read me? Commander, it's a trick.<br> Kang.<br> He won't answer.<br> The alien is affecting his mind, captain.<br> Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it.<br> Scotty, sir.<br> The ships dilithium crystals are deteriorating.<br> We can't stop the process.<br> Time factor? In 12 minutes, we'll be totally without engine power.<br> Well, do whatever you can.<br> Kirk out.<br> And so we drift in space, with only hatred and bloodshed aboard.<br> Now do you believe? Captain's log, stardate, Armageddon.<br> We must find a way to defeat the alien force of hate that has taken over the Enterprise, stop the war now, or spend eternity in futile, bloody violence.<br> There's no change, captain.<br> The dilithium crystals are discharging.<br> There's nothing we can do about it.<br> If I could talk to Kang, somehow cut through the Klingon lines, make peace before it's too late.<br> We have nine minutes, 53 seconds to power zero.<br> There is, of course, a logical alternative.<br> Kang's wife is after all our prisoner.<br> - Perhaps a threat - Aye.<br> Now that's something the Klingons would understand.<br> Kang.<br> Kang, this is Captain Kirk.<br> I know you can hear me so don't cut me off.<br> We have Mara, your wife.<br> We talk truce now, or she dies.<br> Reply.<br> She has five seconds to live.<br> Reply.<br> She is a victim of war, captain.<br> She understands.<br> He called my bluff.<br> You're not going.<br>.<br>? The Federation doesn't kill or mistreat its prisoners.<br> You've been listening to propaganda.<br> - How much time? - Eight minutes, 42 seconds.<br> - So this was no trick.<br> - It's the alien that's done this.<br> We're in its power.<br> Our people and yours.<br> We only wanted to stop the fighting to save us all.<br> We have always fought.<br> We must.<br> We are hunters, captain, tracking and taking what we need.<br> There are poor planets in the Klingon systems, we must push outward if we are to survive.<br> There's another way to survive.<br> Mutual trust and help.<br> I will help you now.<br> - How? - I will take you to Kang.<br> - I will add my voice to yours.<br> - I wouldn't trust her, captain.<br> We can't get through the Klingon defences in time.<br> Unless Spock.<br> Intra-ship beaming from one section to another.<br> It's possible? It has rarely been done because of the danger involved.<br> Pinpoint accuracy is required.<br> If the transportee should materialise inside a solid object, a deck or a wall Even if it could work, she may be leading you into a trap.<br> We're all in a trap.<br> This is the only way out.<br> - We'll go with you.<br> - No, that'll start the final battle.<br> I believe her.<br> Prepare the transporter.<br> We'll wait for your signal.<br> She can't guarantee that Kang will stop to listen.<br> Right, Mr.<br> Spock? No one can guarantee the actions of another.<br> Your automatic setting is laid in, captain.<br> When transporter is energized, you will have eight seconds to get to the pads.<br> I hope your computations are correct, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> You will know in 7.<br>9 seconds, captain.<br> Mara.<br> You're alive and you bring us a prize.<br> Kang, wait.<br> He's come alone, unarmed.<br> He must talk to you.<br> - Brave captain.<br> What about? - No! Listen to him.<br> - We are all in danger.<br> - Mara.<br> Before you start killing, give me one minute.<br> - Kang, don't.<br> - What have they done to you, Mara? Are you out of your mind? What have they done to you? I see why the human beast did not kill you.<br> They didn't harm me.<br> Listen to him.<br> Stop.<br> Stop, please! - With your death, we win.<br> - Nobody wins.<br> Have any more of your men died? We can't be killed.<br> There's an alien aboard.<br> It wants us alive.<br> No doubt you will reassemble after I've hacked you to bits.<br> You fool.<br> Look.<br> Look, Kang.<br> For the rest of our lives, a thousand lifetimes, senseless violence, fighting, while an alien has total control over us.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> In the heart, the head, I won't stay dead.<br> Next time, I'll do the same to you.<br> I'll kill you.<br> And it goes on, the good old game of war.<br> Pawn against pawn.<br> Stopping the bad guys, while somewhere, some thing sits back and laughs.<br> And starts it all over again.<br> - Let's jump him.<br> - Those who hate and fight must stop themselves, doctor, otherwise, it is not stopped.<br> Kang, I am your wife.<br> I'm a Klingon.<br> Would I lie for them? Listen to Kirk.<br> He is telling the truth.<br> Be a pawn, be a toy, be a good soldier that never questions orders.<br> Klingons kill for their own purposes.<br> All fighting must end, captain, to weaken the alien before our dilithium crystals are gone.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura.<br> - Yes, captain? - Put me on ship-wide intercom.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Ready, captain.<br> This is Captain Kirk.<br> A truce is ordered.<br> The fighting is over.<br> Lay down your weapons.<br> This is Kang.<br> Cease hostilities.<br> Disarm.<br> The cessation of violence appears to have weakened it, captain.<br> I suggest that good spirits might make an effective weapon.<br> Get off my ship.<br> You're a dead duck, you're powerless.<br> We know about you and we don't want to play.<br> Maybe there are others like you around, maybe you've caused a lot of suffering, a lot of history, but that's all over.<br> We'll be on guard now, we'll be ready for you, so ship out.<br> - Come on, haul it.<br> - Yeah, out already.<br> Out! We need no urging to hate humans.<br> But for the present, only a fool fights in a burning house.<br> Out!   <br>\n                </div>",

Confirm Chekov's coordinates for the missile's point of origin.<br> Correct, captain.<br> We are approaching those coordinates.<br> And that object on the screen? An asteroid, 200 miles in diameter.<br> Could the enemy vessel be hiding behind the asteroid? Negative, captain.<br> We've had that area on scanners constantly.<br> Then the asteroid is the missile's point of origin? Correct, captain.<br> Full sensor probe, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Typical asteroid chemically, but it is not orbiting.<br> It is pursuing an independent course through this solar system.<br> How could that be? Unless it's powered.<br> A spaceship? It is under power, captain.<br> And correcting for all gravitational stresses.<br> - Source of power? - Atomic, very archaic.<br> Leaving a trail of debris and hard radiation.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, plot the course - of the asteroid vessel.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Asteroid has an outer shell, which is hollow.<br> It surrounds an independent inner core, which has a breathable atmosphere.<br> Sensors read no life forms.<br> Then it must be on automatic controls.<br> Or the passengers, or builders, are dead.<br> Course of asteroid, I mean, spaceship, 241, mark 17.<br> - Interesting.<br> - Yes.<br> The course Ensign Chekov just gave for the asteroid would put it on a collision course with Daran V.<br> - Daran V? Inhabited.<br> - Correct.<br> Population approximately 3 billion, Estimated time of impact, 396 days.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, Match Enterprise speed with that of the asteroid vessel.<br> Mr.<br> Spock and I are transporting aboard.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, you have the Conn.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> A lot can happen in a year.<br> Please give yourself every minute.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, Mr.<br> Spock and I will handle this.<br> Without me, Jim? You'd never find your way back.<br> Well - I think it would be wiser if - I'd like to go.<br> I'm fine, captain.<br> All right, doctor.<br> If that's what you want.<br> You'd swear you were on the surface of a planet.<br> One fails to see the logic in making a ship look like a planet.<br> Wouldn't know this was a spaceship.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, Scott here.<br> Transported without incident.<br> Kirk out.<br> No apparent opening.<br> You've found no intelligent life forms, Mr.<br> Spock, but surely The asteroid ship is over 10,000 years old, doctor.<br> Still no sign of life forms, captain.<br> These are weapons? Of a sort.<br> Weapons, communication devices.<br> Let me go to my friend.<br> - You all right? - I think so.<br> I am Natira, the high priestess of the people.<br> Welcome to the world of Yonada.<br> I can't say I think much of your welcome.<br> Take them.<br> You will kneel.<br> She called this \"the world.<br>\" These people don't know they're on a spaceship.<br> They've been in flight 10,000 years.<br> Maybe they don't realise it.<br> Oh, Oracle of the people, most perfect and wise.<br> Strangers have come to our world.<br> They bear instruments we do not understand.<br> Who are you? I am Captain Kirk of the starship Enterprise.<br> This is my medical officer, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> My first officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> For what reason do you visit this world? We've come in friendship.<br> Then learn what it means to be our enemy before you learn what it means to be our friend.<br> Spock.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Bones.<br> Bones? The doctor must have received an excessively large electrical shock.<br> No, that's not it.<br> Nothing else could have caused this, captain.<br> At least, nothing that has happened here.<br> You're right, Spock.<br> The shock was serious because of McCoy's weakened condition.<br> May I ask precisely what is troubling the doctor? I don't think he would have told you himself, but I think you should know now.<br> It's xenopolycythemia.<br> Yes.<br> I know of it, captain.<br> Then you know that nothing can be done.<br> Bones, how is it? I'm all right.<br> - Are you all right, Mr.<br> Spock? - Very well, doctor.<br> The captain and I seem to have suffered no ill effects.<br> That Oracle really got to me.<br> I must be especially susceptible to its magic spells.<br> Spock knows.<br> Well, we better get to the control room.<br> - Are you in any condition to get up? - Don't worry, I can make it, Jim.<br> Captain, informing these people they're on a ship may be in violation of the Prime Directive of Starfleet Command.<br> No, the people of Yonada may be changed by the knowledge, but it's better than exterminating them.<br> - Logical, captain.<br> - And the 3 billion on Daran V.<br> Also logical, captain.<br> Gentlemen, I believe we have a visitor.<br> For strength.<br> Many of us have felt the power of our Oracle.<br> This has been of benefit.<br> Tastes like an ancient herb derivative.<br> - You are not of Yonada.<br> - No, we're from outside your world.<br> Where is outside? Up there.<br> Outside, up there, everywhere.<br> So they say, also.<br> Many years ago, I climbed the mountains, even though it is forbidden.<br> Why is it forbidden? I am not sure.<br> But things are not as they teach us.<br> For the world is hollow, and I have touched the sky.<br> What is it, Bones? There's something under the skin.<br> He's dead.<br> \"For the world is hollow and I have touched the sky.<br>\" He said it was forbidden to climb the mountains.<br> Yes, of course it is.<br> Because if you did, you'd touch the sky and find out that you were living on a big ball.<br> Not a planet, but a spaceship.<br> And that knowledge seems to be forbidden.<br> What happened? We don't know.<br> He just suddenly screamed in pain and died.<br> Fetch the guard.<br> Forgive him, for he was an old man.<br> And old men are sometimes foolish.<br> But it is written that those of the people who sin or speak evil shall be punished.<br> He served well for many years.<br> Take him away gently.<br> You do not seem well.<br> It is distressing to me.<br> Oh, no, I'm quite all right, thank you.<br> It is the will of the Oracle that you now be treated as honoured guests.<br> - You seem to be the special favourite.<br> - Indeed, doctor.<br> The young lady did show a marked preference for your company.<br> Well, now, nobody can blame her for that, can they? Personally, I find the lady's taste questionable.<br> But she obviously prefers you and you obviously don't seem to mind.<br> If you could arrange to be alone with the young lady, Spock and I would be left alone to find the power controls of this world.<br> It is time to refresh yourselves.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> To our good friends of Yonada.<br> - We are very interested in your world.<br> - That pleases us.<br> Good, then you wouldn't mind if we looked around? Not at all.<br> The people know of you now.<br> Are you well enough to go about? Perhaps not.<br> Then why not remain here? Rest, we will talk.<br> You are very kind.<br> You are free to go about and meet our people.<br> Thank you.<br> And thank you for taking care of Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Not at all.<br> We shall make him well.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No, thank you.<br> Leave us.<br> I'm curious.<br> How did the Oracle punish the old man? I cannot tell you now.<br> There is some way the Oracle knows what you say, isn't there? What we say, what we think.<br> The Oracle knows the minds and the hearts of all the people.<br> I did not know you would be hurt so badly.<br> It's all right.<br> I suppose we had to learn the power of the Oracle.<br> McCoy, there is something I must say.<br> Since the moment l It is not in the manner of the people to hide their feelings.<br> Honesty is usually wise.<br> Is there a woman for you? No, there isn't.<br> Does McCoy find me attractive? Oh, yes.<br> Yes, I do.<br> I hope you men of space, of other worlds, hold truth as dear as we do.<br> We do.<br> I wish you to stay here, on Yonada, as my mate.<br> But we're strangers to each other.<br> But is not that the nature of men and women? That the pleasure is in the learning of each other? Yes.<br> Let the thought rest in your heart, McCoy.<br> Incredible as it may seem, these people have no idea they're living on a spaceship.<br> I wonder how many generations have lived out their lives, and been buried here, without ever knowing that their world is hollow? The people, in the fullness of time, will reach a new world.<br> Rich, green, lovely to the eyes, and of a goodness that will fill the hearts of the people with tears of joy.<br> You can share that world with me, rule it by my side.<br> How long will it take you to reach this new world? Soon.<br> The Oracle will only say \"soon.<br>\" If you only knew how I needed some kind of future, Natira.<br> You have lived a lonely life? Yes, very lonely.<br> No more, McCoy.<br> There will be no more loneliness for you.<br> - There's something I need to tell you.<br> - There is nothing you need to say.<br> - But there is.<br> - Then tell me.<br> If the telling is such a need.<br> I have an illness for which there is no cure.<br> I have one year to live.<br> Until I saw you, there was nothing in my heart.<br> It sustained my life, but nothing more.<br> Now it sings.<br> I could be happy to have that feeling for a day a week, a month, a year.<br> Whatever the creators hold in store for us.<br> Captain, the Oracle room.<br> The problem: To get in.<br> I believe that I can The writing is definitely Fabrini, captain.<br> I recognise it.<br> Fabrini.<br> Didn't the Fabrini sun go nova and destroy its planets? Yes.<br> Toward the end, the Fabrini people lived underground as these people do to protect themselves.<br> Some of them must have been put aboard this ship.<br> And sent to another planet.<br> And these are their descendants.<br> Now.<br> The Oracle doesn't seem to know we're here.<br> - I wonder what alerted it the first time.<br> - Captain.<br> If I remember correctly, the Oracle's reprehensible conduct was initiated when Natira knelt on that platform.<br> I think you're right.<br> Continue investigating.<br> The clue to the location of the control room must be around here somewhere.<br> Nothing here would indicate this is anything but a planet.<br> There's no question, but that the creators would have been considered gods.<br> This plaque is a representation of a star and its solar system.<br> Eight planets, captain.<br> That is the number in the Fabrina solar system.<br> There's no doubt these people are descendants of the Fabrini.<br> None.<br> And no doubt that they've been in flight on this asteroid ship for 10,000 years.<br> Speak.<br> - It is I, Natira.<br> - Yes, Natira.<br> It is written that only the high priestess of the people may select her mate.<br> It is so written.<br> The strangers among us, the three visitors, there is one called McCoy.<br> I wish him to remain here, as my mate.<br> Does he agree to this? I have asked him.<br> He has not yet given me his answer.<br> He must become one of the people, worship the creators, and agree to the insertion of the Instrument of Obedience.<br> He will be told what must be done.<br> If he agrees to all things, it is permitted.<br> Teach him our laws carefully so he commits no sacrilege, no offence against the people or the creators.<br> It will be done, oh, most wise.<br> Who are the intruders? Two of the strangers, Kirk and Spock.<br> - McCoy is not with them? - No.<br> Kirk and Spock have committed sacrilege.<br> - You know what must be done.<br> - I know.<br> When the Oracle releases them, take them.<br> Fools.<br> You think we are children? You think you can do as you please, commit whatever offence amuses you? What are you going to do to my friends? They entered the Oracle room.<br> - And the punishment is death? - Yes.<br> I can make no other decision.<br> We gave them our trust, they betrayed us.<br> - They acted out of ignorance, Natira.<br> - They said they came in friendship.<br> - Please, let them return to the ship.<br> - I cannot.<br> For me? I've made my decision.<br> I'm staying here, on Yonada.<br> Natira.<br> What they did, they did because they felt they had to.<br> Please, let them return to the ship.<br> You won't regret it.<br> How do you think I'd feel if I stayed here with a chance to be happy for the first time in my life, but knowing my friends had died? Yes.<br> So be it.<br> This I will do for McCoy.<br> For our happiness and future.<br> - You're returning with us? - No, I'm not.<br> Bones, this isn't a planet, it's a spaceship, on a collision course with Daran V.<br> I'm on a kind of a collision course myself, Jim.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, I order you to return with us.<br> And I refuse.<br> Bones, if we can't correct the course of this ship, we'll have to blast it out of space.<br> I intend to stay on this ship with these people, whatever happens.<br> Your decision is most illogical, doctor.<br> Is it, Mr.<br> Spock? Is it really? Natira's asked me to stay and I'm staying.<br> - As her husband? - Yes.<br> Is that too much to ask, Jim? - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Scott here, captain.<br> We're beaming over.<br> Lock in on our signal.<br> Aye, captain.<br> And transport Mr.<br> Spock and myself immediately.<br> But, captain, what about Dr.<br> McCoy? He's staying, Scotty.<br> Kirk out.<br> To become one of the people of Yonada, the Instrument of Obedience must be made part of your flesh.<br> Do you now give your consent? - I do.<br> - Proceed.<br> Say now because once done, it is done.<br> Let it be done.<br> You are now one with my people.<br> May I give you the love you want, and make the time you have beautiful.<br> We are now of one mind.<br> One heart.<br> One life.<br> It is done, oh, most wise.<br> Our living link with the creators.<br> Teach him, then, what he must know as one of the people.<br> This is the Book of the People, to be opened and read when we reach the new world of the promise.<br> It was given by the creators.<br> Do the people know the contents of their book? Only that it tells of our world here and why soon one day we must leave it for the new world.<br> Has the reason that the people must leave here been revealed to you? No, it has not.<br> - Don't you long to know its secrets? - No.<br> It is enough for me to know that we shall understand all when we reach our home.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5476.<br>4.<br> We are on a parallel course with Yonada.<br> It is still on a collision course with Daran V.<br> Our failure to correct its course, and the critical nature of Dr.<br> McCoy's illness, made contact with Starfleet Command imperative.<br> Captain Kirk, I sympathise with your wish to stay.<br> But I hope you recognise the necessity that you continue your mission at once.<br> - That is the problem, sir.<br> - Perhaps I haven't made myself clear.<br> Let me restate it.<br> You have been relieved of all responsibility for the asteroid ship Yonada.<br> Starfleet Command will take care of the situation.<br> I believe it is time to move on.<br> Yes, those are the orders.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> An urgent call from Dr.<br> McCoy, sir.<br> - Put him on.<br> - Jim? Yes, Bones.<br> We may be able to get these people back on course.<br> You've located the controls? No, but I've seen the book that contains all the knowledge of the creators.<br> And if you If you can get to it Spock - Dig out the information.<br> - Where is it? Bones, are you all right? Bones, answer me! Bones, what is it? Bones, what is it? McCoy, what's happening? What's happening, McCoy? You are killers of your friend.<br> - I will have you put to death.<br> - Help him.<br> Until you are dead, he will think of you and disobey.<br> - I will see you die! - Spock, take care of McCoy.<br> He is not part of our people.<br> You've released him from his vow of obedience.<br> We have freed him from the cruelty of your Oracle.<br> Bones.<br> Bones.<br> You said something about a book.<br> Where is it? They must not know.<br> The Oracle room.<br> You will never see the book.<br> It is sacrilege.<br> Guards! Guards! Guards! Now listen to me.<br> You must listen to what I have to say.<br> Give me one moment to speak to you.<br> One moment.<br> Natira.<br> If you don't believe what I'm about to tell you, you can call the guards.<br> We'll accept any punishment you decree.<br> What do you wish to say? You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth.<br> Your truth.<br> Of your world.<br> Yes, my world and your world of Yonada.<br> You do not obey the law of the creators.<br> How can you understand my world? I understand.<br> I understand, Natira.<br> Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying, and with it, its world.<br> It's the world you see on the plaque in the room of the Oracle.<br> That is the world of which Yonada is a part.<br> No.<br> It is the world of your ancestors, your creators.<br> It no longer exists.<br> You are mad.<br> No, I'm not.<br> Listen to me! Hear me out.<br> When your ancestors discovered that their world was dying, they built a great ship and chose their best people.<br> They wished for their race to survive.<br> They sent the ship out into space.<br> You wish me to believe that Yonada is a ship? Yes.<br> But we have a sun.<br> It did not die.<br> And at night I see the stars.<br> No.<br> You are living inside a hollow ball.<br> Your ancestors created it to take you on a journey.<br> To a promised new planet.<br> Why should the truth wait for you to come to Yonada? Because a flaw developed in the controls, and unless we correct it, Yonada will kill millions of people and destroy a world it doesn't know.<br> Why should the truth be kept from us? Why should the creators keep us in darkness? No.<br> No.<br> You do not speak the truth.<br> I believe only the Oracle.<br> I believe Let us remove the Instrument of Obedience, the way we did for McCoy.<br> Natira.<br> Do you think she understood me? She evidently understood something.<br> There are no guards to detain us.<br> You have listened to the words of the non-believers.<br> Yes, I have listened.<br> That was the first transgression.<br> You felt the pain of warning? - Yes, I did.<br> - Why did you listen further? - They said they spoke the truth.<br> - Their truth.<br> - Is truth not truth for all? - The truth of Yonada is your truth.<br> There can be no other for you.<br> Repent your disobedience.<br> I must know the truth of the world.<br> Your friends have told me of your world.<br> They spoke the truth.<br> I believe you.<br> I believe.<br> The creators kept us in darkness.<br> There's nothing I can do.<br> I believe with you, husband.<br> - Is she all right? - She will be.<br> I'll stay here with her.<br> The book is in the monolith.<br> It is sacrilege to the temple.<br> We do this for the survival of the people of Yonada.<br> You are not believers.<br> You are forbidden to gaze at the book.<br> We mean no desecration to the faith of Yonada.<br> We must consult the book to help you.<br> It is blasphemy.<br> You are forbidden.<br> The punishment is death.<br> Temperature 111 degrees and rising.<br> - McCoy, how do you open this thing? - Temperature 115 degrees.<br> Press the three lower planets on the left-hand side simultaneously.<br> Here.<br> The plan must be in there.<br> - Is it indexed? - Yes, it is.<br> Hurry, Spock.<br> It refers to the altar.<br> Apply pressure to the centre until it opens.<br> - Get her out of the heat.<br> - I've neutralised the heating elements.<br> We'll be all right here, now, Jim.<br> The Oracle can no longer punish us.<br> - Your friends have prevented it? - Yes.<br> And will they send this ship, again to the land the creators intended? Yes.<br> That is good.<br> Active and functional.<br> Not too different from the Enterprise.<br> There seems to be a weakness in one of the eight tubes.<br> - Enough to turn it off course? - Yes.<br> Let me check that engine.<br> A very simple problem, easy to correct.<br> Then come.<br> - No.<br> - Don't be afraid.<br> I do not fear the punishment of disobedience.<br> - Well, then come, we must hurry - No, I cannot go with you.<br> It is not fear.<br> I understand the great purpose of the creators.<br> I shall honour it.<br> You intend to stay here, on Yonada? I shall stay willingly, and because that is what I must do.<br> Then I won't leave you.<br> Will McCoy stay here to die? No, McCoy will not let go of life in the fullness of years.<br> Now, more than ever, I wish to search through the universe.<br> To find a cure for myself and all others like me.<br> And I want you to be with me.<br> This is my universe.<br> You came here with a great mission.<br> To save my people.<br> Shall I abandon them? Perhaps one day, if it is permitted, you will find Yonada again.<br> I believe we can attempt the course correction, captain.<br> Good.<br> Going back to marked headings.<br> Guidance controls taking over.<br> I believe we can allow the ship to go back to its automatic control.<br> Steadying on course marked in red.<br> Captain.<br> Intelligence files.<br> Their banks contain the total knowledge of the Fabrini, ready for the people to consult when they arrive at their destination.<br> And they seem to have amassed a great deal of medical knowledge.<br> Excellent, doctor.<br> The white corpuscle count is back to normal.<br> Your haemoglobin count is back to normal, doctor, which indicates that the flow of oxygen to each cell of your body is back up to its abundantly energetic level.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock, for bringing back the knowledge of the Fabrini.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, the Fabrini descendants are scheduled to debark on their promised planet in approximately 390 days.<br> I think that we could manage to be in that vicinity at that time.<br> If you wanted to thank the Fabrini personally.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

We can barely read it, but I don't like the looks of it, and I cannot find out the cause.<br> Captain.<br> Visual detection of an object dead ahead.<br> - How about it, Spock? - Fascinating.<br> - Explain.<br> - There is virtually no sensor contact.<br> No mass analysis, no trace of radiation.<br> We see it, but our sensors indicate it is not there.<br> The Defiant.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, impulse engines only.<br> - Close to transporter range.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Lieutenant, open up a hailing frequency.<br> I've been trying to raise them, sir.<br> There is no response.<br> - Just within transporter range, sir.<br> - Good.<br> Maintain position.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, Mr.<br> Chekov, come with me.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, report to the transporter room immediately.<br> - Scotty, you have the con.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Locked in on the Defiant bridge, sir.<br> - Energise.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Has there ever been a mutiny on a starship before? Absolutely no record of such an occurrence, ensign.<br> Jim.<br> The captain's neck is broken.<br> The ship is still functioning, captain.<br> It is logical to assume the mutineers are somewhere aboard.<br> Use the ship's sensors to locate them.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> Prepare to beam over a full security squad on my orders.<br> - Aye, aye, captain.<br> - Captain, there is no sign of life aboard this vessel.<br> Odd, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Very odd.<br> Spock, you stay here with me.<br> Chekov, get down to Engineering and life-support systems.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, check out the Sickbay.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Cancel the security squad and stand by for further instructions.<br> Aye, aye, captain.<br> Standing by.<br> I can't get an accurate fix on the Defiant, Mr.<br> Scott, but I know it's drifting away from us.<br> Shall I correct for range, sir? Aye.<br> I think you're right.<br> Keep us within beaming range, but not too close.<br> - Captain.<br> - Report, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Just like what I found in Life Support.<br> All dead.<br> Get back up here.<br> - Kirk to McCoy.<br> - McCoy here.<br> Bones, can you tell me what they all died of? I'd say these people killed each other.<br> They what? You heard correctly, Jim.<br> These people killed each other.<br> Could mental disease have infected all of the crew? According to the ship's log, the medical surgeon down here didn't even know what was going on.<br> The best I can do is get all the readings I can get and analyse them later.<br> What the devil? Bones, what is it? Bones, what is it? Answer me.<br> - Answer me.<br> - Jim, this ship is dissolving.<br> My hand just passed through a man and a table.<br> Get back up here on the double.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, the Defiant.<br> It's starting to disappear.<br> Bridge to transporter room.<br> Transporter room.<br> O'Neil here.<br> You got that transporter working, mister? No, sir.<br> Not yet.<br> Take over, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> I'll be in the transporter room.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Captain, the Defiant's sensors correspond with an extremely high degree of correlation to those of the Enterprise.<br> You mean what happened to the Defiant might be happening to the Enterprise? Affirmative.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Scott here.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, stand by to beam us back.<br> - I can't, sir.<br> At least not all at once.<br> - Why not? What's happen.<br>.<br>? Everything.<br> That ship you're in is fading out and it's Well, it's ripping the innards out of this one.<br> It's jamming our transporter frequencies.<br> I've only got three of them working and I'm not sure of those.<br> One of you has got to wait.<br> Chekov, McCoy, prepare for transportation.<br> You too, Spock.<br> Request permission to remain, captain.<br> - I could be completing the data.<br> - Request denied.<br> Captain, there is a chance I know what the chances are, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Don't argue.<br> Get back with the information.<br> I'll be right there.<br> - Scotty, energise transporter.<br> - Aye.<br> Energise.<br> It's gone.<br> The Defiant just vanished.<br> Anything? Negative.<br> That's it.<br> I've done all I can.<br> There's nothing out there to grab ahold of and bring in.<br> When that ship went, it must have taken the captain with it.<br> Computer working.<br> Compute the next period of spatial interphase.<br> Next interphase two hours, Two hours and 12 minutes? That power leak has done damage to the ship and she's starting to drift.<br> I can't hold her in place that long.<br> We must try, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> The fabric of space is very weak here.<br> If we disturb it, there will be no chance of retrieving the captain alive.<br> I don't understand what's so special about this region of space.<br> Picture it this way, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> We exist in a universe which coexists with a multitude of others in the same physical space.<br> At certain brief periods of time, an area of their space overlaps an area of ours.<br> That is the time of interphase, during which we can connect with the Defiant's universe.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? We will be able to retrieve the captain at that time, won't we? Yes.<br> However, the dimensional structure of each universe is totally dissimilar.<br> Any use of power disturbs it.<br> If we are not extremely careful, we shall lose the captain and become trapped ourselves.<br> - I see.<br> - And die like him? Chekov.<br> Chekov! - Security guards to the Bridge.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> What happened, Mr.<br> Spock? I was attempting to explain to Mr.<br> Chekov the nature of our problems in this situation when he attacked.<br> Did anyone notice anything peculiar in his behaviour before this? I think he had several spasms of pain.<br> - Did he seem to be getting hysterical? - Doctor, he seemed more angry than frightened.<br> He had no cause to be angry.<br> Take Mr.<br> Chekov to Sickbay.<br> Put him under restraint.<br> Lieutenant Uhura is correct.<br> There was murderous fury in Chekov, the same fury which was evident in the Defiant.<br> That's what I was afraid of.<br> Whatever it was that drove the crew of the Defiant to murder each other could be communicable.<br> Is there anything you need to isolate the cause? Time.<br> Oh, and by the way, Mr.<br> Spock, I think it might be a wise precaution to put some distance between us and the Defiant.<br> If we are to recover the captain, we must not move.<br> How long will that take? Approximately two hours before the attempt can be made.<br> Spock, are you sure that Jim is still alive? The captain was caught in our transporter beam when the Defiant phased out.<br> It is possible he was spared the shock of transition and survived.<br> However, if we are to recover him, we must catch him at the precise moment during the next interphase or he will die, and there can be no margin for error.<br> His environmental unit can provide breathable air for no more than 3.<br>62 hours.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A vessel approaching on an intercept vector.<br> - Status, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Range 200,000 kilometres.<br> Velocity 0.<br>51 c.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura, signal red alert.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Red alert.<br> All decks go to red alert.<br> Security confirmed.<br> Security confirmed.<br> Will do.<br> They've stopped dead, sir.<br> Range 90,000 kilometres and holding.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? I'm receiving a visual signal.<br> Transfer to main viewer.<br> Aye, sir.<br> I am Commander Loskene.<br> You are trespassing in a territorial annex of the Tholian Assembly.<br> You must leave this area immediately.<br> Spock, in command of the Federation starship Enterprise.<br> Commander, according to the Federation, this area is free space.<br> We claim this territory and are prepared to use force, if necessary, to protect our property.<br> We are not interested in your display of force.<br> The Enterprise is responding to a distress signal from one of our ships and is currently engaged in rescue operations.<br> - Do you wish to assist us? - I find no evidence of a disabled ship.<br> My instruments indicate that ours are the only two vessels in this area.<br> The other ship is interspatially trapped.<br> It should reappear in one hour and 53 minutes.<br> - We request you stand by until then.<br> - Very well, Enterprise.<br> In the interest of interstellar amity, we will wait precisely one hour and 53 minutes.<br> But be correct.<br> We do not tolerate deceit.<br> If we could only find the proper filtering agent, we might be able to solve this problem.<br> Negative.<br> It's the third failure.<br> I tell you, nurse, take this sample and run an analysis on it.<br> Yes, doctor.<br> - Bridge to transporter room.<br> - Transporter room here.<br> Ready for interphase in 20 seconds.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy! Thank you, nurse.<br> Call security.<br> I wanna have some checks run on this man.<br> Lock onto Captain Kirk's coordinates and prepare to bring him aboard, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Bring him aboard, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - I'm trying.<br> Captain Kirk is not on his designated coordinates, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Well, keep trying, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Lieutenant Sulu, evaluation.<br> Sensor readings are not corresponding to those we received the last time we saw the Defiant.<br> It is possible the Tholian entry into the area has disturbed the space.<br> - And if that has occurred - McCoy to Bridge.<br> Spock here.<br> Has the captain been beamed aboard yet? Negative, doctor.<br> Well, when is that interphase gonna happen? Theoretically, it already has happened, doctor.<br> However, the ship's sensors are not responding as predicted.<br> - I thought you had the thing timed out.<br> - I did, doctor.<br> The space was disturbed by the Tholians.<br> You don't know whether you're gonna be able to recover the captain or not? Not at this interphase.<br> I shall have to recalculate to determine when the next interphase will occur.<br> They do not take place at regular intervals.<br> You can't wait for the next one.<br> We've had another case like Chekov.<br> I've had to confine my orderly to Sickbay.<br> I have confidence that you will soon isolate the cause, doctor, and prevent any further spread of the affliction.<br> The disease is not transmitted by the men, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The cause is the area of space we're in.<br> It's affecting the whole crew.<br> The molecular structure of the brain tissues in the central nervous system are distorting.<br> And the madness that affected the Defiant's crew will soon happen to the Enterprise.<br> Now, you've got to get this ship out of here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we're being fired upon.<br> - The renowned Tholian punctuality.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Damage control report.<br> Minor structural damage to sections A-4 and C-13.<br> Engineering, hold power steady and cut off all unnecessary expenditures.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, divert all but emergency maintenance power to the shields.<br> But sir, that will reduce our phaser power by 50 percent.<br> Mr.<br> Spock! Scott to Bridge.<br> Spock here.<br> I know you don't like to use the phasers, but you've got to do something about that ship out there.<br> Understood.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, open a channel to the Tholian ship.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, - lock in phaser tracking controls.<br> - Phasers locked in, sir.<br> There's no response on any frequency, sir.<br> What's the use of this battle, Spock? You've lost Jim.<br> - Take the ship out of here.<br> - Ready, Mr.<br> Sulu? Ready, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Fire.<br> A hit, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Engineering, status report.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott? - Spock, that hit we took from the Tholians has fused our power supply converters.<br> I can't do a thing with the Enterprise now.<br> She's bound to drift.<br> Maybe right through that doorway out there.<br> Can you estimate minimum time required for repair? I don't even know if she can be repaired.<br> Are you satisfied? - Spock, why did you do it? - The decision to fight was logical.<br> Lack of time prevented any other course of action.<br> The Tholian ship had to be disabled.<br> You should have known what could have happened and done everything in your power to safeguard your crew.<br> That is the mark of a starship captain.<br> Like Jim.<br> Doctor, I hardly believe this is the time for comparisons.<br> Please go at once to your laboratory and search for an antidote to the effects of this space.<br> That is your primary task, since we must remain here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, something has just entered sensor range.<br> It's another Tholian, sir.<br> Loskene must have contacted them when he tried to intercept us.<br> Fascinating.<br> Shall I lock in remaining phaser power, sir? Negative.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, can you open a channel to the approaching vessel? They're refusing reception, sir.<br> I can't Distance, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Just beyond phaser range, sir.<br> What is that? Mr.<br> Sulu, I shall run an analysis on those filaments.<br> Tie in all sensors to the ship's library's computer console.<br> - Switch scanners.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> There is no analogue to this structure in Federation technology.<br> It is, however, an energy field, and if the Tholians are successful in completing this structure before we have completed our repairs, we shall not see home again.<br> Doctor, your last report on an antidote on the effects of this space was negative.<br> It's still negative, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Theragen seems to be the most promising substance tested so far.<br> - We're progressing.<br> - The urgency requires your attention in the laboratory.<br> My staff is working around the clock.<br> My being there will not affect the biochemistry of any of the tests.<br> This service requires my personal attention, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> A few hours ago, the captain elected to remain onboard the Defiant so that three members of his crew would have the best chance of returning safely to the Enterprise.<br> His concern was not only for them, but for all the members of the crew of this ship.<br> You all know the sequence of events.<br> We were fired upon by the Tholian ship.<br> At that time, Captain Kirk may have been alive.<br> I deemed it necessary to return the Tholian fire for the safety of the Enterprise.<br> The Tholian ship has been disabled, but as a result of the battle, we must accept the fact that Captain Kirk is no longer alive.<br> Take him to Sickbay.<br> Put him in restraints.<br> I shall not attempt to voice the quality of respect and admiration which Captain Kirk commanded.<br> Each of you must evaluate the loss in the privacy of your own thoughts.<br> Attention.<br> Dismissed.<br> There is a duty to be performed in the captain's quarters which requires our presence.<br> It can wait, doctor.<br> My duties require my immediate presence on the bridge.<br> The captain left a message tape.<br> It was his order that it be reviewed by both of us should he ever be declared dead.<br> You have just declared Jim dead.<br> It will wait for a more suitable moment, doctor.<br> Why? Are you afraid it will change your present status? The mental and physical state of this crew are your responsibility, doctor.<br> At the moment, they are your top priority.<br> The captain's last order is top priority, and you will honour that order before you take over.<br> He was a hero in every sense of the word, yet his life was sacrificed for nothing.<br> The one thing that would have given his death meaning is the safety of the Enterprise.<br> Now you've made that impossible, Mr.<br> S We came here for a specific purpose, doctor.<br> Maybe not the same one.<br> I really came here to find out why you stayed and fought.<br> The captain would have remained to recover a member of the crew at the risk of his own life or even the ship.<br> Yes, he would, Mr.<br> Spock, but you didn't have that decision to make.<br> What did you have to gain by fighting the Tholians? You could have assured yourself of a captaincy by leaving the area, but you chose to stay.<br> Why? I need not explain my rationale to you or to any other member of this crew.<br> There is a margin of variation in any experiment.<br> While there was a chance, I was bound legally and morally to ascertain the captain's status.<br> You mean to be sure if he was dead.<br> - Well, you made certain of that.<br> - That is enough, doctor.<br> - We both have other things to do.<br> - Yes, I have something to do.<br> If this crew is to survive, I have to find an antidote to this space you've locked us into.<br> You'll return to your duty as soon as we've discharged our responsibilities here.<br> There's no hurry, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The antidote probably doesn't concern you.<br> Vulcans are probably immune, so just take your time.<br> I must admit I don't understand you, Spock, but I just can't believe that you'd want Jim's command.<br> You must know that if you get us out of this situation, they'll pin a medal on your chest and give you command of the Enterprise.<br> Doctor, I am in command of the Enterprise.<br> I would like to remedy that situation.<br> If you believe I have acted irregularly, then relieve me of duty.<br> That is your prerogative as medical officer of this ship.<br> Bones, Spock, since you're playing this tape, we will assume that I am dead, and the tactical situation is critical, and both of you are locked in mortal combat.<br> It means, Spock, that you have control of the ship and are probably making the most difficult decisions of your career.<br> I can offer only one small piece of advice, for whatever it's worth.<br> Use every scrap of knowledge and logic you have to save the ship, but temper your judgement with intuitive insight.<br> I believe you have those qualities, but if you can't find them in yourself, seek out McCoy.<br> Ask his advice, and if you find it sound, take it.<br> Bones, you've heard what I've just told Spock.<br> Help him if you can, but remember he is the captain.<br> His decisions must be followed without question.<br> You might find that he is capable of human insight and human error.<br> They are most difficult to defend.<br> But you will find that he is deserving of the same loyalty and confidence each of you have given me.<br> Take care.<br> Spock, I I'm sorry.<br> It does hurt, doesn't it? What would you have me say, doctor? Spock here.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we have a readout on the Tholian tractor field.<br> I think we can estimate its approximate completion time.<br> I shall be there shortly.<br> Doctor, I believe we each have our respective tasks to complete before the Tholians complete theirs.<br> Captain! Captain Kirk, we thought you were Spock! Mr.<br> S - Doctor, I have just seen Captain - Of course you have, Uhura.<br> - We would all like to see him.<br> - He's alive.<br> He's alive, doctor.<br> - Of course.<br> - Believe me.<br> I did see him.<br> I did.<br> Spock! Mr.<br> Spock! - We're going to Sickbay.<br> - Doctor.<br> Doctor, I'm not going mad.<br> I did see Captain Kirk.<br> I've got to get to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Scott to captain.<br> Scott to captain.<br> Spock here.<br> Proceed, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> One of our crewmen just went berserk, but we have him under control.<br> Report to Dr.<br> McCoy all symptoms noted prior to the attack.<br> Spock out.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Yes, nurse.<br> I have a diagnosis of the crewman who attacked Engineer Scott.<br> It was definitely due to the deteriorative effects of interspace.<br> Yes, it's beginning to spread generally throughout the ship.<br> Are we any closer, doctor? No, except I'm positive that it's a theragen derivative that's the answer.<br> It better be the next one.<br> Mr.<br> Spock didn't believe me either, did he, doctor? Well, nobody saw it but you, Uhura.<br> Then I didn't really see him, did I? I don't think so.<br> - Will I become like Chekov, doctor? - No.<br> We're working hard.<br> We'll find an antidote.<br> - We're beginning to interphase.<br> - I'm all right.<br> - Scott to Bridge.<br> - Bridge.<br> Spock here.<br> - Are we slipping into interspace? - Negative.<br> We are relatively stable at the moment.<br> Why do you ask? I don't believe it.<br> What is it, Mr.<br> Scott? Mr.<br> Scott? Mr.<br> Spock, I've just seen Captain Kirk.<br> He was standing there just as plain as we are.<br> And then he disappeared.<br> Report to the bridge immediately.<br> That sounds like Uhura's story.<br> You suppose there's any truth in it? In critical moments, men sometimes see exactly what they wish to see.<br> Do you suppose they're seeing Jim because they've lost confidence in you? - I was merely stating a fact, doctor.<br> - It's getting critical.<br> There have been a number of assaults down on the lower decks.<br> Even Scotty's being affected.<br> If Scotty goes under, that's the finish of whatever chance we have of getting the Enterprise out of here.<br> Please leave that to me, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> I realise that the crew are your prime concern.<br> You can best serve them in your laboratory.<br> I urge you to confine yourself to it until a remedy has been found.<br> Spock! Must be this space.<br> It's getting to me too.<br> I I know it's nothing you've done, Spock.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I understand, doctor.<br> I'm sure the captain would simply have said, \"Forget it, Bones.<br>\" Mr.<br> Spock, look.<br> Captain.<br> Captain? Captain.<br> - Am I all right, doctor? - Yes, Uhura, you're fine.<br> - Then what I saw - It was real.<br> Captain Kirk's alive? We all saw him.<br> The captain's still alive.<br> - Nurse Chapel to Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - McCoy here.<br> Results of the last theragen test ready for you, doctor.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Then your fears about that phaser were correct.<br> It blasted a hole right through that crazy space fabric, and only heaven knows where it sent the Defiant.<br> Exactly.<br> But the captain remained.<br> Only the overlap time changed.<br> The next interphase will occur here.<br> Can you be ready? That will be about 20 minutes.<br> Aye, she'll be back together.<br> But we'll only have about It will have to do, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Come.<br> - What have you got there? - Compliments of the house.<br> To your good health and the health of the crew.<br> You've found the antidote, doctor.<br> Yes, and I've ordered it orally or intravenously for everyone aboard the ship.<br> I would like for you gentlemen to drink it down.<br> Ensign Chekov was affected so early.<br> Has he responded to it? He is his smiling self again, and I've discharged him from Sickbay.<br> - What is it? - It's a diluted theragen derivative.<br> Theragen? A nerve gas used by the Klingons.<br> Aye, and deadly too.<br> What are you thinking of? You're trying to kill us all.<br> If I remember correctly, it caused fatality only when used in pure form.<br> That's right, and in this derivative, mixed with alcohol, it merely deadens certain nerve inputs to the brain.<br> Oh, well, any decent brand of Scotch will do that.<br> One good slug of this and you could hit a man with phaser stun and he'd never feel it or even know it.<br> Does it make a good mix with Scotch? It should.<br> I'll let you know.<br> Drink it down, Spock.<br> It's the human thing to do.<br> That's a medical order, captain.<br> - Welcome back, lieutenant.<br> - Thank you, sir.<br> Your absence was keenly felt, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Estimated time for completion of the Tholian web.<br> Two minutes, sir.<br> Are the ship's computers programmed for entry into interspace? Yes, sir.<br> The ship can drive into interspace at any time.<br> - Spock to Engineering.<br> - Scott here.<br> Prepare for interphase in 15 seconds.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Standing by.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, they're getting ready to close the web.<br> Interphase in ten seconds.<br> Nine, eight, seven, six, five - Stand by with full power.<br> - She's only up to 76 percent.<br> - It will have to do.<br> - One.<br> Ready to transport on my order.<br> - I see him.<br> - There he is.<br> It's the captain.<br> - Sir, the tractor field is activated.<br> - We're being pulled out of here.<br> Try to maintain position, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> I can't, sir.<br> Engineering, bring ship's power up to full capability.<br> Where are we now, Mr.<br> Spock? Captain, we have destroyed the Tholians' web.<br> Negative, ensign.<br> Utilising ship's power has thrown us clear of it.<br> Compute the distance from the original location.<br> - At once, sir.<br> - Have we lost the captain? We shall soon see, lieutenant.<br> The ship has been drawn exactly distant from our previous position.<br> Good.<br> Since the captain was locked into our transporter beam when we were thrown clear of the interphase area, he should have been drawn here with us.<br> - Spock to transporter room.<br> - McCoy here.<br> The captain's oxygen supply is running out now.<br> Are you standing by with a hypo of triox compound for him? Ready, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Prepare to transport on the captain's coordinates on my order.<br> Ready, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, it's him.<br> It's the captain! I see him, ensign.<br> I see him.<br> Now, doctor.<br> - Bones.<br> - Welcome home, Jim.<br> I had a whole universe to myself after the Defiant was thrown out.<br> There was absolutely no one else in it.<br> I must say, I prefer a crowded universe much better.<br> How did you two get along without me? Oh, we managed.<br> Mr.<br> Spock gave the orders and I found the answers.<br> - Good.<br> No problems between you? - None worth reporting, captain.<br> Try me.<br> Only such minor disturbances as are inevitable when humans are involved.<br> Which humans, Mr.<br> Spock? He means that when humans become involved with Vulcans, Jim.<br> Yes.<br> I understand.<br> I hope my last orders were helpful in solving any problems that you don't feel worth reporting.<br> Orders, captain? What orders are you referring to, Jim? My last orders.<br> The last orders that I left for both of you.<br> - The last taped orders.<br> - Oh, those orders.<br> Well, there wasn't time.<br> We never had a chance to listen to them.<br> No, you see, the crisis was upon us and then passed so quickly, captain, that we Good.<br> Good.<br> Well, I hope we won't have similar opportunities to test those orders which you never heard.<br> - Ahead warp factor 2, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Warp factor 2, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

That's right.<br> Alexander, at your service.<br> I sing, I dance, I play all variety of games.<br> And I'm a good loser.<br> A very good loser.<br> Please try to bear that in mind.<br> But now, would you please accompany me? Who are the inhabitants of this planet? Platonians.<br> I'm sure you've never heard of us.<br> Our native star is Sahndara.<br> Millennia ago, just before it went nova, we managed to escape.<br> Our leader liked Plato's ideas.<br> Plato, Platonius, see? In fact our present philosopher-king, Parmen, sometimes calls us Plato's children, although we sometimes think of ourselves more as Plato's stepchildren.<br> Excuse me, someone's waiting for you.<br> Welcome to our republic.<br> Who among you is the physician? I am.<br> What's the problem? My spouse, his leg.<br> Come this way.<br> What happened to that leg? I suppose I scratched it.<br> I don't understand, this should've been attended to immediately.<br> Sheer ignorance.<br> Is there anything you can do? Well, we're certainly gonna try.<br> The infection is massive.<br> Let me give you a hypo to ease the pain.<br> - Where? - In the arm.<br> Philana, they came to help.<br> They deserve better than to die.<br> Alexander, you talk too much.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5784.<br>3.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is endeavouring to treat the leader of a strange group of people.<br> When their planet novaed, millennia ago, they transported themselves to Earth during the time of Socrates and Plato.<br> After the death of the Greek civilisation they idolized, they came to this planet and created for themselves a utopia patterned after it.<br> What is it? What is your prognosis, doctor? I'll let you know when I have the results.<br> And from now on, it would be better if I handle the instruments without your help.<br> Bones, I can't understand why a simple cut like that could become so serious.<br> Neither do I, but it has.<br> How do I knock out an infection when the tricorder doesn't show any information on Platonius bacteria? All I can do, and this is gonna take time, is to try to match his bugs with a known strain and hope.<br> Your Pan is in jeopardy.<br> It isn't now.<br> I win.<br> - Well played, Eraclitus.<br> - Thank you, Dionyd.<br> This psychokinetic power of yours, How long have you had it? Two and a half Ever since our arrival here on Platonius.<br> - How is the power transmitted? - Brain waves.<br> Do these waves cease while you're asleep? No, not if they're embedded in the unconscious.<br> What about medicine? Why no doctors? We haven't had any pressing need for the medical arts.<br> You see, while still on Sahndara, we instituted a mass eugenics programme.<br> We're the result.<br> Pared down to a population of 38, we're perfect for our utopia.<br> We're bred for contemplation and self-reliance.<br> And longevity.<br> How old would you say I am? Don't be afraid.<br> I'm not vain.<br> - Thirty-five.<br> - That old? I stopped ageing at 30.<br> Well, anyway, you're off by 2000 years.<br> I'm 2300 years old.<br> We were married very young.<br> I was only 117.<br> And he was 128.<br> So you see, we scarcely have to move anymore, let alone work.<br> - That's why you have no resistance? - That's right.<br> A break in the skin or a cut can be fatal.<br> Fascinating.<br> I believe we're experiencing the psychokinetic manifestations of Parmen's delirium.<br> - Scott to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Captain, we're in the midst of a storm.<br> No discernible cause.<br> I've never seen anything like it.<br> There's 10-scale turbulence right now.<br> Emergency gyros and stabilizers at maximum.<br> If this keeps up, captain, we can't last.<br> Engines at full speed.<br> Get her out of orbit and into space.<br> I've tried that, sir.<br> She's locked tight.<br> Then there's nothing you can do but batten down and weather.<br> Right, captain.<br> Parmen's mind is not Watch it! He's not only throwing the furniture, he's tearing up the Enterprise as well.<br> Bones, knock him out, fast.<br> Help! Save me! Alexander.<br> - Stand behind me.<br> - His mind will find me anyhow.<br> Don't save him.<br> Let him die.<br> The others will all kill each other trying to take his place.<br> - Hurry up with that shot.<br> - Now, doctor! I can't breathe.<br> I'm choking.<br> Bones! Shake him, break his concentration.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Scott on the Enterprise.<br> It's all right, captain.<br> The turbulence has abated.<br> Good, I think you'll find that the orbit lock is broken as well.<br> Assess damage and repair whatever's necessary.<br> Aye, captain.<br> I don't know how I can ever thank you, not only for Platonius, but for myself.<br> No thanks is necessary.<br> Alexander, show our guests to the south wing.<br> Thank you, we must return to the ship.<br> I think I'd better wait until the fever breaks.<br> Well, in that case, we'll stay.<br> Anything you want, just ask me, anything.<br> Thank you, Alexander.<br> Think nothing of it, you saved my life.<br> Listen, I think I should tell you that Tell me what? Well, just that I never knew any people like you existed.<br> Where is everyone? They're all in chambers, meditating.<br> Alexander, are there other Platonians like you? What do you mean, like me? Who don't have a psychokinetic ability.<br> I thought you were talking about my size.<br> Because they make fun of me for my size.<br> But to answer your question, I'm the only one who doesn't have it.<br> I was brought here as the court buffoon.<br> That's why I'm everybody's slave and I have to be ten places at once and I never do anything right.<br> How does one obtain the power? As far as I know, it just comes to you sometime after you're born.<br> They say I'm a throwback.<br> And I am, and so are you.<br> - Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.<br> - Don't worry.<br> We're happy without it.<br> You know, I believe you are.<br> Listen, where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power and my size? Alexander, where I come from, size, shape or colour makes no difference.<br> And nobody has the power.<br> Nobody? Somebody wants me.<br> Captain, it will be very gratifying to leave here.<br> That might not be easy should Parmen die.<br> - Even if he shouldn't.<br> - Yes.<br> This utopia of theirs is one of the best-kept secrets in the galaxy.<br> Screening themselves from our sensors, locking us into orbit.<br> All this adds up to a pattern.<br> Jim, my concoction actually worked, the fever's broken.<br> And what recuperative powers.<br> The infection's begun to drain already.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, you may yet cure the common cold.<br> If there ever was a time to get out of here, it's now.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Scotty, come in.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> - Prepare to beam us up.<br> I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.<br> Everything's frozen.<br> Turbulence hit you that hard? It's not the turbulence, sir, damage to the ship is minimal.<br> What caused it? I don't know, sir.<br> And those are the facts.<br> Did you get up into space? No, sir, the orbit has locked tighter than ever.<br> And subspace communication with Starfleet, that's completely severed.<br> All right, Scotty.<br> I'll handle it down here.<br> Stand by.<br> Great Pan sounds his horn Marking time to the rhyme With his hoof, with his hoof Forward, forward in our plan We proceed as we began - Your Excellency.<br> - \"Parmen\" will do.<br> Philosopher-kings have no need of titles.<br> I would like to know why the ship's instrumentation and weaponry is frozen.<br> And why the Enterprise is locked in orbit.<br> Captain, please.<br> You are mistaken, I assure you.<br> Parmen, I've talked to the engineer aboard the ship.<br> We've showed our good faith.<br> Now you show yours.<br> - I want the ship released immediately.<br> - The amenities, captain.<br> Allow me to remind you that I am the head of this principality.<br> Guests do not come barging in here making demands and issuing orders.<br> Guests? You don't know the meaning of the word.<br> Guests aren't treated like common prisoners.<br> Do not take that tone with me.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Acknowledge.<br> Acknowledge.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Enterprise I can't raise them.<br> Obviously, Parmen does not wish any contact made with the Enterprise.<br> Well, he may need our medical stores.<br> Why prevent contact? To shut out any knowledge of his brutal treatment of a Starfleet captain.<br> No, Mr.<br> Spock, one thing for certain.<br> Parmen is not concerned with my dignity or safety.<br> Agreed, captain.<br> And Parmen would not have treated you so brutally if he had any intention of releasing you or the Enterprise.<br> Where are you going? I don't know.<br> I don't want to go, but I can't help myself.<br> Gentle spacemen.<br> We are eternally in your debt.<br> We have some trifles for you.<br> Please accept them as tokens of our gratitude.<br> They stem from the very source of our inspiration.<br> To our noble captain, the shield carried by Pericles, as a symbol of gallant leadership.<br> To our silent and cerebral Mr.<br> Spock, this kithara to pluck music to soothe his ever-active brow.<br> And lastly, to the physician Dr.<br> McCoy who saved Platonius and my spouse, this ancient collection of Greek cures, penned by Hippocrates himself.<br> Has the Enterprise been released yet? Captain, wait.<br> I know what you're thinking.<br> My humble apologies, you were badly used.<br> In my own defence, allow me to say that my illness was more profoundly disturbing than I, myself, realised.<br> I am sure that you, too, have been out of sorts and have been driven to fits of temper and rage.<br> Unlike you, however, what I think and feel, whether for good or ill, is instantly translated into reality.<br> So, please, find it in your heart to forgive me.<br> Certainly.<br> Has the Enterprise been released yet? It will be shortly.<br> Then good day, and thank you for the presents.<br> Not at all.<br> But there is one final request.<br> After my nearly fatal infection, it has become obvious to us all that we cannot afford to be without a skilled physician.<br> Therefore, we should like you, Dr.<br> McCoy, to remain.<br> I'm very sorry, but that's impossible.<br> Your duties will be extraordinarily light.<br> Feel free to read, to meditate, to conduct research, whatever you like.<br> You will want for nothing.<br> The answer is no.<br> We should like to keep it cordial, but we are determined to have you stay, doctor.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy saved your life.<br> - I am losing patience, captain.<br> And you consider yourself a disciple of Plato? We manage live in peace and harmony.<br> Whose harmony? Yours? Plato wanted truth and beauty.<br> And above all, justice.<br> My dear Mr.<br> Spock, I admit that circumstances have forced us to make a few adaptations of Plato.<br> But ours is the most democratic society conceivable.<br> Anyone can, at any moment, be or do anything he wishes, even to becoming ruler of Platonius, if his mind is strong enough.<br> And if his mind isn't strong enough, he gets torn apart like Alexander? Come now, we are not children.<br> In your culture, justice is the will of the stronger.<br> It is forced upon people by means of weapons and fleets of spaceships.<br> Our justice is the will of the stronger mind, and I, for one, consider it a vast improvement.<br> We don't use our weapons for the kind brutality you practise.<br> Farewell, captain.<br> Come on, McCoy.<br> McCoy.<br> I can't move, Jim.<br> They're gonna keep me here no matter what.<br> - Leave, please.<br> - No, you're the doctor.<br> They don't want to force you.<br> They need your goodwill.<br> They're trying Captain, go while you still can.<br> We're not leaving until McCoy is released.<br> This is not the Enterprise.<br> You are not in command, captain.<br> Why even discuss it? Get rid of them.<br> Oh, no, my dear, that might offend the doctor.<br> You wish to stay? By all means.<br> You can help us celebrate our anniversary.<br> In the process, I hope we can persuade you to join our tiny republic.<br> - You won't persuade me.<br> - I think we will.<br> - I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum - Spacemen marching to a drum We slithe among the mimsy troves And gyre among the bororgroves You're not staying, McCoy, no matter what he tries to Being your slave what should I do but tend upon the hours and times of your desire? I have no precious time at all to spend, Nor service to do, till you Stop it! Don't do this to him, Parmen.<br> McCoy, no matter what he makes me say or do, the answer's no.<br> No, Parmen! Stop it! Well, doctor? I have my orders.<br> As you wish, doctor.<br> Is this your utopia? Your grand vision of the future? You don't even We have had enough of your moralizing.<br> And we've had too much of yours.<br> You'll never get me to stay.<br> You will be happy to stay.<br> It takes a little time, doctor, but you will be happy to stay.<br> He's a Vulcan! You can't force emotion out of him.<br> - You must be joking, doctor.<br> - You'll destroy him.<br> We can't let him die laughing, can we? I beg you Spock.<br> Spock.<br> Don't let them break you.<br> Hold on! Don't Parmen, they saved your life.<br> I'm ashamed to be a Platonian.<br> Ashamed! How can you let this go on? Can you do anything for him? There's no medicine that can help him.<br> He'll have to come through this himself.<br> I trust they did not injure you too much, captain.<br> My muscles are sore, that's all.<br> The humiliation must have been most difficult to bear.<br> I can understand.<br> The release of emotions, Mr.<br> Spock, is what keeps us healthy.<br> - Emotionally healthy, that is.<br> - That may be, doctor.<br> However, I have noted that the healthy release of emotion is frequently very unhealthy for those closest to you.<br> Which just goes to prove that there's no such thing as a perfect solution.<br> So it would seem.<br> - Captain.<br> - Yes, Spock.<br> Do you still feel anger toward Parmen? Great anger.<br> - And you, Dr.<br> McCoy? - Yes, Spock, and hatred.<br> Then you must release it, gentlemen, as I must master mine.<br> I might have seriously injured you, captain, even killed you.<br> They have evoked such great hatred in me, I cannot allow it to go further.<br> I must master it.<br> I must control.<br> Jim.<br> This is senseless.<br> I've thought it over.<br> I'm staying.<br> - You can't.<br> - Parmen has promised you'll be safe.<br> Promised? Parmen? He'd let us beam up to the Enterprise then plunge the ship back into the atmosphere.<br> But why? Why trick me? Because if he killed us outright, in front of you, you'd retaliate.<br> You're a doctor, you have the means.<br> Bones, I know you're trying to do the right thing, but if any one of us escaped, Parmen knows that Starfleet would never let this planet go unpunished.<br> Sacrifice yourself by agreeing to stay and you sign our death warrant.<br> He's right.<br> I should have warned you.<br> They were treating you the same way they treat me.<br> Just like me.<br> Only you fight them.<br> All the time, I thought it was me, my mind that couldn't even move a pebble.<br> They told me I was lucky they bothered to keep me around at all, and I believed them.<br> The arms and legs of everybody's whim.<br> Look down, don't meet their eyes.<br> Smile.<br> Smile.<br> These great people, they were gods to me.<br> But you showed me what they really are.<br> And now I know, don't you see, it's not me, it's not my size, it's them.<br> It's them.<br> Them! - Put it down.<br> - No, this is the best thing for - Put it down.<br> - No.<br> - Do what I say.<br> Alexander.<br> - I'm gonna I'm gonna cut them.<br> Parmen first, and they'll all get infected.<br> But this time, listen, whatever they say, don't save them.<br> Let them die.<br> - Give it to me.<br> - Let me give them a taste of what they gave me.<br> Please.<br> They're gonna kill you, anyway, you know that.<br> In that case, what's the point in you dying too, Alexander? Give it to me.<br> That's the first time anybody ever thought of my life before his own.<br> I should have told you when you first came that they were gonna kill you because I knew that, but I was afraid.<br> - I was afraid.<br> - It's all right.<br> It's all right, Alexander.<br> Listen, we haven't given up.<br> And there may be something you can do to help.<br> - Anything I can do, you just tell me.<br> - All right.<br> Did the Platonians always have this power? - No, not until we came to this planet.<br> - Alexander.<br> Is it possible for you to recall how long after you arrived here that their power began to develop? How could I forget that? It was exactly six months and 14 days after we got here that they started pushing me around.<br> Would you know how many months' supplies you brought with you? - Four, I think.<br> No, three.<br> - That's close enough, Alexander.<br> Fascinating.<br> Their power developed two or three months after they started eating the native foods.<br> That's right.<br> Then it is logical to assume that there is a connection between the psychokinetic power and the eating of the native foods.<br> Well, then, why wouldn't Alexander have the same power as the others? Perhaps his system cannot absorb the crucial element.<br> Bones, I think it'd be a good idea if you took a reading of Alexander's blood.<br> Not that I'm afraid or anything, but will it hurt much? You won't even know it happened.<br> You still have a tricorder reading of Parmen's blood, don't you? Of course, Parmen possesses the highest order of psychokinetic ability and Alexander the lowest, in the same environmental conditions.<br> The probabilities are that Alexander was born with some biochemical deficiency relative to Platonius.<br> I'll run both their blood samples through for a full comparative test in the tricorder.<br> And if our theory works out, we've got a weapon.<br> The one significant difference between Parmen's blood and Alexander's is the concentration of kironide broken down by pituitary hormone.<br> Kironide.<br> It's a high energy source.<br> That could be it.<br> The pituitary hormones confirm the hypothesis.<br> They also regulate body growth.<br> You mean, the same thing that kept me from having the power made me a dwarf? Yes.<br> It's also obvious why Parmen kept this little utopia a secret.<br> Anyone coming down here and remaining long enough would acquire the power.<br> Exactly.<br> McCoy, there must be a quick way of building up a concentration of kironide in our blood.<br> It'll takes some doing, but it's possible.<br> What are we waiting for? What is it, Bones? Well, even if the kironide reaches its desired effect, it still may not help us get out of here.<br> - Yes, there are 38 of them.<br> - The point is well taken.<br> However, the psychokinetic power is not additive.<br> If it were, considering the Platonians' hostile propensities, two or three of them would have combined forces centuries ago and deposed Parmen.<br> He's right.<br> You know, Parmen says that each one has his own separate power frequency.<br> Because before when they tried to combine their powers and use them together, it never worked.<br> - I'm ready.<br> - Let's not waste any time.<br> Give us double the concentration in Parmen's bloodstream.<br> The time factor concerns me.<br> It may take days or even weeks before there's enough build-up from the kironide to be of any benefit to us.<br> Yes.<br> What about Alexander? Since the kironide's broken down and injected directly into his bloodstream, it should work on him as well as us.<br> Better, in fact, because he's acclimated.<br> Oh, no.<br> No.<br> Not after what they've done to me.<br> Why not? You could conceivably take Parmen's place and run the whole planet.<br> You think that's what I want? To become one of them? Become my own enemy? Just lie around like a big blob of nothing and have things done for me? I want to move around for myself.<br> If I'm gonna laugh or cry, I wanna do it for myself.<br> You can keep your precious power.<br> All I ask is one thing.<br> If you do make it out of here, take me with you.<br> Just drop me anyplace where they never heard of kironide or Platonius.<br> Alexander.<br> Nurse.<br> Lieutenant Uhura.<br> I guess we weren't sufficiently entertaining.<br> Are we ever glad to see you.<br> We were forced in the transporter and beamed down.<br> It was like becoming someone's puppet.<br> I thought I was sleepwalking.<br> I mean, I couldn't stop myself.<br> Captain, what is it? What's going on? Spock, do you feel any effect of the kironide shot? I did experience a slight flush, captain.<br> So did I.<br> Let's try a simple test.<br> Concentrate on raising this plate of fruit.<br> Nothing.<br> Fellow academicians, a band of hardy vagabonds arrived on this barren, rough-hewn planet.<br> It was a desperate hardship, of back-breaking toil, and then a divine providence graced our genius and our dedication with the power of powers, and through it our every need instantly materialised.<br> We thereupon determined to form a Utopian Brotherhood.<br> This night is indeed a festive occasion, for tonight we welcome into that brotherhood its first new member.<br> Not yet, Parmen.<br> You have to convince the doctor first.<br> They'll never do it, Jim.<br> Doctor, please, you have destroyed the festive mood of the ladies.<br> We must recapture it at once.<br> I know.<br> What would be better than a serenade from the laughing spaceman? Take care, young ladies And value your wine Be watchful of young men In their velvet prime Deeply they'll swallow From your finest kegs Then swiftly be gone Leaving bitter dregs Bitter dregs With smiling words And tender touch Man offers little And asks for so much He loves In the breathless excitement of night Then leaves with your treasure In cold morning light In cold morning light Now let the revels begin.<br> How faithless and fickle.<br> Make up your minds.<br> I'm so ashamed.<br> Please, make them stop.<br> We have tried.<br> Please, please make them stop.<br> I haven't the power.<br> I'm deeply sorry.<br> We've failed you.<br> For so long I've wanted to be close to you.<br> Now all I want to do is crawl away and die.<br> Careful, Mr.<br> Spock, too much love is dangerous.<br> Remember, Cupid's arrow kills Vulcans.<br> I'm so frightened, captain.<br> I'm so very frightened.<br> That's the way they want you to feel.<br> It makes them think that they're alive.<br> I know it.<br> But I wish I could stop trembling.<br> Try not to think of them.<br> Try.<br> I'm thinking I'm thinking of all the times on the Enterprise when I was scared to death.<br> And I would see you so busy at your command, and I would hear your voice from all parts of the ship, and my fears would fade.<br> And now they're making me tremble.<br> But I'm not afraid.<br> I am not afraid.<br> Parmen, let's get on with it.<br> You are so impatient, my wife.<br> Observe the doctor and learn.<br> He's quite content to wait for the piÃÂ¨ce de rÃÂ©sistance.<br> You're half dead, all of you.<br> You've been dead for centuries.<br> We may disappear tomorrow, but at least we're living now.<br> And you can't stand that, can you? You're half crazy because there's nothing inside.<br> Nothing! And you have to torture us to convince yourselves you're superior.<br> Stop it, Parmen! Stop it! I'll do whatever you want me to do, I'll stay here and serve you, but stop it! Parmen.<br> Alexander again.<br> He likes to play with knives.<br> Very well, we shall indulge him.<br> Who did that? - I did.<br> - Impossible! Quite possible.<br> And logical.<br> - What is this? - What's going on? Platonians, listen to me.<br> The next one of you that tries any trick will get hurt.<br> Not only do we have your psychokinetic ability, but at twice your power level.<br> Not twice mine.<br> Captain, no! Captain.<br> I beg of you, I'll do anything you say.<br> I do not wish to die.<br> Captain? Do you hear me? Don't stop me.<br> Let me finish him off.<br> Do you want to be like him? Parmen, listen to me.<br> I could have had your power, but I didn't want it.<br> I could have had your place right now.<br> But the sight of you and your Academicians sickens me.<br> Despite your brains, you're the most contemptible things that ever lived in this universe.<br> Captain.<br> You knew that I intended to destroy both you and the Enterprise.<br> Yet you spared me.<br> To us, killing is murder, even for revenge.<br> But there will be other starships Well, there's no need for concern.<br> They'll be safe.<br> Of late I have begun to think that we have become bizarre and unproductive.<br> We are existing merely to nourish our own power, it's time for some fresh air.<br> We shall welcome your interstellar visits.<br> I don't believe you.<br> That would be highly uncharacteristic.<br> We must expect, Parmen, that the moment we leave here, your fear would be gone.<br> And you would again be as sadistic and as arrogant as your 2500 years have made you.<br> And just remember, we can recreate that power in a matter of hours.<br> So don't try anything.<br> Understood, captain.<br> And you're right, none of us can be trusted.<br> Uncontrolled, power will turn even saints into savages.<br> And we could all be counted upon to live down to our lowest impulses.<br> You're very good at making speeches, Parmen.<br> Just make sure that this one sinks in.<br> Now, move aside.<br> Alexander.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, prepare to beam us up.<br> I have a little surprise for you.<br> I'm bringing a visitor aboard.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tShip's log, stardate 5710.<br>5.<br> Lieutenant Commander Scott reporting.<br> While exploring an outer quadrant of the galaxy, the Enterprise received distress calls from an apparently uninhabited, incredibly beautiful city on the planet of Scalos.<br> Captain Kirk and a landing party have beamed down to investigate.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - What do your sensors read? - They register something, sir, but I'm blessed if I can figure out what it is.<br> - Specify.<br> - I can't get a fix on it.<br> Sensors don't pinpoint a location.<br> We may have a malfunction.<br> I'm about to check circuits, sir.<br> You do that.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, does the location of the distress call correspond with this area exactly? Yes, sir.<br> I am still receiving visual contact.<br> I can see them, but I can't see you.<br> Check coordinates.<br> Is it the same area? Coordinates correspond, captain.<br> Well, apart from the landing party, there's no one here.<br> There are no Scalosians.<br> The distress call is very strong, captain.<br> They are pleading for immediate assistance.<br> Check circuits for malfunctions.<br> Kirk out.<br> It must be a malfunction.<br> This is a barren world.<br> There's hardly any vegetation, no apparent animal life.<br> When we run analysis, we should have some explanation.<br> But there is an insect life.<br> - My tricorder doesn't register it.<br> - Registers in my ears.<br> - Nothing, Mr.<br> Spock? - Evidently a civilisation of high order.<br> Rating number 7 on the industrial scale, humanoid in appearance, according to the paintings.<br> An abundance of literature, which I shall have translated and processed.<br> Certain structures hold evidence of recent occupancy, while others are apparently long abandoned.<br> No sign of present life? Instrument readings indicate life forms, but of a highly unusual and intermittent nature.<br> They have no discernible form or location.<br> A most puzzling phenomenon, captain, I shall have to study it further.<br> Something was here.<br> We saw them on the screen.<br> Lieutenant Uhura is still getting a distress call.<br> - What happened? - Unknown at present, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I want you to run a survey.<br> A complete survey of the planet using all ship's available instruments.<br> Compton! What happened? I was looking at him.<br> I was looking right at him, then he just wasn't there.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, start a replay of the distress call.<br> Scotty, are the transporter controls functioning now? Aye, sir.<br> Is Mr.<br> Spock still down there? No, he's in Sickbay.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy's running a check on the landing party.<br> - What is it, lieutenant? - Malfunction, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, I would like - Captain, it corrected itself.<br> Captain, there's some trouble on the hangar deck.<br> The controls are frozen.<br> Have repair crews been assigned? - Yes, sir.<br> - The tape is ready, sir.<br> Play it.<br> To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help.<br> My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation.<br> Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area.<br> We have no explanation for what has been happening to us.<br> Our number is now five.<br> We were once a nation of 900,000.<br> Freeze it.<br> This city alone It is logical to assume that this distress call was prerecorded.<br> What we received was evidently a delayed taped message.<br> That would explain our continuing to receive it while our sensors picked up only the landing party, sir.<br> Yes, but the fact remains that when we beamed down, we couldn't find those people.<br> They were there, now they're not.<br> Nor is crewman Compton.<br> It would seem that some force or agent, only partially discernible to our instruments, may have been responsible.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, I want the ship on standby alert while we continue the investigation.<br> Sir, now I have readings that deflectors are inoperative.<br> The controls are frozen.<br> Scotty, assist.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, ever since we beamed up from Scalos, we've had a series of malfunctions.<br> I want an investigation and an explanation.<br> McCoy to Captain Kirk.<br> Captain's presence for examination is requested.<br> - Can't it wait, Bones? - Your orders, Jim.<br> You're the last one.<br> - What do you read so far? - Can we discuss it here? On my way.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you have the conn.<br> - What is it? - Tell the captain what you told me.<br> Something's going on, captain.<br> Somebody's opened all the medical-supply cabinets.<br> - Anything missing? - Just disordered.<br> As though someone had picked up everything and examined it.<br> Thank you.<br> Lie down, Jim.<br> Well, that fits in with other disturbances.<br> Bones, what did your readings show up on the other men? All perfectly normal.<br> Whatever happened to Compton down there apparently had no effect on anyone else.<br> Any of them report any unusual experience since beaming up? No, there's no mention of it.<br> - I'm not finished yet.<br> - Hold on.<br> Bones, could something be making me hallucinate? What do you mean? I mean that twice before, something touched me and there was nothing there.<br> And it's just happened again.<br> Could I be imagining it? Well, physically, there's nothing wrong with you.<br> But am I hallucinating? I'd say no.<br> Then we did beam something aboard.<br> Something has invaded the ship.<br> Kirk to Spock, come in.<br> Spock, come in.<br> Captain, I have a reading from Life Support Centre.<br> Spock, I can't hear you.<br> Check your circuits, is there a malfunction? Captain, intercom system is breaking down rapidly.<br> Lieutenant, shipwide order.<br> Use communicators instead of intercom.<br> Issue phasers to all crew members.<br> Spock, repeat.<br> I have a reading from Life Support Centre.<br> - Alien substances being introduced.<br> - Meet me there on the double.<br> - Spock? - It is a force field, captain, the nature of which I am not familiar with.<br> I'm getting readings of an alien presence similar to those obtained on the planet's surface, but they seem to have no exact location.<br> Phasers on stun.<br> Sweep the area.<br> It would seem, captain, that they intend to allow only the two of us to enter.<br> I should advise caution.<br> What is it? Unknown, captain, but it is evidently a device of alien origin.<br> Hooked into the life support.<br> Designed to affect it.<br> Life support is still operating.<br> I would say that the installation is incomplete.<br> Disconnect it.<br> Destroy it.<br> That was no force field.<br> Something shoved me back.<br> They're in here.<br> You.<br> What are you doing on my ship? Show yourselves.<br> It seems that we may look at it, captain, but that is all.<br> - A show of strength.<br> - Yes.<br> Evidently, they are convinced that we can do nothing to stop them, and they wish to impress upon us what they can do to us.<br> Have your readings been fed into the computer? - Affirmative - Read out.<br> Computer, analyse and reply.<br> Have we been invaded? Affirmative.<br> Nature and description of enemy forces.<br> - Data insufficient.<br> - Number of enemy forces.<br> - Data insufficient.<br> - Purpose of the invasion.<br> Immediate purpose: Seizure and control of Federation starship Enterprise and crew.<br> Data insufficient for determination of end purpose.<br> Is there a connection between this and Compton's disappearance? Data insufficient.<br> Are we, at present, capable of resisting? - Negative.<br> - Your recommendations? If incapable of resistance, negotiate for terms.<br> - We will not negotiate.<br> You concur? - Aye.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? - Your recommendations, captain? Yeoman.<br> Is that coffee available, or have those circuits been damaged as well? My recommendation? Make them take the next step.<br> Spock? Captain.<br> Would you mind explaining.<br>.<br>? Who are you? Deela.<br> The enemy.<br> - You're the enemy? - Yes.<br> You beamed me aboard yourself when you came up.<br> A ridiculously long process, but I've taken care of it.<br> - What have you done with my men? - Nothing.<br> Nothing? Mr.<br> Spock? Scotty.<br> This is nothing? There's really nothing wrong with them.<br> They are just as they have always been.<br> It's you who are different.<br> Lieutenant.<br> Sulu.<br> This is nothing? They cannot hear you, captain.<br> To their ears, you sound like an insect.<br> That's your description, captain.<br> Accurate, if unflattering.<br> Really, there is nothing wrong with them.<br> - What have you done? - Changed you.<br> You are like me now.<br> Your crew cannot see you, or any of us, because of the acceleration.<br> We move in the wink of an eye.<br> Oh, there is a scientific explanation for it, but all that really matters is that you can see me and talk to me, and we can go on from there.<br> Why? Because I like you.<br> Didn't you guess? Or are you so accustomed to being kissed by invisible women? Deela.<br> Is this why you sabotaged my ship? Oh, it has not been sabotaged, we We had to make some changes in it to adjust it to us.<br> - You said \"we.<br>\" - Yes, of course.<br> My chief scientist and his crew.<br> I am their queen.<br> You are going to be their king.<br> You'll enjoy living on Scalos.<br> What about my ship? My crew? Oh, in a few of their moments, they will realise that you've vanished.<br> They will look for you, but they will not find you.<br> You're accelerated far beyond their power to see.<br> So they'll go on without you.<br> Don't be so stubborn.<br> You cannot go back to them, ever.<br> Is it so dreadful a prospect? This won't kill you, but the stun effect is not very pleasant.<br> Oh, that won't work.<br> Well, you go ahead.<br> Try.<br> Point it right at me.<br> My reactions are much too fast for such a crude weapon.<br> And I am quite good at self-defence too.<br> This can be set for stun and destroy too, like yours.<br> Please, accept what has happened.<br> There is nothing you can do to change it.<br> If I agree to go with you, will you set this ship to rights, take out that device in the life-support system? Don't be so silly.<br> You'll feel better about it all in a little while.<br> It always happens this way.<br> They are very upset at first, then it wears off, then they learn to like it.<br> You will too.<br> He's on his way to you.<br> Be gentle with him.<br> Captain? Captain Kirk! He's gone.<br> Lieutenant, did you see what happened? He was sitting there, he'd just drunk his coffee and he set the cup down.<br> You see, it's still there.<br> And then he vanished.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, do you verify? - That's just the way it happened.<br> He was there, then all of a sudden he wasn't there.<br> - Captain Kirk, you've made it.<br> - Compton.<br> - Did they accelerate you? - Yes, sir.<br> They've hooked something into the life-support system.<br> They're in there.<br> We've gotta get rid of it.<br> - Let's go.<br> - I'm sorry, sir, entry's forbidden.<br> - By whose order? - The commander.<br> - You'll have to step back, please.<br> - I am your commander, Compton.<br> And I order you to let me in.<br> - I'm sorry, sir, you are no longer.<br> - Who is? Deela? Is that who you're working for? At first I refused, but then after a while I found that I couldn't help myself.<br> I met this girl.<br> She's one of them.<br> I've never known anyone like her.<br> She brought me aboard and I showed them the operation of the ship.<br> Bridge controls, life support.<br> She explained that they wanted to know.<br> I didn't understand at first, but I do now.<br> So will you, sir.<br> All right, Compton.<br> Stun.<br> You were ordered to stop him.<br> Why did you disobey? I tried to stop him.<br> You hurt him.<br> He was violent, had to be subdued.<br> He was my captain.<br> Cell damage.<br> Another will be secured for you.<br> I'm getting a trace reading similar to that on the planet.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu, did you drink your coffee? - Yes.<br> - Did anyone else? - I had some.<br> May I? Was it the coffee? Are we gonna go too, just like the captain? I cannot give you that answer until these have been analysed.<br> Well, by that time, it'll be too late.<br> I suggest we recall the captain's words: \"Make them take the next step.<br>\" It would seem they have taken it.<br> And we must determine effective countermeasures.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, you have the conn.<br> I shall be in the medical lab.<br> I hate what happens to them when they're damaged.<br> You're going to have to learn to control your temper, Rael.<br> I do not want that to happen to this one.<br> If they are so stubborn a species, perhaps they will last longer.<br> - It may be.<br> - I hope so.<br> They all go so soon.<br> I want to keep this one a long time.<br> He's pretty.<br> - He is inferior, Deela.<br> - I don't think so.<br> You cannot allow yourself to feel an attachment to such.<br> I can allow myself anything I want.<br> Oh, Rael, don't be like that.<br> Am I jealous of what you do? - I do my duty.<br> - So do I.<br> And sometimes I allow myself to enjoy it.<br> Hello.<br> What is that device doing on my ship? Deela will explain it.<br> I will tell you anything you want to know, and you'll approve of it.<br> Approve of it? We're your prisoners.<br> Hardly.<br> You're free to go anywhere you want to.<br> Go ahead, captain.<br> It is not yet completely linked to your support system, but it is in operating order.<br> Study it if you wish.<br> I suggest that you do not touch it.<br> He told you not to touch it.<br> Look at your hands.<br> They're almost frozen, aren't they? It will pass.<br> The unit has its own self-defence mechanism, as you see.<br> You should have heeded me.<br> In your struggle with Compton, some of his cells were damaged.<br> Those newly accelerated to our level are sensitive to cell damage.<br> They age very rapidly and die.<br> - He was so young.<br> - Was.<br> - This is what you have planned for us? - We all die.<br> Even on Scalos.<br> Why did you lie to him? He did not damage that one, you did.<br> Perhaps he will be less violent now.<br> I see no reason to make him feel any worse than he has to.<br> Why do you care what he feels? Rael, he's not one of us.<br> He's temporary.<br> Why, he's gone to the medical laboratory.<br> He's trying to communicate with the Vulcan.<br> The species is capable of much affection.<br> I have noted that.<br> I wonder if they will demonstrate it to us.<br> Oh, Rael, stop sulking.<br> Accept it.<br> We've had to accept it all our lives.<br> Don't make it worse.<br> Go back to work.<br> Kirk to Spock.<br> I have fed all the ascertainable facts into the computer banks Go ahead.<br> You won't accomplish anything, but it may be historically valuable.<br> Hyperacceleration is the key.<br> I have counted only five of them aboard, but they have taken over the ship, and we are under their control due to this acceleration.<br> They are able to speed others up to their level, as they did Compton and me.<br> Presumably, this is enslavement.<br> Those so treated exist at this accelerated level, becoming docile, eventually.<br> But when Damaged.<br> - Damaged, they age incredibly fast.<br> As though accelerated living Burns them out.<br> - Burns them out.<br> Compton was burned out.<br> The device attached to the life-support systems produces an extreme, numbing cold.<br> It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep freeze for purposes only the Scalosians know.<br> Quite correct.<br> The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.<br> I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.<br> The unit will be activated.<br> By the time they hear this, it will be too late.<br> You have remarkable reasoning powers, captain.<br> You were quite right in almost every assumption.<br> - Why are you doing this? - Do you really wanna know? In a little while, it won't matter to you at all.<br> You'll be quite happy about it.<br> Just as Compton was.<br> - I really wanna know.<br> - Oh, dear.<br> You are so stubborn.<br> It should be obvious to you that we're doing it because we have to.<br> A long time ago It is in our history.<br> - We used to be like you.<br> And our country was almost destroyed by volcanic eruptions.<br> The water was polluted, radiation was released.<br> That changed us.<br> It accelerated us.<br> Children died.<br> Most of the women found they could not have any more.<br> All of our men had become sterile.<br> So we had to mate outside our own people.<br> Whenever a spaceship came by, we sent out calls for help.<br> But accelerating them to our level burned them out.<br> Don't you see, captain? Do I have to go into every detail? We are going to take you down with us.<br> Perhaps one or two others of your crew.<br> We have to.<br> Oh, we'll be kind to you.<br> I wouldn't hurt you, certainly.<br> I do like you.<br> What about the rest of my crew? They will remain here in suspended animation.<br> Oh, it will do them no harm.<br> We are saving them for when we need them in the future.<br> You will not last forever.<br> You know that, captain.<br> Captain, we have the right to survive.<br> Not by killing others.<br> You would do exactly the same thing.<br> You came charging down into that life-support room the minute you knew there was trouble.<br> You would have killed my people if you could have.<br> You invaded my ship, threatened my crew.<br> - There is no difference.<br> - There is a difference! Your trouble is in you.<br> We did not ask for it.<br> We are not to blame.<br> We are handling it in the only way we know how.<br> The way our parents did and their parents before them.<br> Did they solve anything? Have you tried any other way? Deela, have your scientists disconnect, destroy that unit.<br> I promise you, we'll use every skill we have to help you.<br> We'll move you to another planet, if that's what you want.<br> We'll call in the most brilliant minds in our Federation to help.<br> - We'll do - We have tried other ways.<br> We have tried to make the transition to your level.<br> Some of us, that is.<br> Those who made the attempt died.<br> We are trapped, captain, just as you are trapped now.<br> I'm sorry for what's going to happen to you, but I cannot change it.<br> You cannot change me.<br> Go to the Transporter Room, Deela.<br> Signal me when you're there and beam down.<br> With the captain? Yes.<br> I'll activate our unit and follow you.<br> I'm setting it to allow enough time for all of us to get off the ship.<br> Please don't delay.<br> What makes you think I would do that? - The captain's gone.<br> - Go after him, Deela.<br> There's no question about it, Spock.<br> I want you to take a look at this.<br> The same substance that's in the captain's coffee is in the Scalosian water, and there's no trace of it in any of the other cups.<br> - Why did you run? - I panicked.<br> I don't believe that.<br> I'd like to leave before he activates the suspended-animation device.<br> We're in the Transporter Room, you can activate.<br> Beam him down at once.<br> Captain.<br> What have you done to the transporter, captain? It was working before.<br> Try it again.<br> - The transporter isn't working.<br> - What did he do to it? Nothing.<br> He didn't have time.<br> It must be a What do you call it? A malfunction.<br> You'd better not activate the unit yet.<br> What would you say it is, captain? The technicians reported a loss of power.<br> That must be it.<br> - The captain says his technicians - I heard him.<br> You expect me to believe him? I expect you to check into all possible causes.<br> If I had a suspicious nature, captain, I would say that you sabotaged the transporter to buy time.<br> Yes, of course.<br> I'm glad we're both innocents.<br> I despise devious people, don't you? Oh, I believe in honest relationships myself.<br> Nurse, programme the information and determine whether we can find counteragents.<br> Doctor, did you just hear.<br>.<br>? I've been hearing that whine ever since we beamed down to Scalos.<br> I know what it is.<br> We brought it with us from Scalos.<br> If you'll excuse me, doctor, I shall be on the Bridge.<br> Your quarters are quite like you, captain.<br> Austere and efficient, and in their own way, handsome.<br> A room should reflect its occupant.<br> Absolutely.<br> May I freshen up? All this rushing about has left me windblown.<br> I'm glad to see that you allow yourself some comforts.<br> Are you married, captain? No family? No attachments? I know.<br> You're married to your career, and you never look at another woman.<br> Well, if she's pretty enough, I'll look.<br> I wondered when you'd say something nice to me.<br> Am I more presentable now? A bit.<br> It was quite delightful kissing you when you couldn't see me.<br> - But now - But now No.<br> I wouldn't allow you to take that.<br> No matter how much we trust each other.<br> But I would have been disappointed if you hadn't tried.<br> Was I too crude? Just don't try it again.<br> You're far too vulnerable to skin damage.<br> All I have to do is scratch you.<br> Yes, I know.<br> The difference between us is that you will come around to our way of thinking sooner or later.<br> But it's better sooner than later.<br> Lieutenant, will you replay the Scalosian distress call on my viewer? Aye, sir.<br> To any and all space travellers passing within range of the planet Scalos, I send you an urgent appeal for help.<br> My comrades and I are the last surviving members of what was once a thriving civilisation.<br> - Compton! - What happened? I was looking at him.<br> I was looking right at him, then he just wasn't there.<br> Those of us who are left have taken shelter in this area.<br> We have no explanation for what has been happening to us.<br> Those of us left have taken shelter.<br> We have no explanation for what has been happening.<br> Our number is now five.<br> We were once a nation of 900,000, this city alone holding a total population of 113,477 citizens.<br> Our planet, Scalos, in which existed culturally enlightened populations, has attempted to survive this mysterious affliction, but to no avail There is an insect life.<br> My tricorder doesn't register it.<br> - My ears, registers in.<br> - This is a barren world.<br> Limited vegetation, no apparent animal life.<br> - McCoy to Spock.<br> - Spock here.<br> I found a tape in the computer down here.<br> And when I try to read it, all I get is a whine.<br> Bring it to the Bridge at once, doctor.<br> This device attached to the life-support systems produces an extreme, numbing cold.<br> It is my belief that they are turning the Enterprise into a gigantic deep freeze.<br> The unit has a protective shield which does not allow any physical contact.<br> I don't know how to destroy it, but its destruction is imperative.<br> The unit will be activated.<br> By the time they hear this, it will be too late.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, notify the rest of the crew.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Can we use phasers to cut through that wall, bypass the force field and get at that unit? Mr.<br> Scott, we cannot cope with them on our level.<br> Can we find some way of coping with them on theirs? That is a very logical suggestion.<br> Please stand by in the Transporter Room.<br> There's nothing wrong elsewhere, sir.<br> Sufficient energy for beaming down.<br> This is the only damage? Well, go get the others and bring them up here.<br> Deela? Deela.<br> Deela? Rael! Rael No.<br> Now, stop it.<br> - Did he damage you, captain? - No.<br> How very fortunate for you, Rael.<br> Don't you dare do anything like that again.<br> It's contemptible.<br> Then don't torment me.<br> You know how I feel.<br> I don't care what your feelings are.<br> I don't want to know that aspect of it.<br> What I do is necessary, and you have no right to question it.<br> Allow me the dignity of liking the man I select.<br> Is the transporter repaired? No.<br> I have more work to do.<br> Don't you think you'd better do it? He loves me.<br> I adored him when I was a child.<br> I suppose I still do.<br> I must say, you behaved better than he did.<br> - Yes, I hope so.<br> - What did you say? I said I hoped I behaved correctly.<br> And nothing bothers you now? Why are we here? Our leaving was delayed.<br> Don't you remember? - You damaged the transport.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> That was wrong of me.<br> Yes, it certainly was.<br> But we are going to Scalos? - Do you want to? - Oh, yes.<br> What about your crew? Aren't you worried about them? They'll be all right.<br> What's the matter? Nothing.<br> You've completely accepted the situation, haven't you? You even like it.<br> - Am I behaving incorrectly? - No.<br> I liked you better before.<br> Stubborn and irritating and independent.<br> - Like Rael.<br> - Those are undesirable qualities.<br> Maybe that's why I liked you so much.<br> Because you were like him.<br> Rael, you don't have to worry about the captain.<br> He's made the adjustment.<br> Finished.<br> Yes.<br> It counteracts the substance most effectively.<br> Most effectively under laboratory conditions.<br> But the question is, will it work in the human body? And the second question is, how do we get it to the captain? By drinking the Scalosian water.<br> But, Spock, you don't know what that'll do to you.<br> It is somewhat stimulating.<br> You seem to be moving very slowly, doctor.<br> Fascinating.<br> He's gone.<br> Just like Compton.<br> I've beamed the others down.<br> Is it repaired already? Why didn't you tell me? It would have been an intrusion.<br> Come up when you wish.<br> Signal me when you are ready.<br> - Where will you be? - In Life Support.<br> I have to activate our unit.<br> Rael, wait.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I know.<br> Well, come, captain.<br> It's time to leave your pretty ship.<br> The unit is activated, Deela.<br> Beam down at once.<br> You crew will be all right.<br> You said so yourself.<br> I'm sorry.<br> - He's broken away.<br> He's armed.<br> - I'm ready for him.<br> You are very clever, captain.<br> You tricked me.<br> I should have known that you would never adjust.<br> What shall we expect from you now? We could put you in suspended animation, until we determine what to do with you.<br> Your survival does not depend on that.<br> No, it doesn't.<br> What do you want us to do with you? Don't make a game of it, captain.<br> We've lost.<br> If I sent you back to Scalos, you'd undoubtedly play the same trick on the next spaceship that passed by.<br> There won't be any others.<br> You'll warn them.<br> Your Federation will quarantine the entire area.<br> Yes, I suppose it would.<br> And we will die and solve your problem that way.<br> And ours.<br> Now, what about your problem, captain? And your Vulcan friend? If you will devote yourself exclusively to the concerns of Scalos, madam, we shall be pleased to remain and take care of the Enterprise.<br> You could still find life on Scalos very pleasant.<br> And very brief.<br> It'll be just as brief here.<br> You cannot get back to your own level.<br> No answer, captain? Do I displease you so much? Oh, no.<br> I can think of nothing I'd rather do than stay with you.<br> Except staying alive.<br> Energize.<br> Goodbye, captain.<br> Well, Mr.<br> Spock, what have you got? Dr.<br> McCoy and I have synthesized a possible counteragent to the Scalosian water.<br> Regrettably, we did not have the opportunity to test it.<br> Let's test it.<br> Nothing's happening.<br> You do seem to be moving very slowly, captain.<br> Mister Spock? Captain Kirk! Where in the blazes did you come from? - Out of the nowhere, into the here.<br> - And Mr.<br> Spock, is he coming too? Scotty.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5710.<br>9.<br> Mr.<br> Spock has remained in accelerated time so that he might effect repairs to the ship more rapidly.<br> Somebody's repairing every console on the ship.<br> This panel is being re-circuited at an incredible speed.<br> I think we've located Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Lieutenant, are your circuits clearing? - Yes, sir.<br> - Cancel red alert, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Open all channels.<br> Captain to crew.<br> Repairs are now being effected by Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The ship will resume normal operations almost immediately.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> My compliments to your repair work and yourself.<br> Thank you, captain.<br> I found it an accelerating experience.<br> Yes.<br> No malfunctions anywhere? Lieutenant.<br> I'm sorry, sir, I touched the tape button accidentally.<br> I'll take it off.<br> That's no malfunction? No, sir.<br> Goodbye, Deela.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain's log, stardate 5121.<br>5, orbiting the second planet in the Minarian star system.<br> This star has long given evidence of entering a nova phase, and six months ago, a research station was established to make close-up studies of the star as its end approaches.<br> Minara is now entering a critical period and the Enterprise has been ordered to evacuate the station before the planet becomes uninhabitable.<br> Yet our attempts to contact the station's personnel have been, so far, unsuccessful.<br> Dust.<br> Apparently these instruments have not been recently used.<br> Record tape.<br> Maybe it'll tell us something about the personnel that lived here.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Come in, please.<br> - Kirk here.<br> What is it, Enterprise? - Scott here, sir.<br> Our instruments have picked up a gigantic solar flare with very high levels of cosmic rays accompanying it.<br> - How bad? - An enormous one.<br> Our sensors indicate the cosmic-ray concentration measures 3.<br>51 on the Ritter scale.<br> That'll play the very devil with the crew as well as the ship.<br> At that rate, it will take exactly 74.<br>1 solar hours - for the storm to pass.<br> - Get that ship out of here.<br> Stay at minimum distance for absolute safety.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> We'll beam you up in - Negative.<br> We're staying here.<br> The planet's atmosphere will protect us.<br> - Get that ship out of here, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Very well, sir.<br> Scott out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, what about that tape? Remember, captain, that what we see on this tape happened approximately three months ago.<br> I don't think I can stand another week in this godforsaken place.<br> In his hand are the deep places of the earth.<br> Psalm 95, verse 4.<br> Looks like he was listening.<br> Who's down there?! What happened to them? Where's that sound coming from? Spock, can you pinpoint it? Negative, captain.<br> It doesn't register.<br> Bones? Spock! Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Spock.<br> Bones.<br> Where are we? Exactly 121.<br>32 metres beneath the planet's surface, captain.<br> - How did we get here? - Residual energy readings indicate we were beamed here by a matter-energy scrambler similar to our own transporter mechanism.<br> - That's a nasty cut, Jim.<br> Does it hurt? - No.<br> Captain, picking up a life-form reading, bearing 42, mark 7.<br> - One of the missing scientists? - Negative.<br> Although humanoid, it is definitely not Homo sapiens.<br> - Identification? - Impossible.<br> I can make no exact identification other than it being humanoid.<br> Let's find out.<br> Phasers on stun.<br> Approaching the life form, captain.<br> - What is it? - Still undistinguishable.<br> Be careful.<br> Well, she seems harmless enough.<br> The sand bats of Manark IV appear to be inanimate rock crystals, doctor, until they attack.<br> We're not gonna hurt you.<br> Is this your home? Do you live here? What about it, Spock? Analysis.<br> From what we know of the specific gravity and other environmental factors of this planet, a life form such as hers could not evolve here.<br> Are you responsible for bringing us here? Don't be afraid.<br> Bones, what's wrong with her? She's a mute, Jim.<br> No vocal chords.<br> Not even vestigials.<br> And I don't think - it's a pathological condition.<br> - Explain.<br> Well, she appears to be perfectly healthy.<br> For the other, her lack of vocal chords could be physiologically normal for her species, whatever that is.<br> A race of mutes.<br> Like the civilisation on Gamma Vertis IV.<br> That's my observation, for whatever it's worth.<br> Without speech, how's she gonna be able to understand us? - Unless she's a telepath.<br> - An unlikely possibility, captain, since over 98 percent of the known telepathic species send thoughts as well as receive them.<br> She's made no attempt to contact our minds.<br> Well, we can't keep referring to her as \"she,\" as if she weren't here.<br> Do you have any ideas? Well, I don't know about you, but I'm gonna call her Gem.<br> Gem, doctor? Well, that's better than \"Hey, you.<br>\" I wanna know why we're here.<br> I wanna know what's going on.<br> And she knows.<br> - I'm Captain - We are aware of your identity, captain.<br> Who are you? Why did you bring us here? We are Vians.<br> Do not interfere.<br> - What do you intend to do with us? - Delay us no longer.<br> We come in Since you already know who we are, you must also know that we come in peace.<br> Our Prime Directive specifically prohibits us from any interference I can't seem to stand up.<br> Don't fight the force field.<br> There's something about it that upsets the body metabolism.<br> Not quite, doctor.<br> The field draws its energy from your bodies.<br> The more you resist, the stronger the force field becomes.<br> Sufficient.<br> Spock.<br> There must be an exit other than the one we just saw.<br> Correct, captain.<br> - Do you feel all right, Jim? - Don't worry about me.<br> They may have hurt her.<br> Did they hurt you? The pain is gone.<br> She touched my head and the pain is gone.<br> The wound is completely healed.<br> It fits, Jim.<br> She must be an empath.<br> Her nervous system is so sensitive, highly responsive, that she can actually feel our emotional and physical reactions.<br> - They become part of her.<br> - Thank you.<br> Captain.<br> In this direction, my tricorder is now picking up a substantial collection of objects.<br> - Details? - Electronically sophisticated devices.<br> I fail to understand why my tricorder previously gave no indication of them being out there.<br> Well, they're there now.<br> Let's go check them out.<br> Staying here alone could be dangerous.<br> Come with us.<br> Fascinating.<br> Look at this stuff.<br> Bones.<br> Spock, come here.<br> Jim, Spock.<br> You're on schedule.<br> Some further simple tests are necessary.<br> We've just seen the results of some of your tests.<br> I found our missing men.<br> Dead.<br> - Another one of your experiments? - You're wrong.<br> Their own imperfections killed them.<br> They were not fit subjects.<br> Come.<br> - Time is short.<br> - Yes.<br> Your time is running out.<br> This sun is about to nova.<br> When it does, it'll destroy you, this planet and this insane torture chamber.<br> Let's get out of here.<br> Readings indicate the passage to the surface lies in this direction.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Out of range.<br> Readings, Mr.<br> Spock? Research station six kilometres in that direction, captain.<br> Let's get there as fast as we can.<br> If the Enterprise has a search party, it'll be there.<br> Spock? Is it much further? Just ahead.<br> Hey, Jim, look.<br> Scotty and the search party.<br> - Scotty! - Scotty! Stay there! - Come on.<br> - We're coming! Keep going.<br> Their will to survive is great.<br> - They love life greatly, to struggle so.<br> - The prime ingredient.<br> Where did they go? I believe they were never actually present, doctor.<br> It was a mirage.<br> Where's Kirk? Jim.<br> What are you doing here? Where's Scotty? - Captain, it was a mirage.<br> - Captain Kirk.<br> We have decided that one specimen will be sufficient.<br> - You will come with us.<br> - What about the others? We have no interest in them.<br> They may go.<br> - Very well.<br> - You can't go back there.<br> You'll end up like the other two.<br> - Captain, I request permission to be - Denied.<br> But, captain You have your orders.<br> - What happened to my men? - They are safe.<br> One specimen.<br> You said one specimen.<br> What happened to my men? - Indeed.<br> The prime ingredient.<br> - Where are they? Tell me.<br> You said you'd let them go.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Will you give us an estimate into how much longer we'll have until those solar flares subside? Aye, sir.<br> Readings now indicate At the present rate of decrease, we'll have to wait at least 17 hours more - before we even attempt to enter orbit.<br> - Aye.<br> Well, as long as we're stuck out here, we might as well relax until the storm passes.<br> Storm's already lasted four hours longer than we've anticipated.<br> Do you suppose our landing party could be in any danger? That's not likely.<br> The planet's atmosphere will give them ample protection.<br> And if I know Captain Kirk, he'll be more worried about us than we are about him.<br> What is it you want to know? We seek no information as you mean.<br> Your civilisation is yet too immature to have knowledge of value to us.<br> You don't need any knowledge from us, yet you're willing to kill for it.<br> Is that what happened to Linke and Ozaba? We did not kill them.<br> Their own fears killed them.<br> Well, what did you expect from them? And what do you want from me? We've already observed the intensity of your passions and gauged your capacity to love others.<br> Now we want you to reveal to us your courage and strength of will.<br> Why? What is it you hope to prove? If my death is to have any meaning, at least tell me what I'm dying for.<br> If you live, you will have your answer.<br> Come on, Spock, the passageway was there before.<br> It's gotta be there.<br> Doctor, I'm unable to lock in on the previous readings.<br> I can find no exit out of here.<br> Captain.<br> Jim, what is it? What have they done to you? Help him! Don't be afraid to help him.<br> Jim.<br> You lie still.<br> I'll check her out right away.<br> - Will she live? - She seems fine now.<br> Can you explain what happened? Complete empathy.<br> She must be a totally functional empath.<br> Her nervous system actually connected to yours to counteract the worst of your symptoms.<br> And with her strength, she virtually sustained your body's physiological reactions.<br> But she weakened.<br> I could feel it.<br> Is her life in danger? Well, it's impossible to say yet, but supplying your body with life support did drain her.<br> Her withdrawal seemed to suggest the fear of death, doctor.<br> Only your urging her on caused her to continue.<br> Well, that's true.<br> Fear would naturally be a first reaction.<br> Perhaps she doesn't know our captain well enough yet to offer up her life for him.<br> Could the strain really have killed her? Well, yes.<br> However, I would assume that her instinct for self-preservation would take over to prevent it.<br> How do you feel? I'm tired.<br> Can you recall what happened, captain? I remember the laboratory and they wanted to know something.<br> - I can't remember.<br> - Take it easy.<br> - What's the matter with me? - You have all the symptoms of the bends.<br> Nitrogen bubbles in your blood cause the pain.<br> Now, how would one get the bends down here? You'll have to ask the Vians.<br> Will I live? Well, you could use some time in our decompression chamber, but otherwise, I'd say your recovery's just about miraculous.<br> I wish I could take the credit for it, but she did the work.<br> Captain, I noted that a light preceded you at the moment you were returned here from the Vians' laboratory.<br> Spock, why do you have to get so analytical at.<br>.<br>? No, he's right.<br> Continue.<br> I conclude that such a light is an energy-transfer point linking this device to the power source.<br> Can you tap into it? If I can determine the frequency at which this device operates, I might be able to cause it to function for us.<br> And get us out of here the same way they brought us in.<br> - I would say so.<br> - And I would say proceed.<br> You are called \"captain.<br>\" You are responsible for the lives of your crew.<br> - Is this correct? - It is.<br> We find it necessary to have the cooperation of one of your men in our efforts.<br> - We will not cooperate.<br> - When we resume our interrogations, you will decide which of your men we shall use.<br> It is essential.<br> There is an 87 percent chance that the doctor will die.<br> And while Commander Spock's life is not in danger, the possibility is 93 percent that he will suffer brain damage resulting in permanent insanity.<br> - How's it coming, Spock? - I do not know, captain.<br> I begin to understand its operating principles, but that is all.<br> Spock, it won't be too long before the Vians come back.<br> You'd better find out how that thing works soon.<br> Take it easy, Bones.<br> Men weren't intended to live this far underground.<br> - It's just not natural.<br> - And space travel is? Some men spend the majority of their lives in mines beneath the surface.<br> I'm a doctor, not a coal miner.<br> I've recorded my principles and theories on the tricorder, doctor.<br> Should the Vians return, there is sufficient data for you and the captain to complete the adjustments.<br> I'm not a mechanic.<br> I couldn't get that thing to work, no matter many notes you left.<br> Possibly not, but you and the captain together will be able to do so.<br> In any case, Spock, you are the logical one to leave with the captain.<br> The decision's mine.<br> If there are any decisions to be made, I'll make them.<br> If and when it becomes necessary.<br> - What is it? I don't need any - I'm still chief medical officer.<br> I'll tell you what you need and when you need it.<br> Would you rather have the bends? That's it.<br> Just lie down and relax.<br> How long will he be asleep, doctor? Between the emotional strain and that attack of bends, he's in pretty bad shape.<br> I'm not criticising your action, doctor.<br> On the contrary.<br> I'm quite grateful for it.<br> The captain will be spared the strain of making so difficult a decision.<br> You simplified the situation considerably.<br> How? While the captain is asleep, I am in command.<br> When the Vians return, I shall go with them.<br> - If I hadn't given him that shot.<br>.<br>? - Precisely.<br> The choice would have been the captain's.<br> Now it is mine.<br> Your action is highly unethical.<br> My decision stands.<br> Not this time, Spock.<br> The choice has been made.<br> You stay here with my friends.<br> They'll take care of you.<br> Do you understand? Come, then.<br> Doctor, please understand that if there was any other way to accomplish our purpose Get on with it.<br> Why did you let him do it? I was convinced in the same way you were, captain.<br> - By the good doctor's hypo.<br> - Anything? A most unusual device.<br> It is a control unit, but not a control mechanism.<br> - In fact, it is not a mechanical device.<br> - What exactly is it? This control is attuned to only one electrical pattern of energy: The pattern produced by the mental impulses of the person who possesses it.<br> It is activated solely by mental commands.<br> Can you adapt it, re-attune it, to fit our brain patterns? I shall attempt to do so.<br> However, it is not possible to adjust the control to fit more than one pattern at a time.<br> I am, of course, most familiar with my own pattern.<br> Therefore, with your permission, l Do whatever you have to do to make it work, Spock.<br> What disturbs me is why the Vians let us keep it.<br> Fascinating.<br> They must have known we were capable of comprehending this control and making use of it.<br> And that we would use it to escape.<br> The only logical assumption is that they wish to let us go.<br> And they keep McCoy.<br> That is evidently their intention, captain.<br> Somehow, you're the crux, the focal point of all this.<br> Even before we got here, she was a prisoner.<br> They didn't hurt her, they didn't even threaten her.<br> Indeed.<br> The facts would indicate that she is essential to their purpose.<br> Yes, there is a purpose, but what is it? Has all the pain and terror happened, or been made to happen, for you? Completed, captain.<br> The adjustments are delicate.<br> They may not survive more than even one use.<br> However, there should be sufficient energy to transfer us to the Enterprise.<br> - Will it take us to McCoy? - If you so desire.<br> The best defence is a strong offence, and I intend to start offending right now.<br> Aim for the lab.<br> Bones.<br> Spock.<br> Get him down.<br> His wrists.<br> His pulse is almost gone.<br> - How is he? - Severe heart damage.<br> Signs of congestion in both lungs.<br> Evidence of massive circulatory collapse.<br> Don't talk.<br> Don't speak.<br> Take it easy until we get you back to the ship.<br> - What is it? What's the matter? - He's dying, Jim.<br> We can make him comfortable, but that is all.<br> You don't know.<br> You're not a doctor.<br> I am.<br> Go on.<br> Internal injuries.<br> Bleeding in the chest and abdomen.<br> Haemorrhage of the spleen and liver.<br> - Seventy percent kidney failure.<br> - He's right, Jim.<br> Being a doctor has its drawbacks.<br> I always wondered why l Thanks.<br> How long? It could happen any time.<br> The correct medical phrase, eh, Spock? You've got a good bedside manner, Spock.<br> Can't we do something? I'm afraid not.<br> Gem might be able to help him the way she helped me.<br> But could his nearness to death also kill her? Uncertain, captain.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy's analysis of her reaction assumes that her instinct for self-preservation would prevent it.<br> - However, we cannot be positive.<br> - If she could just strengthen him and keep him from sinking further into death, we might be able to save him.<br> No interference will be permitted.<br> She can save his life.<br> Let us help her to go to him.<br> She must not be urged or forced to take action.<br> - All must proceed without interference.<br> - The purpose that brought us together What purpose can all this serve, except the fulfilment of some need of yours? We have but one need left in life, and that is to see the completion of the final moment of our test.<br> - Be patient.<br> - Patient? Our friend is dying.<br> Perhaps.<br> What purpose can be served by the death of our friend, except to bring you pleasure? Surely, beings as advanced as yourselves know that your star system will soon be extinct.<br> - Your sun will nova.<br> - We know.<br> Then you also know that the millions of inhabitants on its planets are doomed.<br> That is why we are here.<br> This arena of death that you've devised for your pleasure, - will it prevent this catastrophe? - No, it will not.<br> But it may save Gem's planet.<br> Of all the planets of Minara, we have the power to transport the inhabitants of only one to safety.<br> If Gem's planet is the one that will be saved, we must make certain, beyond any doubt whatsoever, they are worthy of survival.<br> How will the death of our friend serve this purpose? His death will not serve it.<br> But her willingness to give her life for him will.<br> - You were her teachers.<br> - We were? - What could she learn from us? - Your will to survive.<br> Your love of life.<br> Your passion to know.<br> They are recorded in her being.<br> Her planet will be fortunate.<br> Each of you was willing to give his life for the others.<br> We must now find out whether that instinct has been transmitted to Gem.<br> - Time grows short.<br> - You were correct, captain.<br> Everything that has occurred here has been caused to happen by them.<br> This has all been a great laboratory, and we have been the subjects of the test.<br> No.<br> We only created the circumstances.<br> That was necessary.<br> Your actions were spontaneous.<br> Everything that is truest and best in all species of beings has been revealed by you.<br> Those are the qualities that make a civilisation worthy to survive.<br> Behold.<br> That is most significant.<br> An instinct new to the essence of her being is generating.<br> Compassion for another is becoming part of her functioning life system.<br> She is afraid.<br> She's saving herself.<br> She does not yet have the instinct to save her people.<br> We have failed? No.<br> No, not yet.<br> Captain, Dr.<br> McCoy's life is not solely dependant on Gem.<br> The Vians, too, must be capable of saving his life.<br> - True.<br> - Then you cannot let him die.<br> His death is not important.<br> We must wait to see whether her instinct for self-sacrifice has become stronger than her instinct for self-preservation.<br> Don't touch me.<br> Stay away.<br> Jim.<br> Spock.<br> - Are you here? - Yes, Bones.<br> Don't let her touch me.<br> She'll die.<br> Jim.<br> I can't destroy life, even if it's to save my own.<br> I can't.<br> Now, you know that.<br> I can't let you do it.<br> Captain? - What is it? - The intensity of emotion is draining us and building up the force field.<br> - Yes, I know.<br> - It draws its energy from us, captain.<br> In spite of what we see, all emotion must be suppressed.<br> That might weaken the field.<br> I'll try.<br> Yes.<br> Spock.<br> You cannot use our powers to change what is happening.<br> - You must save the life of our friend.<br> - No.<br> We will not.<br> Her instinct must be developed to the fullest.<br> The test must be complete.<br> It is complete.<br> Gem has earned the right of survival for her planet.<br> She offered her life.<br> - To offer is not proof enough.<br> - If death is all you understand, here are four lives for you.<br> We will not leave our friend.<br> You've lost the capacity to feel the emotions you brought Gem here to experience.<br> You don't understand what it is to live.<br> Love and compassion are dead in you.<br> You're nothing but intellect.<br> Farewell.<br> Strange.<br> - What is puzzling you, captain? - I'm not puzzled, Mr.<br> Spock, I'm awed.<br> I'm with you, captain.<br> She awed me.<br> No, no.<br> I wasn't thinking of Gem, I was thinking of that fantastic element of chance that out in limitless space, we should come together with Gem.<br> Captain, the element of chance can virtually be eliminated by a civilisation as advanced as the Vians.<br> Not to dispute your computer, Mr.<br> Spock, but from what little you've told me, I'd say she was a pearl of great price.<br> What, Scott? Do you not know the story of the merchant? The merchant.<br> Who, when he found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.<br> Yes, she was all that.<br> But whether the Vians bought her or found her makes little difference.<br> She was of great value.<br> Well, personally, I find it fascinating that with all their scientific knowledge and advances, that it was good old-fashioned human emotion that they valued the most.<br> Perhaps the Vulcans should hear about this.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, can you be prevailed upon to bring them the news? Possibly, captain.<br> I shall certainly give the thought all the consideration it is due.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Ahead, warp factor 2.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Warp factor 2.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I am the first officer.<br> This is Captain James Kirk.<br> Your Glory, I am Petri.<br> In the name of my people You mission is known to us.<br> Captain Kirk, you have now permission to show us to our quarters.<br> Now, just a moment, there's gonna have to be - some kind of understanding - Captain, please.<br> My first officer, Mr.<br> Spock, will show you to your quarters.<br> - Ambassador, if I might speak to you.<br> - You have not been dismissed.<br> May I have your permission to go? - You are now dismissed.<br> - Why, thank you.<br> Ambassador.<br> Ambassador, I think it's time you told me what's going on.<br> That creature, Elaan, is to be the wife of our ruler.<br> To bring peace.<br> Our two warring planets now possess the capability of mutual destruction.<br> Some method of coexistence must be found.<br> - I see.<br> So we go back to Troyius.<br> - Yes.<br> But slowly, captain.<br> I will need time.<br> Before we reach there she must be taught civilised manners.<br> In her present condition, my people would never accept her.<br> - And you are to be her teacher? - Those are my orders.<br> I must ask you and your crew to respect, or at least tolerate, their arrogance.<br> - Friction must be kept at a minimum.<br> - Yes.<br> That I can understand.<br> Another thing you should understand, captain.<br> You have as much at stake as I have.<br> Your superiors have made the statement that failure of this mission would be as catastrophic for Federation planning as it would be for our two planets.<br> To gain peace at the price of accepting such a queen is no victory.<br> I will take her the official gifts I bear.<br> Perhaps that will soften her mood.<br> Chekov, lay in a course for Troyius.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, impulse drive, speed factor.<br>037.<br> - Impulse drive, captain? - Yes, that's correct, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Sublight factor.<br>037.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Captain, you'll not be using the warp drive? All the way on impulse? That will take a great deal of time.<br> Are you in a hurry, Mr.<br> Scott? No.<br> Captain, the Dohlman is dissatisfied with the quarters provided.<br> What's the matter with them, Mr.<br> Spock? I do not know, but all the Elasians seem most irrational.<br> I gave up my quarters because Yes, I appreciate your sacrifice, Lieutenant Uhura.<br> I'll talk to her myself.<br> Swine.<br> Take back your gifts.<br> Your Glory, these are your wedding slippers.<br> Your ruler cannot buy the favours of the Dohlman of Elas.<br> This is your wedding dress.<br> A gift from the bridegroom's mother.<br> I want nothing of his.<br> This is the most prized of royal jewels, for your lovely neck.<br> I would strangle if I was to put the gift of a Troyian dog around my neck.<br> Kryton, by whose permission did he enter? He came in answer to your summons.<br> I understand you're not happy with your quarters.<br> Quarters? Yes, not happy at all.<br> Am I a soft Troyian fawn to need pillows to sit on? And these ridiculous female trapping, they are an offence to my eyes.<br> My communications officer generously vacated the rooms, hoping you would find it satisfactory.<br> I do not find them so.<br> And I find him even less satisfactory.<br> Must my bitterness be compounded with that ridiculous ambassador aboard your ship? I explained to Her Glory that her council of nobles and the Troyius tribunal jointly agreed that I should instruct Make her acquainted with the customs and manners of our people.<br> Kryton, remove him.<br> And take that garbage with you.<br> He dares to suggest that I adopt the servile manners of his people.<br> Your Glory doesn't seem to be responding to instruction.<br> I will never forgive the council for putting me through this torture.<br> Were you responding to my demand for better quarters? There are none better.<br> I suggest you make do with these.<br> You suggest? There are no more available, but if that's the only way you can get gratification I'll arrange to have the whole room filled, from floor to ceiling, with breakable objects.<br> I will not be humiliated.<br> Then act in a civilised fashion.<br> I did not give you permission to leave.<br> I didn't ask for any.<br> Captain, I wish to contact my government.<br> I cannot fulfil my mission.<br> It would be an insult to our ruler to bring this incorrigible monster - as a bride.<br> - Ambassador.<br> Ambassador.<br> This is supposed to be a peaceful mission.<br> There cannot be peace between us.<br> We have deluded ourselves.<br> Captain, when I am near them I do not want peace.<br> I want to kill them.<br> You're as bad as she is.<br> It's not required that you like each other.<br> - Just do your job.<br> - Job? The job is impossible.<br> We cannot make peace with people we detest.<br> Stop trying to kill each other, then worry about being friendly.<br> - But if she won't listen to me - Then make her listen, ambassador.<br> Use a different approach.<br> Stop being so diplomatic.<br> She respects strength.<br> Go in strong.<br> At first it appeared to be a sensor ghost.<br> But I've run checks on all the instrumentation.<br> All the equipment is functioning perfectly.<br> Hydrogen-cloud reflection? None in this area.<br> Nothing that would account for it.<br> - The ghost appears intermittently.<br> - Speculation? None, captain.<br> Insufficient data.<br> It's not an instrument malfunction.<br> It's not a reflection from a natural phenomenon.<br> A spaceship? Engineering to Captain Kirk.<br> Kirk here.<br> Captain, I know what you said about showing respect, but must I have these persons fool around with my equipment? Hang on, Scotty.<br> Be pleasant no matter how much it hurts.<br> I'll be right down.<br> We're only running on impulse engines now.<br> Ordinarily, we use the warp engines exclusively.<br> Well, I suppose, lassie, that even our impulse engines must seem fast compared to your nuclear-propulsion units.<br> We're interested in how the ship is used in combat, not in what drives it.<br> Engines are for mechanics and menials.<br> Menials? Without engines there'd be no fighting or Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I wish you had told me that you wanted a tour of the Engineering Department.<br> Do we not have the freedom of this ship? We have granted your crew the permission not to kneel in our presence.<br> What else do you want? Courtesy.<br> Remember? Courtesy is not for inferiors.<br> Courtesy is for everyone around here.<br> And you'll find you won't be able to exist on Troyius without it.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, our chief engineer, has shown you his Engineering Department as a courtesy.<br> You respond by saying, \"Thank you.<br>\" Bridge to captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - That sensor ghost is moving closer.<br> On my way.<br> Lost contact now.<br> Captain, we had a momentary fix on the object, long enough to establish it was a spaceship.<br> - Whose? - No data yet.<br> Captain, distant bearing, sir.<br> Mark 73.<br>5.<br> Main screen, extreme magnification.<br> Our ghost has materialised.<br> A Klingon warship.<br> Any change, Mr.<br> Spock? Negative, captain.<br> The Klingon ship had simply moved into contact range.<br> She's pacing us, precisely matching our sublight speed and on a parallel course.<br> - Security to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> What is it? Disturbance in the Dohlman's quarters, sir.<br> On my way.<br> Captain, it's Ambassador Petri.<br> They refused to explain what's happening but Her Glory has not summoned you.<br> Kryton, remove that Troyian pig.<br> It was a deep wound, Jim.<br> He lost a lot of blood, but he'll recover.<br> If I recover, it will be no thanks to you, captain.<br> Yes, well, I said, \"Talk with her,\" not, \"Fight with her.<br>\" I should have known better than to talk to her unarmed.<br> But you forced me.<br> I hold you responsible for this.<br> Well, I've heard of reluctant brides, but this is ridiculous.<br> Captain Kirk, may I speak with you, sir? Yes, certainly.<br> A message just came in from Starfleet Command.<br> It was Class-A security, and scrambled.<br> - I put it through the decoder.<br> - What was it? The Federation high commissioner is on his way to Troyius to attend the royal wedding.<br> Ambassador, if Elasian women are that vicious, why are men so overwhelmingly attracted to them? I mean, what magic do they possess? It's not magic.<br> It's biochemical.<br> A man whose flesh is once touched by the tears of a woman of Elas has his heart enslaved forever.<br> Ambassador, there's an added complication.<br> The Federation high commissioner will be attending the wedding.<br> The fat will be in the fire when he learns the bride just tried to murder the groom's ambassador.<br> There will be no wedding.<br> I would not have our ruler marry that monster if the entire galaxy depended on it.<br> And I will have nothing further to do with you.<br> I'm not asking you to have anything to do with me.<br> Just do your job with her.<br> How long will it be before he's on his feet? Lt'll be a few days, a week at least, Jim.<br> Here you put me, captain.<br> Here I will stay.<br> I have nothing further to say to you.<br> So Ambassador Petri is going to recover.<br> That is too bad.<br> You have delivered your message, now you may go.<br> Nothing would please me more, Your Glory.<br> But your impetuous nature Your Troyian pig was here in my quarters without any permission, so I stabbed him.<br> Just to be Troyian is enough.<br> You Elasians pride yourself on being a warrior people.<br> You must understand discipline to be able to give and take orders.<br> Now, my orders are to take you to Troyius to be married and to see to it that you learn Troyian customs.<br> I despise Troyian.<br> Any contact with them makes me feel soiled.<br> It's been my experience that the prejudices people feel about each other disappear when they get to know each other.<br> It's not in my experience.<br> Well, we're still faced with the same problem.<br> Problem? Yes, the problem of your indoctrination to Troyian customs and manners.<br> - I have eliminated that problem.<br> - You've eliminated the teacher.<br> The problem still remains.<br> And how do we solve the problem? By giving you a new teacher.<br> - Tell me, what can you teach me? - Table manners, for one thing.<br> This is a plate.<br> It contains food.<br> This is a knife.<br> It cuts the food.<br> - This is a glass.<br> - Leave me.<br> Like it or not, you're gonna learn what you've been ordered to learn.<br> You will return me to Elas immediately.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - Everything I order is possible.<br> That's the first problem we're gonna work on.<br> Then we'll get you ready - to go to Troyius.<br> - I will not go to Troyius.<br> I will not be made into a Troyian, and I will not be humiliated.<br> And I will not be given to a green pig as a bribe to stop a war.<br> If you enjoy the privileges and prerogatives of being a Dohlman, then be worthy of them.<br> If you don't want the obligations that go along with the title, then give it up.<br> - Nobody speaks to me that way.<br> - That's another one of your problems.<br> Nobody's told you that you're an uncivilised savage.<br> A vicious child in a woman's body.<br> An arrogant monster.<br> That's no way to treat someone who's telling you the truth.<br> Tomorrow's lesson will be on courtesy.<br> Lieutenant, open up the hailing frequency, identify us, - and ask the Klingon his intentions.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain, no response from the Klingon vessel on any channel.<br> I see.<br> All right, lieutenant, monitor all frequencies.<br> Phaser crews, stand by.<br> Maintain Yellow Alert.<br> What are you doing? No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.<br> - Where's Kryton? - On business.<br> No one may enter the Dohlman's presence.<br> Will you tell Her Glory that Captain Kirk requests the honour of a visit? The Dohlman has promised that I will be whipped to death if I let Captain Kirk pass through that door.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> When they wake up, take them to security hold.<br> Captain, your analysis of the situation was flawless.<br> Anticipating that she would deny you admittance.<br> However, the logic by which you arrived at your conclusion escapes me.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the women on your planet are logical.<br> That's the only planet in this galaxy that could make that claim.<br> You dare touch a member of the royal family? Only in self-defence.<br> Now, are you gonna behave or not? The penalty is death for what you are doing.<br> We're not on Elas.<br> We're on my starship.<br> I command here.<br> You are warned, captain, never to touch me again.<br> If I touch you again, Your Glory, it'll be to administer an ancient Earth custom called a spanking.<br> A form of punishment administered to spoiled brats.<br> You have my leave to go.<br> You forget, Your Glory, we haven't started your lesson in courtesy.<br> You can teach me nothing, captain.<br> If I have to stay here for ten light-years, I will not be soiled by any contact with you.<br> Very well, I'll send in Mr.<br> Spock or Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> You're gonna be properly prepared for Troyius.<br> As ordered by councils, rulers and bureaucrats.<br> Captain.<br> - There's one thing you can teach me.<br> - No, you were right the first time.<br> There's nothing I can teach you.<br> There's nothing you do not know.<br> I don't know how to make people like me.<br> I don't want everybody to hate me.<br> Well, it's not that people hate you.<br> It's just that people don't like to be treated as though they don't exist.<br> It's gotten very Something must have gone wrong with the ventilation system.<br> - Captain? - Pardon me, Your Glory.<br> - There will be a short recess.<br> - Captain? Captain, that ancient Earth custom called spanking.<br> What is it? It's It's We'll talk about it later.<br> - Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Mr.<br> Spock - I have it on my sensor, lieutenant.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Come in, please.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> - Please answer.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Captain, I'm picking up transmission from inside the Enterprise.<br> It's on a tight beam aimed at the Klingon vessel.<br> Inside the Enterprise? Can you pinpoint it? Spock here, captain.<br> I am triangulating now.<br> It's coming from the Engineering section.<br> Security to Engineering, intruder alert.<br> Security alert to all decks.<br> Kirk out.<br> Nobody saw him, but the devil sneaked back in here some way.<br> Watson must have caught him and he was killed for it.<br> He had this.<br> Looks like some sort of transmitter.<br> - It's Klingon.<br> Bones? - Captain.<br> Neck snapped clean.<br> What kind of a signal did you send the Klingon ship? Captain, you must know I will tell you nothing.<br> Our interrogation techniques are more excruciating than you are even capable of.<br> Yes, I'm aware you're trained to resist any form of physical torture.<br> - Kirk to Spock.<br> - Spock here, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, it was Kryton transmitting.<br> He refuses to talk.<br> I'll need you for the Vulcan mind-meld.<br> Captain, I'm sorry, but he seemed What was he trying to cover that was so important he felt he had to die for it? Scotty, he didn't come into Engineering just to use the transmitter.<br> I want you to check every relay you've got.<br> Captain, you must realise the time Don't waste the time telling me about it.<br> Get to it.<br> Aye.<br> Kryton was of a noble family.<br> He loved me and wanted to marry me.<br> He was furious when he heard of the announcement of the wedding plans.<br> And he sold out to the Klingons because of jealousy? Probably.<br> But why speak of unimportant matters when we can speak about us? There's a Klingon warship out there.<br> What's their involvement? Surely all of this isn't because they want to stop a marriage.<br> We should welcome their help.<br> Elaan.<br> Elaan.<br> Two planets, an entire star system's stability depends on it.<br> We have a duty to forget what happened.<br> Could you do that? Could you give me to another man? My orders and yours say that you belong to another man.<br> What happened What happened was an accident.<br> It was no accident.<br> I chose you and you chose me.<br> I have a plan.<br> With this ship, you could completely obliterate Troyius.<br> Then there would be no need for the marriage.<br> And in gratitude, my people would give you the complete rule of this system.<br> What kind of a mind could think of such a thing? He's a Troyian.<br> Captain? You cannot resist my love, my love.<br> Captain.<br> May we see you a moment? Jim.<br> Jim.<br> May we please have a word with you? Captain, are you all right? - Did she cry, Jim? - What? Did she cry? Did her tears touch you at any time? We're in trouble.<br> Now listen, Jim.<br> Petri told Christine that the Elasian women have a sort of a biochemical substance in their tears that acts like a super love potion.<br> According to him, it doesn't wear off.<br> - It is true, then, captain? - It's true.<br> Bones, you've got to find me an antidote.<br> I'll try, but I'll need test of Bridge to captain.<br> Captain here.<br> Captain, the Klingon ship has changed course.<br> It is heading toward us at warp speed.<br> On my way.<br> Battle stations.<br> - Phasers stand by.<br> - Phasers ready, sir.<br> Their speed is better than warp 6, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, lay in a course to take us out of this star system.<br> If they wanna fight, let's get some manoeuvring room.<br> - Course computed, sir.<br> - Laid in, captain.<br> All right.<br> Ahead, warp factor 2.<br> - Captain, the matter-antimatter - Belay that order.<br> What is it, Scotty? The antimatter pods are rigged to blow up the moment we go into warp drive.<br> Scotty, that bomb he planted, can you dismantle it? Not without being blown halfway across the galaxy.<br> Give us every ounce of power you can from the impulse drive.<br> And find a solution to the bomb.<br> Kirk out.<br> Sulu, stand by to make your manoeuvres smartly.<br> - She'll be sluggish on response.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> One hundred thousand kilometres.<br> Ninety.<br> Eighty.<br> Phaser crews, stand by to fire on command.<br> Sixty.<br> - Ready.<br> - Fifty.<br> Hold your fire.<br> She's passed us without firing a shot.<br> I don't think they meant to attack us.<br> We were very fortunate this time.<br> Yes, their tactics are quite clear now, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> They were trying to make us cut in warp drive.<br> That way, we'd have blow ourselves up and solved their problem for them without risking war with the Federation.<br> Very neat.<br> Very.<br> But why do the Klingons consider the position of this system so vital? Yes, a very good question, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I have another question, captain.<br> Is not the Bridge the wrong place for the Dohlman, at a time like this? I'll be the judge of Yes.<br> You're quite right.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I want you to go to Sickbay.<br> It's the best-protected part of the ship.<br> I want to be by your side.<br> Your presence here is interfering with my efficiency, my ability to protect you.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you have the conn.<br> Deck 5.<br> I love you.<br> I have chosen you.<br> And still I don't understand why you didn't fight the Klingon.<br> If I can accomplish my mission by turning tail and running, I'll gladly do that.<br> And that mission is to take me to Troyius? Yes.<br> Would you have me wearing my wedding dress for another man and never see you again? Yes, Elaan.<br> Are you happy at the prospect? No.<br> Scott to captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - I've got bad news, captain.<br> The entire dilithium-crystal-converter assembly is fused.<br> No chance of repair.<br> It's completely unusable.<br> - No chance of restoring warp drive? - Not without dilithium crystals.<br> We can't even generate enough power to fire our weapons.<br> Kirk out.<br> My love, I have to go back to the Bridge.<br> Please, you must go to the Sickbay.<br> Yes, my love.<br> Test number 24.<br> Colladium trioxide in an algobarium solution.<br> - Results also negative.<br> - Doctor.<br> There is no antidote to the poison of Elasian tears.<br> The men of Elas have tried desperately for centuries to dispel its power.<br> - You're wasting your time, doctor.<br> - It is my time to waste, ambassador.<br> Doctor.<br> The captain asked me to come here for safety.<br> Safety? What is your estimate of our chances for survival, doctor? That is the captain's responsibility, ambassador.<br> Captain, message from the Klingon ship.<br> They are ordering us to stand by for boarding or be destroyed.<br> - They demand an immediate reply.<br> - They're trying to force a fight.<br> Scotty, what's our energy status? Ninety-three percent of impulse power, sir.<br> - We can still manoeuvre.<br> - Manoeuvre? Aye.<br> We can wallow like a garbage scow against a warp-driven starship.<br> Our shields will hold for a few passes, but without the matter-antimatter reactor, we've no chance.<br> Captain, can you not call Starfleet on this emergency? And let the Klingons know they succeeded in wiping out our warp engines? Help could not possibly arrive before the Enterprise would be destroyed.<br> Now that we are all about to die, I ask you once again to accept this necklace and to wear it as a token of respect for the desperate wishes of your people and mine, for peace.<br> That's all you men of other worlds can speak of, duty and responsibility.<br> We'll stall for time, proceed on course and hope the Klingons can be bluffed, or that they're not prepared for a general war.<br> - Open a hailing frequency.<br> - Frequency open, sir.<br> This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise, on Federation business.<br> Our mission is peaceful, but we're not prepared to accept any interference.<br> Enterprise, prepare to be boarded or destroyed.<br> I'd say our strategy wasn't totally effective.<br> Captain, the Klingon ship is closing on an intercept course, Deflector shields up.<br> Scotty, can you give me partial power on the phaser banks? - No, sir.<br> Not a chance.<br> - Three hundred thousand kilometres.<br> I told you to stay in Sickbay.<br> I want to die with you.<br> We're not going to die.<br> - Now, get off the Bridge.<br> - One hundred thousand kilometres.<br> It's passed us.<br> All shields held.<br> Sulu, bring her to 143, mark 2.<br> Keep our forward shields to him.<br> - Here he comes again, sir.<br> - Stay with the controls.<br> Keep our forward shields to him.<br> Better than warp 7.<br> Hard over, Sulu.<br> Bring her around, he's going for our flank.<br> - Sulu.<br> - Sorry, captain.<br> She won't respond fast enough on impulse.<br> He's passed us again.<br> Damage to number 4 shield.<br> How bad? It will not withstand another full charge, captain.<br> I'm getting some very peculiar energy readings.<br> He's paralleling us again.<br> He seems to have broken off the attack.<br> What sort of readings, Mr.<br> Spock? She is the source.<br> Elaan? The necklace.<br> - What kind of jewels are in this? - They call them radans.<br> The necklace is supposed to bring you luck.<br> It is of little value.<br> They are common stones.<br> These are common stones? See, captain? Here and here.<br> Common stones.<br> Now I see why the Klingons are interested in this system.<br> - May I have this? - If I can be of any help, of course.<br> You may have just saved our lives.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, do you think Scotty could make use of dilithium crystals? No doubt, captain.<br> He's coming in again, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, prepare on my order to turn quickly to port.<br> - Try and protect the number 4 shield.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Now, Sulu.<br> Hard to port.<br> Shields holding but weakened, sir.<br> Captain, message coming in.<br> Enterprise, our readings confirm your power extremely low, your shields buckling.<br> This is your last chance to surrender.<br> Captain, number 4 shield just collapsed.<br> Impulse power down to 31 percent.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, open a hailing frequency.<br> Channel open, sir.<br> This is Captain James Kirk of the United spaceship Enterprise.<br> May I request your terms for surrender? No terms.<br> Surrender must be unconditional and immediate.<br> Scotty, your estimate.<br> We're fitting it now, sir, but we'll have to run a few tests to make sure.<br> Test it in combat.<br> Captain, these are crude crystals.<br> There is no way to judge what the unusual shapes will do to the energy flow.<br> Aye.<br> They could blow us up just as effectively as Let me know when it's in place.<br> - Open a hailing frequency.<br> - Hailing frequency open, sir.<br> This is the Enterprise.<br> Will you guarantee the safety of our passenger, the Dohlman from Elas? No conditions.<br> Surrender immediately.<br> Captain, he's starting his run.<br> Scott to captain.<br> It's in place, sir.<br> But I can't answer for what happens.<br> You and Spock get up here.<br> - Sulu, prepare for warp manoeuvres.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Chekov, arm photon torpedoes.<br> - Photon torpedoes ready.<br> - Warp power to the shields, captain? - Negative.<br> His sensors will pick up our power increase.<br> The more helpless he thinks we are, the closer he'll come.<br> As he passes, I wanna cut in warp drive.<br> We'll pivot at warp 2 and bring all tubes to bear.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov, give him a full spread of photon torpedoes.<br> Aye, captain.<br> One hundred thousand kilometres.<br> Scotty, stand by to cut in warp drive.<br> Fluctuation.<br> It's the shape of the crystals.<br> I was afraid of that.<br> Seventy-five, 70, 60, - 50, - Fire at minimum range.<br> - 40, - She won't steady down.<br> Warp in, Scotty.<br> Full power to shields.<br> Warp factor 2.<br> Bring us to course 148, mark 3.<br> Chekov, photon torpedoes.<br> Fire.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Direct hit amidships, by photon torpedo.<br> Damage to Klingon number 3 shield.<br> Number 4 shield obliterated.<br> Loss of manoeuvring power.<br> He is badly damaged, captain.<br> Continuing away at reduced speed.<br> Secure from general quarters.<br> Well done, Mr.<br> Sulu, Scotty.<br> But I don't understand you.<br> You mean you won't pursue and finish him off? No.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, resume course for Troyius.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> You will not beam down for the ceremony? No.<br> I want you to have this as a personal memento.<br> I have learned that on Troyius they do not wear such things.<br> Remember me.<br> - I have no choice.<br> - Nor have I.<br> I have only responsibilities and obligations.<br> Goodbye.<br> Goodbye.<br> Energize.<br> It's stabilised now.<br> Spock, I've isolated the biochemical substance of the Elasian tears.<br> It's a kind of an infection, and I think I've found an antidote.<br> You're too late, doctor.<br> The captain has found his own antidote.<br> Are you out of your Vulcan mind? Do you know how long I've worked.<br>.<br>? The antidote to a woman of Elas, doctor, is a starship.<br> The Enterprise infected the captain long before the Dohlman did.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, prepare to take us out of orbit.<br> Well, I doubt seriously if there's any kind of an antidote for the Enterprise.<br> In this particular instance, doctor, I agree with you.<br> Ahead, warp factor 2.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I'm afraid I have.<br> A total of 15 incurably insane out of billions is not what I would call an excessive figure.<br> - Who is the new inmate? - Garth.<br> Garth of lzar, a former starship fleet captain.<br> When I was a cadet at the academy, his exploits were required reading.<br> He was one of my heroes.<br> - I'd like to see him, Donald.<br> - Of course.<br> Captain.<br> You're making a mistake.<br> Captain Kirk is pressed for time at the moment, Marta.<br> There's nothing the matter with me.<br> Can't you see just by looking at me? Can't you tell just by listening? She sounds rational enough, captain.<br> - I am rational.<br> - Well, what is it you want to tell me? I can't tell you in front of him.<br> You're afraid to talk in front of Governor Cory? He isn't really Governor Cory at all.<br> That's just it.<br> She's been saying that for days now.<br> Our medical staff can't figure out why.<br> Here's Garth.<br> He's been unusually disturbed, and we've had to impose additional restraint.<br> Cory? Yes, Jim.<br> I'm Cory.<br> It's true.<br> He tricked you.<br> You said you wanted to see me, captain.<br> Well, here I am.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Your Vulcan friend is still alive, captain.<br> My phaser was set to stun, not to kill.<br> He'll be quite comfortable.<br> Almost as comfortable as you and our esteemed governor.<br> Garth, do you have to make him suffer like that? You will address me by my proper title, Kirk.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I should've said \"Captain Garth.<br>\" I am Lord Garth, formerly of lzar, and I lead the future masters of the universe.<br> I'm sorry, Lord Garth.<br> You Earth people are a stiff-necked lot, aren't you? Release him.<br> I'm afraid that subjugating you won't be enough.<br> You must be confined.<br> And all the people of the galaxy who will not bow to my will must be confined or destroyed.<br> Captain Garth, listen to me.<br> Our beloved governor has decided to address us, and we have not given him our permission to speak.<br> Are you so afraid of him that you must keep him pinned? I'm afraid of no one.<br> You're all powerless against me.<br> Thank you.<br> Now, what have you done with the medicine? The medicine? You mean the poison.<br> I destroyed it - Destroyed it? It was your only hope.<br> - Silence! The chatter of inferior weaklings wearies me.<br> And it's time I took command of the Enterprise.<br> You will help me, of course.<br> - Of course.<br> - My crew mutinied.<br> The first use I will make of the Enterprise is to hunt them down and punish them for that.<br> The crew of the Enterprise will also mutiny.<br> But they won't.<br> You see, captain, there's a helpful technique I've mastered.<br> Goodbye, darling, I'll miss you.<br> Governor Cory, how do you feel? All right.<br> There is no help for any of us if that madman is in command of the Enterprise.<br> He boasts that he's created the most powerful explosive in the universe, and I believe him.<br> How does he manage to change form at will? The people of Antos taught him the techniques of cellular metamorphosis to restore the destroyed parts of his body.<br> And by himself, he later learned to use the technique to re-create himself into any form he wished.<br> The first time we knew about it was when a guard, seeing what he thought was me in Garth's cell, released him.<br> He was such a genius.<br> What a waste.<br> Forcefield is off.<br> Good.<br> Remain here out of sight until I give you the order to join me.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> Beam me aboard.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> - I said, beam me aboard.<br> - I said, queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> We have no time for chess problems.<br> Beam me aboard.<br> I'm following your orders, captain.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> Just testing.<br> Be in touch with you later.<br> No! No! No! I gave him the sign.<br> Why didn't he give me the countersign? Something's wrong.<br> Using the chess problem was the captain's own suggestion.<br> He couldn't have forgotten it, and I can't believe he was testing me.<br> Lieutenant, reestablish communication.<br> Aye, sir.<br> There's no response, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Send an armed detail to the Transporter Room immediately.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, what do your sensors show? We can't beam anybody down, sir.<br> The forcefield on the planet is in full operation and all forms of transport into the asylum dome are blocked off.<br> Well, we could blast our way through the field, but only at the risk of destroying the captain, Mr.<br> Spock, and any other living thing on Elba II.<br> How can we be powerful enough to wipe out a planet and still be so helpless? We are going to take the Enterprise.<br> Do you hear me? We are going to take her if I have to shatter every bone in Captain Kirk's body.<br> Captain? Captain Kirk? Well, I hope you haven't been too uncomfortable, captain.<br> I thank you for your concern.<br> All in all, it's been rather restful.<br> Good.<br> Still, I'm afraid I've been quite remiss in my duties as your host.<br> But I did invite you down to dinner, as you may recall.<br> - I'd forgotten.<br> - But I haven't.<br> You and Mr.<br> Spock are to be my guests.<br> - Where is Mr.<br> Spock? - Right here.<br> Marta! Why can't I blow off just one of his ears? Stop that, Marta.<br> Mr.<br> Spock will think we're lacking in hospitality.<br> Won't you join us, captain? - How are you, Mr.<br> Spock? - Very well indeed, thank you, captain.<br> Isn't Governor Cory joining us? No, the governor doesn't seem to be on the guest list.<br> An oversight? An intentional one.<br> The governor is fasting.<br> In that case, we must decline with thanks.<br> Captain.<br> Don't be a fool, Jim.<br> Go along with him.<br> Good advice, governor.<br> Well, captain? You'll find we set a handsome table, and the entertainment is most enjoyable.<br> You're very persuasive.<br> Yes, I am.<br> I certainly am.<br> Keep your hands off Kirk.<br> You treacherous thing.<br> - You're jealous.<br> - I am above that sort of thing.<br> The captain is annoyed by your attentions, that's all.<br> Am I annoying you, dearest? Not really.<br> He finds me fascinating, and you are bothered by it.<br> - Admit it.<br> - I may have you beaten to death.<br> No, you won't, because I am the most beautiful woman on this planet.<br> You're the only woman on this planet, you stupid cow.<br> Well, I'm the most beautiful woman in this galaxy.<br> - You're repulsive.<br> - I'm beautiful.<br> And I'm intelligent too.<br> I write poetry and I paint marvellous pictures.<br> And I am a wonderful dancer.<br> Lies, all lies! You're the greatest liar I have ever met.<br> Let me hear one poem you've written.<br> If you like.<br> If you could create a diversion, I might be able to find the control room and open the forcefield.<br> All we need is a few seconds if Scotty has alerted the security detail.<br> Gentlemen.<br> Courtesy for the performer.<br> Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And Summer's lease hath all - You wrote that? - Yesterday, as a matter of fact.<br> It was written by an earthman named Shakespeare a long time ago.<br> Which does not alter the fact that I wrote it again yesterday.<br> I think it's one of my best poems, don't you? I may kill you with my bare hands! Actually, captain, she is a superb dancer.<br> Marta, my dear, won't you dance for our guests? That was not a request.<br> Marvellous, isn't she, captain? Yes.<br> Incredible.<br> What is your reaction, Mr.<br> Spock? Well, I find it mildly interesting and somewhat nostalgic, if I understand the use of that word.<br> Nostalgic? Yes, it is somewhat reminiscent of the dances that Vulcan children do in nursery school.<br> Of course, the children are not so well-coordinated.<br> She's yours if you wish, captain.<br> Thank you, that's very magnanimous of you.<br> You'll find that I am magnanimous to my friends and merciless to my enemies.<br> And I want you, both of you, to be my friends.<br> On what precisely is our friendship to be based? Well, upon the firmest of foundations, Mr.<br> Spock: Enlightened self-interest.<br> You, captain, are second only to me as the finest military commander in the galaxy.<br> That's very flattering.<br> I am primarily an explorer now, Captain Garth.<br> And so have I been.<br> I have charted more new worlds than any man in history.<br> And tried to destroy Antos IV.<br> Why? Well, I could say because they were actively hostile to the Federation.<br> Yes, you could say, but that would be untrue.<br> Agreed.<br> Actually, they were quite harmless, and they made me whole when I was maimed and dying.<br> And in my gratitude, I offered them a galaxy.<br> But they rejected me and I condemned them to death.<br> How could you, a starship fleet captain, believe that a Federation crew would blindly obey your order to destroy the entire Antos race, a people famous for their benevolence and peaceful pursuits? That was my only miscalculation.<br> I had changed.<br> I had risen above this decadent weakness, which still has you in its command, by the way, captain.<br> My crew had not.<br> I couldn't sway them.<br> But my new crew, the men in this room, will obey my orders without question.<br> Gentlemen, you have eyes, but you cannot see.<br> Galaxies surround us, limitless vistas.<br> And yet the Federation would have us grub away like some ants on some somewhat-larger-than-usual anthill.<br> But I am not an insect.<br> I am master of the universe, and I must claim my domain.<br> I agree there was a time when war was necessary and you were our greatest warrior.<br> I studied your victory at Axanar when I was a cadet.<br> In fact, it's still required reading at the academy.<br> - As well it should be.<br> - Very well.<br> But my first visit to Axanar was as a new-fledged cadet on a peace mission.<br> Peace mission? Politicians and weaklings.<br> They were humanitarians and statesmen.<br> And they had a dream, a dream that became a reality and spread throughout the stars.<br> A dream that made Mr.<br> Spock and me brothers.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, do you consider Captain Kirk and yourself brothers? Captain Kirk speaks somewhat figuratively and with undue emotion.<br> However, what he says is logical, and I do, in fact, agree with it.<br> Blind.<br> Truly blind.<br> Captain Kirk is your commanding officer and you are his subordinate, and that is all.<br> Yet, Mr.<br> Spock, you are a worthy commander in your own right, and in my fleet, you will surely have a starship to command.<br> Please forgive me, but exactly where is your fleet? Out there, waiting for me.<br> They will flock to my cause, and for good reason.<br> Limitless power, limitless wealth, and solar systems ruled by the elite.<br> We, gentlemen, are that elite, and we must take what is rightfully ours from the decadent weaklings that now hold it.<br> - Captain Garth - Lord Garth.<br> As you wish.<br> At any rate, you must be aware of the fact that you are attempting to re-create the disaster which resulted in your becoming an inmate in this place.<br> I was betrayed and treated barbarically.<br> On the contrary, you were treated with justice and with compassion, which you've failed to show towards any of your intended victims.<br> Logically, therefore, one must assume Remove this animal! Won't you try some of this wine, captain? It has a robust, full-bodied flavour which I'm sure you'll find diverting.<br> No, thank you, I prefer to join Mr.<br> Spock.<br> And I prefer that you remain here.<br> Marta, my dear.<br> We found your little divertissement enchanting, didn't we, captain? But there's much, much more to come.<br> The entertainment has merely begun.<br> By the way, I assume you play chess.<br> - Occasionally.<br> - So do I.<br> How would you respond to queen to Queen's Level 3? I'm sure you're aware that there are an infinite number of countermoves.<br> I am interested in only one.<br> I can't for the life of me imagine which one.<br> \"For the life of me\" is a phrase well-chosen, captain.<br> It could literally come to that.<br> Dead, I am of no use to you.<br> But I could make you long for death, beg for death.<br> In the midnight of November When the Dead Man's Fair is nigh And the danger in the valley And the anger in the sky I wrote that this morning.<br> - Do you like it? - Yes, I think it's very good.<br> Tell him what he wants to know and we'll go away together.<br> I can't.<br> But you must.<br> I beg of you.<br> No, don't beg, Marta.<br> It's degrading.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3, captain.<br> You'll talk freely, and quite soon.<br> What you see before you, captain, is my latest invention.<br> Quite ordinary in appearance.<br> Almost primitive, wouldn't you say? Yes, I recognise it.<br> It's used for rehabilitation purposes.<br> It helped many men back to health.<br> Appearances can be deceiving.<br> Once, it was a part of the rehabilitation process and, as such, quite painless.<br> And, I might add, useless too.<br> It made men docile and of no use to me.<br> I've added certain refinements through the use of ultrasonic waves.<br> The chair is no longer painless.<br> Put the governor in it.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3, Captain Kirk? It is in fact exquisitely painful, as you will now see.<br> Interesting, isn't it? The pain is real and can be prolonged indefinitely because there is no actual destruction of tissue.<br> Stop it! Of course, captain.<br> You had but to ask.<br> Now, as you can see, he has not been harmed physically.<br> Yet the memory of the exquisite torment remains.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3, captain.<br> - No.<br> - Too bad.<br> Remove our distinguished governor.<br> Put Captain Kirk in the chair.<br> No, you mustn't do that.<br> You really are becoming offensive to me, my dear.<br> Don't make it necessary for me to put you in it.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3, Captain Kirk.<br> Please, stop it.<br> You want him, don't you? - Yes.<br> - Badly enough to join him? Listen to me, my Lord Garth.<br> I can get him to tell me what you want to know.<br> Might be interesting to have you try.<br> No breakthrough? No, Mr.<br> Scott, still no response from the planet.<br> Sensor readings? The forcefield is weakest on the far side of the planet.<br> We can send down a shuttlecraft carrying a team in environmental suits.<br> It won't work, Scotty.<br> They'd have to cover thousands of miles through a poisonous atmosphere before they'd ever reach the asylum.<br> Aye, you're right.<br> Even if they made it, they couldn't carry anything powerful enough to break through the asylum dome.<br> Only the ship herself could do that.<br> Probably kill Jim and Spock.<br> Doctor, they may already be dead.<br> Slowly, darling, slowly.<br> Rest.<br> Is this more of Garth's persuasion, Marta? I told him I'd discover your secret.<br> I lied.<br> I would have told him anything to save you from that torment.<br> - I believe you mean that.<br> - I do.<br> This is where I've longed to be.<br> I think I knew I loved you from the moment I first saw you.<br> Marta.<br> Marta, I can help you.<br> But I must get to the Enterprise to do that.<br> - That's not possible.<br> - Yes, it is.<br> It is.<br> If I can get to the control room and remove the forcefield, then Garth is finished.<br> - Garth is my leader.<br> - He will lead you to destruction.<br> He's already destroyed the medicine that could have helped you.<br> But there's more medicine aboard the ship.<br> I'll help you, but you must wait.<br> You do you see that, don't you? Soon your friend Spock will be here, and then - Spock? - At least I've arranged that much.<br> How did you manage that? A convincing lie told to a guard who finds me desirable.<br> Darling.<br> No, no, you mustn't stop me.<br> He's my lover and I have to kill him.<br> She seems to have worked out an infallible method for assuring permanent male fidelity.<br> - Interesting.<br> - I'm very glad to see you.<br> Thank you, captain.<br> We're now armed.<br> I presume we shall try to reach the control room.<br> Yes, you presume correctly.<br> - Forcefield is now off, captain.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, it's the captain.<br> Scott here, captain.<br> You had us worried.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, I want a fully armed security detail beamed down here on the double.<br> They're already in the Transporter Room, sir.<br> And have Dr.<br> McCoy prepare additional medicine as quickly as possible.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> Captain, I suggest you return to the ship at once.<br> Your safety is vital to the Enterprise.<br> Waiting for your order, captain.<br> I also request permission to remain here, in charge of the security team you beam down.<br> - Very well, Spock.<br> - Still waiting, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, the captain's life is in immediate danger.<br> Beam him aboard at once.<br> The security team will be entrusted to me.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> Repeat, queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> He's waiting for the proper reply, captain.<br> Give the countersign as ordered.<br> Scotty, Mr.<br> Spock will give the countersign.<br> Give him the countersign, captain.<br> Security detail, stand by to beam down.<br> Blast away, captain, if you can.<br> Do you think I'm fool enough to give you a charged phaser? What have you done with Spock? Where is he? I have done nothing with him as of yet, but I do have plans for him.<br> The Vulcan will die rather horribly, and his death will be on your conscience.<br> - Captain Garth - Lord Garth.<br> No, sir.<br> Captain Garth, starship fleet captain.<br> That's an honourable title.<br> And I was the greatest of them all, wasn't I? Yes, you were.<br> Yes.<br> - But you're a sick man now, sir.<br> - I have never been more healthy.<br> No.<br> No, think.<br> Think back to what you were, before the accident that sent you to Antos IV.<br> Try.<br> I can't remember.<br> It's almost as if I had died and was reborn.<br> No, l I can remember.<br> You were the finest student at the academy, the finest starship captain.<br> You were the prototype, the model for the rest of us.<br> Yes, I do remember that.<br> It was a great responsibility, but one I was proud to bear.<br> And you bore it well.<br> And the disease that changed you, it's not your fault.<br> And the terrible things you did since then, you're not truly responsible.<br> I don't wanna hear any more.<br> You're weak, and you're trying to drain me of my strength.<br> No, I'm not.<br> I want you to find what you once had.<br> I want you go back to the greatness that you've lost, Captain Garth.<br> I am Lord Garth, master of the universe.<br> You doubt me only because I have not as of yet had my coronation.<br> - No, sir, listen to me.<br> I can - Stop! - On your knees.<br> - No.<br> On your knees before me.<br> All the others before me have failed.<br> Alexander, Caesar, Napoleon, Hitler, Lee Kuan, Krotus.<br> All of them are dust.<br> But I will triumph.<br> I will make the ultimate conquest.<br> The throne must be higher.<br> It must be higher than anything else in this room.<br> Use that table as a pedestal.<br> Welcome back, Captain Kirk.<br> I'm glad you could make it for the coronation.<br> - Coronation? - Yes.<br> Oh, I know that even a real throne is no more than merely a chair, but the symbolism is important, don't you agree? Yes, I agree.<br> You'll wear a crown too, I presume? Well, again, just as a token.<br> Not impressive in itself, but it will serve as a standard around which our followers will rally.<br> Garth, you have only a handful of men.<br> You do refuse to enter into the spirit of the thing, don't you, captain? Perhaps you'd like a larger role in the ceremony.<br> You could serve as human sacrifice, for example.<br> No, I wouldn't enjoy that at all.<br> Besides, you seem to need me alive.<br> True.<br> All right.<br> How about crown prince? That would make you our heir apparent.<br> Heir apparent, I believe, is the proper role for you.<br> Besides, we have other candidates for our human sacrifice.<br> Who knows? We're ready.<br> Well, since there is no one mighty enough to perform this ceremony, we'll perform it ourselves.<br> Therefore, we hereby proclaim that I am Lord Garth, master of the universe.<br> And we designate our beloved Marta to be our consort.<br> And we further designate Captain James Kirk of the starship Enterprise to be our heir apparent.<br> Let us now remove our heir apparent so that we may conclude this ceremony.<br> Listen to me.<br> This may be our last chance.<br> Garth will destroy all of us unless you help me stop him.<br> And he's using you, you know, because he wants the power for himself.<br> I brought something here that might have cured you, but he destroyed it.<br> I can get a patrol down here.<br> They'd bring some more of that medicine down here Well done.<br> Well, captain, you continue to resist.<br> How stupid of you.<br> Put him in that chair, right here.<br> I've arranged a small entertainment.<br> I wouldn't want him to miss any of it.<br> Oh, captain, even you must admit that I'm a genius.<br> What you see here is my latest invention.<br> This is an explosive, the most powerful one in history.<br> If I were to drop this flask, the resulting explosion would vaporise this planet.<br> Now do you see why it is ridiculous for you to resist me, captain? Well, perhaps you require the demonstration I've arranged.<br> Watch closely.<br> Now, it is true that she is deadly as a poisonous serpent, but she is also a beautiful woman, and you have held her in your arms, captain.<br> I've ordered my men to drag her out of the protective dome.<br> And, of course, she would choke to death on the outside in a matter of minutes, but I've arranged a more merciful end for her, because after all, captain, she is my consort.<br> One tiny crystal implanted in her necklace.<br> A portion of this explosive no bigger than a grain of sand.<br> I propose to detonate it from here.<br> Oh, poor girl.<br> Poor, dear, suffering child.<br> I will help her now.<br> There's been an explosion on Elba II.<br> Point-nine-five.<br> - It must have wiped out everything.<br> - Immediate probe.<br> - Is the forcefield in place, Mr.<br> Sulu? - Yes, sir, solidly.<br> Life continues to exist on the planet.<br> We've gotta break through it somehow.<br> Doctor, I told you we couldn't do it without killing everyone in the asylum dome.<br> I know it, Scotty.<br> Well, there's one last thing we might try.<br> Perhaps the ship's phasers can cut through a section of the forcefield at its weakest point.<br> Where did you say that was located, Mr.<br> Sulu? On the far side of the planet, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Will it leave a margin of safety for the people below? - Yes, sir.<br> - Prepare to change orbital path.<br> Orbital coordinates released, sir.<br> Break synchronous orbit.<br> Come to course 14, mark 68.<br> Course 14, mark 68.<br> - Ship's phasers to narrow beam.<br> - Ship's phasers ready, sir.<br> - Let's punch a hole in it.<br> Full power.<br> Another blast, full power.<br> Forcefield's still holding, sir.<br> Here.<br> How are your nerves, Kirk? All I can say, Garth: If it happens to me, it happens to you.<br> You're an extraordinary fellow, Kirk.<br> Your stubbornness defies all logic.<br> Logic, there's the key.<br> Your friend Spock is a logical man.<br> A very logical man.<br> Go and bring the Vulcan here to me.<br> Spock is not only a more logical man than you, captain, he's a more intelligent one, I'm sure.<br> I shall establish a rapport with him.<br> Fascinating.<br> Your Vulcan friend is a very ingenious fellow.<br> This could be most amusing.<br> - That's Garth.<br> Stun him.<br> - Hold it, Spock.<br> That's Garth.<br> Look at me carefully, Spock.<br> - Can't you tell I'm your captain? - Queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> I won't answer that.<br> That's exactly what he wants to know.<br> Very clever, Garth.<br> That's exactly what I was gonna say.<br> What are you doing? Arranging to beam down a security team.<br> - Are there any objections? - Yes, they may walk into a trap.<br> That's right.<br> Garth can destroy us.<br> Fascinating.<br> What manoeuvre did we use to defeat the Romulan vessel near Tau Ceti? Very good, Spock.<br> The Cochrane deceleration.<br> Spock, you know the Cochrane deceleration's a classic battle manoeuvre.<br> Every starship captain knows that.<br> Agreed, captain.<br> Captains.<br> Gentlemen, whichever one of you is Captain Garth must at this moment be expending a great deal of energy to maintain the image of Captain Kirk.<br> That energy level cannot be maintained indefinitely, and I have time.<br> I'm your captain, Spock.<br> Can't you tell? Shoot.<br> Shoot! He's right, Spock, you must shoot.<br> But you must shoot both of us.<br> It's the only way to ensure the safety of the Enterprise.<br> Captain Kirk, I presume.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise here.<br> Queen to Queen's Level 3.<br> Queen to King's Level 1.<br> Will intramuscular injection be satisfactory? Intravenous is indicated unless circumstances make it impossible.<br> How long before it takes effect, Dr.<br> McCoy? Reversal of arterial and brain damage should begin almost immediately.<br> Captain Garth, I'm James Kirk.<br> I'm Mr.<br> Spock, science officer on a starship.<br> The starship Enterprise.<br> Starship? - Starship - Yes, sir, the Enterprise.<br> I'm the captain.<br> - Can I help you? - No, captain.<br> The medicine seems to be taking effect.<br> I can manage.<br> It's very encouraging.<br> Should I know you, sir? No, captain.<br> No.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Yes, captain? Tell me something.<br> Why was it so impossible to tell the difference between us? It was not impossible, captain.<br> Our presence here is proof of that.<br> Yes, and congratulations.<br> What took you so long? The interval of uncertainty was actually fairly brief, captain.<br> It only seemed long to you.<br> I was waiting for a victor in the hand-to-hand struggle, which I assumed would be Captain Garth.<br> Because of your depleted condition.<br> Failing a resolution to the struggle, I was forced to use other means to make my determination.<br> I see.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, letting yourself be hit on the head, and I presume you let yourself be hit on the head, is not exactly a method King Solomon would have approved.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, ready to beam up.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

That's what I've recorded, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Do we have any knowledge of a planet that could have produced such a race of beings? - Negative, captain.<br> - Bones, what do you make of it? Well, I can't give you any specific circumstance that will explain him.<br> Judging by looking at him, we know at the very least he is the result of a very dramatic conflict.<br> Spock? There is no theory, captain, from the basic work of Mendel to the most recent nucleotide studies, which would explain our captive.<br> All gradations of colour from black to brown to yellow to white are genetically predictable.<br> We must therefore conclude that this alien is that often unaccountable rarity, a mutation, one of a kind.<br> Yes, I would agree.<br> That's the case here.<br> - Your prognosis, doctor? - Well, I can't give you one, Jim.<br> I've never worked on anyone like him, or anything like him.<br> Yet you are pumping him full of your noxious potions as if he were a human.<br> When in doubt, the book prevails, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I've run tests.<br> Blood is blood, even when it's green like yours.<br> The organs are there.<br> They're rearranged to a degree, plus a few I've never seen before.<br> Now, I've enriched the oxygen content of his blood, and pumped in a strong stimulant.<br> And I must say his recuperative powers appear to be excellent.<br> With your permission, I shall do some further research and join you on the Bridge.<br> He's coming around, doctor.<br> Well.<br> Touch-and-go there for a minute, but you're out of danger now.<br> You're aboard the starship Enterprise.<br> I've heard of it.<br> It's in the United Fleet of Planets? Federation.<br> So is the shuttlecraft that you were flying in.<br> It was? Don't you usually know whose property you've stolen? I am not a thief.<br> Well, certainly no ordinary thief, considering what it is you appropriated.<br> You're being very loose with your accusations and drawing conclusions without any facts.<br> Well, I do know that you made off with a ship that didn't belong to you.<br> I do not make off with things.<br> My need gave me the right to use the ship.<br> Mark the word, sir.<br> The use of it.<br> You can try those technical evasions on Starfleet Command.<br> That's where you'll be facing your charges.<br> I'm grateful for your rescue.<br> Don't mention it.<br> We're pleased to have caught you.<br> Who are you? My name is Lokai.<br> Go on.<br> From the planet Cheron.<br> That's in the southernmost part of the galaxy, in an unchartered quarter.<br> What are you doing so far from home? You understand that when we complete our mission, we'll take you to starbase, where you'll face a very serious charge.<br> The charge is trifling.<br> I would have returned the ship as soon as l What? What were you going to do? You monotone humans are all alike.<br> First you condemn and then attack.<br> I will answer no more questions.<br> Well, however we view him, captain, he's certainly no ordinary specimen.<br> Well, Lokai, I don't know what's normal for you exactly, but if I had your readings, I would be the most incredible physical specimen of all time.<br> We've never encountered a being like you.<br> I'd like to know more about you and your planet.<br> - I'm very tired.<br> - And very evasive.<br> Or at least not fully responsive.<br> Now, then.<br> I insist.<br> I am extremely tired, made so by your vindictive cross examinations.<br> I will answer no more questions.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura here.<br> Notify Starbase 4 that we've recovered its shuttlecraft, and it will be returned along with its user as soon as we've completed our mission at Ariannus.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Bones, if you're satisfied that the mutation theory is applicable, I'll make a note of it in my report.<br> Unless we get more information from him, it'll have to serve.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Captain, contact with alien ship, sir.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Notify Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Put the ship on the viewing screen, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Magnification.<br> - Still nothing, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - I verify, sir.<br> It's out there.<br> Maximum magnification.<br> I draw a blank, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your response? Negative, captain.<br> No malfunction, sir.<br> The reading persists.<br> - What is it? - There is a vessel out there, captain.<br> Could it be a Romulan ship using their cloaking device? Negative.<br> This would not be a Romulan vessel.<br> It is totally alien in configuration.<br> Motive power unknown.<br> The small size of the craft indicates a rapid scout vessel, one or two-man crew.<br> Captain, I've tried all hailing frequencies.<br> Negative, sir.<br> - Weaponry on the vessel, Spock? - Nothing identifiable.<br> The craft appears to be built for speed rather than combat.<br> Something out there can't be seen.<br> Explanation? None.<br> Completely elusive.<br> In fact, it's invisible.<br> Invisible.<br> Malfunction? There is no sensor failure.<br> The readings persist.<br> It's headed straight for us.<br> Evasive action.<br> It shifts with us, sir, and we're pushing to the limit.<br> - Deflector shields activated, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Automatic, sir.<br> We're on collision course.<br> It's out of control or a suicide mission.<br> Sound warning for collision.<br> Red Alert.<br> Brace yourself for collision.<br> Brace yourself.<br> Readout, Mr.<br> Spock? It just disintegrated.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - What is it now? It is gone now, captain, but it seems to have deposited an alien presence.<br> Where? Right here, captain.<br> Explain, Spock.<br> One of a kind? - I am Bele.<br> - Of the planet Cheron, no doubt.<br> Forgive my unorthodox arrival.<br> Your mode of travel was also unorthodox.<br> Secure from Red Alert.<br> What happened to your vehicle? It served me long and durably.<br> Unfortunately, the strain of arduous pursuit has exceeded even its advanced qualities.<br> I was just able to complete this trip and disembark in time, or I would have disintegrated in space with it.<br> A most unique craft.<br> Pity it couldn't be salvaged for our study.<br> Yes, it was sheathed in special materials that rendered it invisible.<br> What brings you to us? You bear precious cargo.<br> Lokai.<br> He has taken refuge aboard this ship.<br> I am here to claim him.<br> All personnel aboard this vessel are subject to my command.<br> No one claims anyone without due process.<br> My apologies, captain.<br> I overstepped my powers.<br> Claim is undoubtedly an unfortunate word.<br> What is your authorisation? From what source? I am chief officer of the commission on political traitors.<br> Lokai was tried and convicted of treason, but had escaped.<br> - May I see him, please? - He's in Sickbay.<br> Remember, since you're aboard the Enterprise, you're bound by its regulations.<br> With your permission, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Well, Lokai, it's a pleasure to see you again.<br> This time I'm sure our joining will be of a more permanent nature.<br> You are to be congratulated.<br> Never before has Lokai been rendered so quiescent.<br> I will not return to Cheron with him to a land of murdering oppressors.<br> I told you where you were going.<br> I allowed your fellow countryman here simply as a courtesy.<br> And you see how this killer repays you, as he repays all his benefactors.<br> Benefactors? He's a liar.<br> He raided our homes, tore us from our families, herded us together like cattle, and then sold us as slaves.<br> They were savages, captain.<br> We took them into our hearts, our homes.<br> We educated them.<br> Yes, just education enough to serve the master race.<br> You were the product of our love, and you repaid us with murder.<br> Why should a slave show mercy to the enslaver? Slaves? That was changed thousands of years ago.<br> - You were freed.<br> - Freed.<br> Were we free to be men? Free to be husbands and fathers? Free to live our lives in equality and dignity? Yes, you were free, if you knew how to use your freedom.<br> You weren't free enough to slaughter and to burn all the things that had been built.<br> I tried to break the chains of a hundred million people.<br> My only crime is that I failed.<br> To that, I do plead guilty.<br> There is an order in things.<br> He asked for utopia in a day.<br> - It can't be done.<br> - Not in a day.<br> And not in ten times 10,000 years by your thinking.<br> To you, we are a loathsome breed who will never be ready.<br> Genocide for my people is the plan for your utopia.<br> You insane, filthy, little plotter of ruin.<br> You vicious subverter of every decent thought.<br> You're coming back to pay for your crimes.<br> I know you and all those with whom you are plotting to take power permanently.<br> When I return to Cheron, you will understand what power is.<br> I will have armies of followers.<br> It is now very clear that you know each other extremely well, gentlemen.<br> The only service this ship can offer is to bring you together.<br> It is not a battlefield.<br> Captain, I led revolutionaries, not criminals.<br> I demand political asylum.<br> This ship is a sanctuary.<br> I'll tell you once more.<br> For you, this ship is a prison.<br> Captain, it is imperative that you return Lokai to Cheron for judgement.<br> Commissioner, Cheron is not a member of the Federation.<br> No treaties have ever been signed.<br> Your demand for possession of this prisoner cannot be honoured.<br> There are no extradition procedures to allow it.<br> Is that clear, Commissioner Bele? Captain, I hope you will be sensible.<br> - How do you mean? - Cooperation.<br> I cannot take sides.<br> Since I am without a vessel to return to Cheron, I insist that you take us there immediately.<br> Impossible.<br> I have a mission.<br> There's a planet to be decontaminated.<br> Millions of lives are at stake.<br> Once that has been completed, I'll return to Starbase 4 and turn you both over to the authorities.<br> You can make your case to them.<br> I am sorry, captain.<br> That will not be satisfactory.<br> Not at all satisfactory.<br> Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary from a far planet, I offer you every hospitality aboard this ship.<br> - Choose any other course.<br> - You're the captain.<br> Yes, I am.<br> I think we can consider your problem settled.<br> At least for the present.<br> I have ordered guest quarters for you on Deck 6.<br> I suggest you get a great deal of rest, especially your vocal chords.<br> It seems you'll have a double opportunity to practise your oratory on Starbase 4.<br> Chekov to Captain Kirk.<br> Chekov to Captain Kirk.<br> Urgent.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Captain, we're off course.<br> - Well, get back on course.<br> - That's just it, sir.<br> The ship's taken a new heading all by itself.<br> I'll be right there.<br> - Have you located the malfunction? - No, sir.<br> The ship is unresponsive.<br> We're moving away from Ariannus.<br> Explanation, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Elusive, captain.<br> I am investigating.<br> I can't understand it.<br> I simply have no control.<br> - Kirk to Engineering.<br> - Scott here.<br> Scotty, we're suddenly off course.<br> - Check out manoeuvring controls.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Hold.<br> Captain, no malfunction indicated.<br> Switch to auxiliary.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Out.<br> - Engineer to Bridge.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - On auxiliary, sir.<br> - Stand by for check.<br> - Scotty, we're still off course.<br> - I'll be right up.<br> - Speed, Mr.<br> Chekov? - We're moving at warp 8.<br> - And new course? - Four-oh-three, mark 7.<br> Straight for the Coalsack if there is no letup.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, put the ship on Red Alert.<br> All hands, this is the captain.<br> The ship is on Red Alert.<br> The ship is on Red Alert.<br> There has been an unidentified malfunction in the ship's directional control.<br> Repeat.<br> The ship is off course and out of our control.<br> - Our new heading, Mr.<br> Chekov? - Four-oh-three, mark 7.<br> - Spock? - Confirmed, captain.<br> Holding pattern.<br> Coordinates now indicate we are charting course to Captain, Cheron lies between 403, mark 7 and mark 9.<br> We are on the way to Cheron.<br> Captain, this ship is now under my direction.<br> For 50,000 of your terrestrial years, I have been pursuing Lokai through the galaxy.<br> I have not travelled this far, this long only to give him up now.<br> This ship goes where my will drives it.<br> Captain, we are now at warp 10, and the speed is increasing.<br> Captain, course is now clearly straight for Cheron, despite all efforts to direct us to Ariannus.<br> I will not return to Cheron.<br> Captain, you must guarantee me sanctuary.<br> He cannot help you now.<br> You are lost, Lokai.<br> You are on the way to judgement, to final punishment.<br> - Stop him.<br> - Not this time, you evil mound of filth.<br> Not this time.<br> My cause is just.<br> You must help me.<br> All of you must help me.<br> Oh, the old cry.<br> Pity me.<br> Pity me.<br> Everywhere he's gone, he's been helped to escape.<br> On every planet, he has found fools who bleed for him and shed tears for the oppressed one.<br> But there is no escape for you on this ship.<br> - This is your last sanctuary.<br> - Kill him.<br> Kill him.<br> - You're two of a kind.<br> - And we are both going to Cheron.<br> You cannot change the course of this ship any more than you can change me.<br> This ship goes where I want it to go.<br> Security, put them both in the brig.<br> Phasers on stun.<br> Fire.<br> Your phasers are ineffective against our shields.<br> You are helpless, captain.<br> What a fool I am, expecting help from someone like you.<br> This ship is going to Ariannus.<br> No, this ship is going to Cheron.<br> I will let nothing interfere.<br> We are going to Ariannus.<br> The lives of a billion people make no other choice possible.<br> You are being obtuse, captain.<br> I am permitting no choice.<br> My will now controls this, and nothing can break it.<br> Bele.<br> I am captain of this ship, and it will follow whatever course I set for it or I will order its destruction.<br> You're bluffing.<br> I will destroy it.<br> You can no more destroy this ship than I can change colour.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the Bridge to the master computer.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Computer, destruct sequence.<br> Are you ready to copy? Working.<br> Prepare to verify destruct sequence code 1.<br> Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.<br> Destruct sequence 1, code 1-1 A.<br> Voice and code 1- 1 A verified and correct.<br> Sequence 1 complete.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> This is Commander Spock, science officer.<br> Destruct sequence number 2, code 1-1 A-2B.<br> Voice and code verified and correct.<br> Sequence 2 complete.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> This is Lieutenant Commander Scott, chief engineering officer of the USS Enterprise.<br> Destruct sequence number 3.<br> Code 1 B-2B-3.<br> Voice and code 1 B-2B-3 verified and correct.<br> Destruct sequence completed and engaged.<br> Awaiting final code for 30-second countdown.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, has the ship returned to the course set for it by my orders? Negative, captain.<br> We are still headed directly for Cheron.<br> Destruct sequence engaged.<br> Awaiting final code for 30-second countdown.<br> Computer, this is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.<br> Begin 30-second countdown.<br> Code 000.<br> Destruct 0.<br> Thirty seconds, Twenty-five seconds.<br> Let's see you prevent the computer from fulfilling my commands.<br> Twenty seconds.<br> From five to zero, no command in the universe can prevent the computer from fulfilling its destruct order.<br> Fifteen seconds.<br> You can use your will to drag this ship to Cheron, but I command the computer.<br> Mine is the final command.<br> Ten, nine, eight, seven, six - I agree! - Computer.<br> This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.<br> Code 123 continuity.<br> Abort destruct order.<br> Repeat.<br> Code 123 continuity.<br> Abort destruct order.<br> Destruct order aborted.<br> Destruct order aborted.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, is this ship headed for Ariannus? Negative, captain, the Enterprise is now moving in a circular course.<br> And at warp 10, we're going nowhere mighty fast.<br> I warned you of his treachery.<br> Kill him! We're waiting for you to fulfil your commitment, commissioner.<br> Captain, I am happy to have you complete your mission of mercy to the planet Ariannus.<br> It was madness to interfere with such a worthwhile endeavour, but if you will, upon completion, please take me and my traitorous captive to Cheron.<br> I make no deals for control of this ship, sir.<br> The ship's course is now in your control.<br> Ship's course? Enterprise is now on course to Ariannus, captain.<br> Speed, Scotty? Warp 6 and smoothly operating, sir.<br> Good.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Let me reaffirm my position, gentlemen.<br> I could put you in the brig for what you've done, but I won't do it, because you're new to this part of the galaxy, which is governed by the United Federation of Planets.<br> We live in peace, with full exercise of individual rights.<br> The need to resort to violence and force has long since passed, and it will not be tolerated aboard this ship.<br> You are free to move about the ship.<br> I hope that you'll take the opportunity to know more about the Federation through its best representatives, my crew, but let me make it clear.<br> I will stand for no interference with the function of this ship.<br> All hands, return to normal routine.<br> Captain out.<br> You speak very well, captain.<br> Your words promise justice for all.<br> We try.<br> Yes, well, I have learned to wait for actions.<br> After Ariannus, what is justice? I shall wait to see it dispensed.<br> Fascinating.<br> Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.<br> Disgusting is what I call them.<br> That description is not scientifically accurate.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the word \"disgusting\" describes exactly what I feel about those two.<br> That's enough for today.<br> Those two are beginning to affect you.<br> And I know from my actions, you must all think me a volcanic hothead, erupting lava from my nostrils at danger signals that are only figments of my imagination.<br> But believe me, my friends, there can be no moment when I can have my guard down where such as Bele is present.<br> So, what happens? I act the madman out of the anger and frustration he forces upon me, and thereby prove his point that I am a madman.<br> No one knows how he'll react under pressure, Lokai.<br> After all, we are only human.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, therein lies my lack of ability to alert you and your captain to the real threat of someone like Bele.<br> You see, you are from the planet Earth.<br> There is no persecution on your planet.<br> How can you understand my fear, my apprehension, my degradation, my suffering? There was persecution on Earth once.<br> I remember reading about it in my history class.<br> Yes, but it happened way back in the 20th century.<br> There is no such primitive thinking today.<br> You have read about it in history, I see.<br> How can I make your flesh know how it feels to see all those who are like you, and only because they are like you, despised, slaughtered, and even worse, denied the simplest bit of decency that is a living being's right? Do you know what it would be like to be dragged out of your hubble into a war on another planet, a battle that will serve your oppressor and bring death to you and your brothers? Putting the matter into the hands of your Starfleet Command is, of course, the proper procedure.<br> How long will it be before we hear from them, captain? I expect the answer is already on its way.<br> Well, then, let us drink to their wise solution to our problem.<br> Let's do that.<br> Commissioner, Starfleet Command may not arrive at the solution you anticipate.<br> There is the matter of the shuttlecraft which Lokai appropriated.<br> The interrogation of that matter may be of paramount importance to Starfleet.<br> Gentlemen, we are discussing a question of degree.<br> Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft cannot be equated with the importance of murdering thousands of people.<br> We do not know that Lokai has done that.<br> One thing we are agreed on is that Lokai is a criminal.<br> No, commissioner.<br> One thing we agreed upon is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft.<br> Excuse me.<br> Lieutenant Uhura to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - I have a communication - from Starfleet Command, sir.<br> - Let's read it.<br> \"Starfleet Command extends greetings to Commissioner Bele of the planet Cheron.<br> His urgent request to be transported to his planet with the man he claims prisoner has been taken under consideration.<br> It is with great regret that we cannot honour that request.<br> Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies that no being can be extradited without due process.<br> In view of the circumstances, we have no doubt that after a hearing at starbase, Commissioner Bele will be permitted to retain his prisoner, and will be provided transportation\" That's enough.<br> Thank you.<br> As always, Lokai has managed to gain allies.<br> Now, wait a minute, commissioner.<br> Even if they don't recognise themselves as being such.<br> Yes, he will evade, delay and escape again, and in the process, put thousands of innocent beings at each other's throats, getting them to kill and maim for a cause which they have no stake in, but which he will force them to violently espouse by twisting their minds with his lies, his loathsome accusations and his foul threats.<br> I can assure you, commissioner, that our minds will not be twisted.<br> Not by Lokai, nor by you.<br> It is obvious to the most simpleminded that Lokai is of an inferior breed.<br> The obvious visual evidence, commissioner, is that he is of the same breed as yourself.<br> Are you blind, Commander Spock? Well, look at me.<br> Look at me.<br> You're black on one side and white on the other.<br> I am black on the right side.<br> - I fail to see the significant difference.<br> - Lokai is white on the right side.<br> All of his people are white on the right side.<br> Commissioner, perhaps the experience of my own planet Vulcan may set an example of some value to you.<br> Vulcan was in danger of being destroyed by the same conditions and characteristics which threatened to destroy Cheron.<br> We were once a people like yourselves, wildly emotional, often committed to irrationally-opposing points of view, leading, of course, to death and destruction.<br> Only the discipline of logic saved my planet from extinction.<br> Commander Spock, I am delighted that Vulcan was saved, but you cannot expect Lokai and people like him to act with self-discipline, any more than you can expect a planet to stop orbiting its sun.<br> Let Lokai state his grievances.<br> Hear him.<br> Listen to him.<br> Maybe he can change.<br> - Maybe he wants to change.<br> - They cannot change.<br> Change is the essential process of all existence.<br> For instance, the people of Cheron must have once been mono-coloured.<br> You mean like both of you? There must have been a time long ago no doubt when that was true.<br> Excuse me.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - We're orbiting Ariannus, sir.<br> Very good.<br> Commence decontamination procedures when ready.<br> - Advise when complete.<br> - At once, sir.<br> Scott out.<br> I once heard that on some of your planets, people believe they are descended from apes.<br> The actual theory is that all life forms evolved from the lower levels to the more advanced stages.<br> Ready for decontamination procedure.<br> - Ready, sir.<br> - Ready here.<br> Ready, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, lock into coordinates requested by Ariannus.<br> Locked in, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, position tanks for spray release.<br> Tanks positioned.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus the mission is to begin on signal.<br> All ground precautions must be ready.<br> Ariannus says go ahead.<br> Well, let her rip.<br> - Scott to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> First run complete, sir.<br> Good.<br> Repeat procedure for maximum effect.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Ready to repeat decontamination procedure.<br> Ready, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu? - Ready here.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - We're completing the final orbit of Ariannus, sir.<br> I'm awaiting instructions to set course for the next destination.<br> Very good.<br> We'll be right up.<br> Set directional controls for Starbase 4.<br> Kirk out.<br> Will you join us on the Bridge? There is nothing I would like more.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5730.<br>7.<br> Having completed our mission to Ariannus, the Enterprise is now on course to Starbase 4.<br> The crew is on normal routine and we are proceeding without incident.<br> Trouble, Mr.<br> Chekov? I don't rightly know, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I was trying to program for Starbase 4 as ordered.<br> - I can't get a response.<br> - It just seemed to go dead, sir.<br> Captain, some of the memory banks of the computer - are burned out.<br> - Can you determine which ones? The directional control and the self-destruct, captain, are both burnt out.<br> I did it like this.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5730.<br>6.<br> In a deliberate act of sabotage, Commissioner Bele has burnt out our destruct mechanism and, through the power of his will, has again taken over directional control of the Enterprise.<br> Now can we go to Cheron without any more discussion? At the moment, I seem to have no choice.<br> So this is justice after Ariannus.<br> You have signed my death warrant.<br> I warned you what to expect.<br> Will you continue to let this mockery of justice go on? If you are partisans of justice, prove it.<br> Kill him! We are not killers.<br> So, what do you do? Carry justice on your tongues? You will beg for it, but you won't fight or die for it.<br> After so many years of leading the fight, you seem very much alive.<br> I doubt that the same can be said for many of his followers.<br> You're finished, Lokai.<br> Oh, we've got your kind penned in on Cheron, and it's not going to change.<br> You've combed the galaxy, and come up with mono-coloured trash, do-gooders and bleeding hearts.<br> You're dead, you half-white.<br> You useless pieces of bland flesh.<br> I'll take you with me, you half-black.<br> Bele, you keep this up and you'll never get to Cheron with your prisoner.<br> The Bridge of this ship will be irreparably damaged.<br> This'll be your final battlefield.<br> Your 50,000 years of pursuit will have been wasted.<br> And you, Lokai, will die here in space.<br> You'll inspire no more disciples.<br> Your cause will be ended.<br> Remember, captain, political sanctuary is my right.<br> I am your prisoner.<br> Honour that right or the fight will go on, and your ship will burn up.<br> You've made your point.<br> If you listen to his legalistic trickery, I shall have to destroy this ship and everybody aboard.<br> I understand.<br> Will you return the Enterprise to my control? Why not? Scotty, have repairs on directional control been completed? Aye, sir.<br> Rerouted.<br> Check controls and coordinates.<br> Controls operating, captain.<br> The Enterprise is responding as always.<br> - Captain, it's beautiful.<br> - Locking on to coordinates.<br> Captain, we are within scanning range of Cheron.<br> Is it within visual range? Coming within visual range now, captain.<br> Chekov, put it on the screen.<br> Extreme magnification.<br> - What are you picking up? - Several very large cities.<br> Uninhabited.<br> Extensive traffic systems barren of traffic.<br> Lower animals and vegetation encroaching on the cities.<br> No sapient life forms registering at all, captain.<br> There is no evidence of natural disaster, yet there are vast numbers of unburied corpses in all cities.<br> You mean, all the people are dead? All dead, captain.<br> They have annihilated each other totally.<br> My people, all dead? Yes, commissioner.<br> All of them.<br> - No one alive? - None at all, sir.<br> Your band of murderers did this! Your genocidal maniacs did this! Stop it! What's the matter with you two? Didn't you hear Spock? Your planet is dead.<br> There's nobody alive on Cheron because of hate.<br> The cause you fought about no longer exists.<br> Give yourselves time to breathe.<br> Give up your hate.<br> You're welcome to live with us.<br> Listen to me.<br> You both must end up dead if you don't stop hating.<br> You're an idealistic dreamer.<br> Bele.<br> - The chase is finished.<br> - He must not escape me.<br> Where can he go? Bele.<br> Shall I alert security, sir? No, lieutenant.<br> Where can they run? Captain, I have located them on ship sensors.<br> Bele is chasing Lokai on Deck 3.<br> Bele is passing Recreation Room 3, approaching the crewmen's lounge.<br> Lokai is running past the crewmen's lounge.<br> Lokai has just arrived on Deck 5.<br> Passing Recreation Room 3.<br> Captain, someone has activated the transporter mechanism.<br> Spock, anyone in the Transporter Room? Negative, captain.<br> Transporter Room is clear.<br> However, there is a life form materialising on the planet.<br> It is Lokai.<br> He's back on Cheron.<br> There's nobody there to try him.<br> His judges are all dead.<br> Captain, the transporter mechanism has been activated again.<br> - Of course.<br> - It is Bele, captain.<br> And another life form has appeared on Cheron.<br> It doesn't make any sense.<br> To expect sense from two mentalities of such extreme viewpoints is not logical.<br> But their planet's dead.<br> Does it matter now which one's right? Not to Lokai and Bele.<br> All that matters to them is their hate.<br> Do you suppose that's all they ever had, sir? No.<br> But that's all they have left.<br> Warp factor 2, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Set course for Starbase 4.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> They have provided us with the coordinates for beam down.<br> May I have them, please? - Eight-seven-five.<br> - Eight-seven-five.<br> - Zero-two-zero.<br> - Zero-two-zero.<br> - Zero-seven-nine.<br> - Zero-seven-nine.<br> Let's go, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Energizing.<br> Mr.<br> Spock? Mr.<br> Spock, I have not yet transported down.<br> Why did you leave your post before confirming transport? Mr.<br> Spock? Spock? Engineering? Mr.<br> Scott? Scotty? Lieutenant Uhura, report immediately.<br> All Bridge personnel, report immediately.<br> Kirk to crew, is anyone aboard? Sickbay? Dr.<br> McCoy? Bones, Bones, answer me.<br> Bones.<br> Still orbiting Gideon.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> I am alone on the Enterprise.<br> I have searched every area of the ship and still cannot find a trace of the crew or an indication of how its disappearance was managed.<br> One thing that is obvious is that I suffered a memory lapse, during which time I bruised my arm.<br> It is causing me some irritation.<br> Gideon is contacting us, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Put it on the screen.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain Kirk, this is Ambassador Hodin.<br> The council is awaiting your arrival.<br> This is Mr.<br> Spock, Ambassador Hodin.<br> Captain Kirk was transported down minutes ago.<br> - That's impossible.<br> - I transported him myself.<br> He never arrived.<br> He was beamed directly to your council chambers.<br> Please verify your coordinates.<br> Coordinates confirmed.<br> We gave you the exact coordinates, which should have brought Captain Kirk directly into this room.<br> I am not questioning that, sir.<br> If he is not here, that is your own responsibility, Mr.<br> Spock, and that of your staff.<br> I do not deny that, sir.<br> I am not attempting to blame your personnel.<br> We are glad to hear that.<br> We shall have to enter it into the records of this most unfortunate event.<br> Your Excellency, even with intricate machinery as delicately balanced as ours, there is still a margin for error that must be dealt with.<br> It is possible that Captain Kirk materialised on some other part of Gideon.<br> Let us hope it was on dry land.<br> Your Excellency.<br> May I cut right to the heart of the matter? I request permission to beam down to conduct a search for our captain.<br> Permission denied.<br> Your Federation must be aware of our jealous tradition of isolation from all contaminating contacts with the violent nature of planets of other star systems.<br> Your Excellency, the wars between opposing star systems no longer prevail in our galaxy.<br> If you will grant permission Of course, we shall institute a thorough search.<br> In the meantime, Mr.<br> Spock, I suggest that you look to your machinery.<br> We must acknowledge once and for all that the purpose of diplomacy is to prolong a crisis.<br> Well, what are we waiting for, Mr.<br> Spock? We're not diplomats.<br> We are representatives of the Federation, doctor.<br> That doesn't mean that we have to behave like children and listen to some fool lecture by a diplomat.<br> Unfortunately, diplomacy is the only channel available to us at the moment.<br> The planet is shielded from our sensors, therefore, we cannot scan it.<br> Therefore, we are unable to select coordinates.<br> They must be provided by Gideon.<br> We should never have agreed to such restrictions.<br> We did not, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> The Federation did.<br> - Lieutenant Uhura.<br> - Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Contact Starfleet immediately.<br> Explain our problem.<br> Request permission to use every means at our disposal to press the search for Captain Kirk.<br> At once, sir.<br> Are there any other possibilities? There are endless, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> But where do we start, Mr.<br> Spock? Institute a sensor scan 360 degrees, one degree at a time.<br> You mean, you're gonna scan space for him? But, sir, that could take years.<br> Then the sooner you begin, the better.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Who are you? Odona.<br> Yes.<br> My name is Odona.<br> Why did you bring me here? What are you doing on my ship? Is this entire ship yours? Not my personal property, but I'm the captain.<br> And you have it all to yourself? It seems, at the moment, we have it all to ourselves.<br> You're hurting me, captain.<br> Kirk.<br> I'm sorry.<br> James Kirk.<br> And I didn't bring you here.<br> If you didn't bring me here That's right.<br> Who has brought you here? - I don't know.<br> - You What happened before you came here? Try to remember.<br> It's important.<br> It seems I was standing in a Yes, I was standing in a large auditorium, crowded with people.<br> Thousands, pressed in against me.<br> I could hardly breathe.<br> I was fighting for oxygen, screaming to get out.<br> Don't be afraid.<br> I'm not, but you are troubled.<br> I seem to be the only one of my crew left onboard the Enterprise.<br> Four hundred and thirty, and I, apparently, am the only one left.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I wish I could help.<br> Maybe you can.<br> Tell me the rest.<br> You were fighting for oxygen? Screaming to get out of there? And then suddenly, I was here on this On your ship.<br> And there was all this space and the freedom.<br> I just wanted to float.<br> And then there you were.<br> How long have you been aboard the Enterprise? I don't know.<br> Not long.<br> - Is it important? - It might be.<br> Come with me.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, has Starfleet honoured our request with a reply? There's been no responses yet, sir.<br> Did you advise them that the captain's life is at stake? Yes, sir.<br> They insist the matter must be referred to the Federation.<br> - What department? - The Bureau of Planetary Treaties.<br> - Contact them directly.<br> - I did, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> They insist that we must go through Starfleet channels.<br> With the captain lost somewhere, that's the best they can come up with? Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently, but they achieve exactly the same results.<br> Nine minutes of my life has been lost.<br> I don't understand.<br> Between the time I tried to beam down to Gideon and the time I found myself here alone, nine minutes have disappeared, just like that.<br> Now, what happened during those nine minutes? What is Gideon? That's your home.<br> The planet that you come from.<br> - Is it? - Well, it must be.<br> - Gideon? I don't know any Gideon.<br> - That's impossible.<br> We were in synchronous orbit over the capital city of Gideon.<br> I tried to beam down.<br> Something happened.<br> And you were beamed aboard from Gideon.<br> I do not think so.<br> We're no longer over Gideon.<br> Where are we? I don't know.<br> I'm not familiar with that quadrant.<br> Odona, you must realise that we're not here by accident.<br> Some force, some intelligence has arranged this for a purpose.<br> Captain, before, I said I wasn't afraid.<br> Now I am.<br> The ambassador will speak, sir.<br> They are requesting visual communication.<br> Good news.<br> Very good news indeed, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your captain is definitely not on Gideon.<br> As you requested, we made a most thorough search.<br> You will be relieved to know that you may now investigate all the other possibilities and forget about Gideon.<br> That That is not what we requested.<br> You requested a most thorough search.<br> It is in the record.<br> And we have used every means at our disposal to accommodate you.<br> Your record on the subject is not precise, Your Excellency.<br> Surely, Mr.<br> Spock, you do not intend, I hope, to create a dispute between the Federation and Gideon.<br> Your Excellency, a dispute is the farthest thing from our minds and there is no need to check your records.<br> I merely suggest that the language of our statement may not have been understood exactly as intended.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you are an officer of a spaceship.<br> In your profession, you use many instruments, tools and weapons to achieve your objectives.<br> True, Your Excellency.<br> However, the only tool diplomacy has is language.<br> It is of the utmost importance that the meaning be crystal clear.<br> Your Excellency, I am basically a scientist.<br> Clarity of formulation is essential in my profession also.<br> I am glad to hear it.<br> Perhaps you could then make greater effort to choose your words more precisely.<br> You don't let him get away with that.<br> No matter what you say, Mr.<br> Spock, he'll twist your meaning.<br> Yes, he's infuriating, sir.<br> How can you stand it? We cannot leave without being absolutely sure ourselves that everything has been done.<br> Now, certainly you understand our feelings about that.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? Mr.<br> Spock? - Yes, Your Excellency.<br> - Are you still there? - Yes, Your Excellency.<br> There was interference with your transmission.<br> A lot of noise drowned out what was said.<br> Would you repeat, please? I apologise for the noise, Your Excellency.<br> To summarise, I request permission to transport down to Gideon.<br> Forgive me, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No criticism of your equipment was intended.<br> But it has sent your captain on some strange journey, a safe one, we all still hope.<br> But it could create for us serious incidents with your Federation.<br> And now you propose to repeat this disaster with another officer? This would be madness.<br> I'll not take that, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That transporter was in perfect condition.<br> I guarantee that myself.<br> Transport me down and I'll prove to those gentlemen.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, you'll go to the Transporter Room and await my orders.<br> Aye, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I could not quite make that out, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Would you be so good as to repeat what you said? Yes, Your Excellency.<br> The ship's engineer was explaining that the malfunction, which did exist, has now been repaired.<br> We would appreciate an opportunity to test the equipment.<br> I therefore request permission to beam down to your council chamber.<br> But, Mr.<br> Spock, you Your Excellency, grant this one request.<br> You are a very persistent fellow, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Very well, then.<br> You shall test the skill of your very excitable repairman.<br> There is one proviso.<br> We cannot risk further incidents.<br> You will therefore transport a member of my staff to your ship.<br> Let us first see if that works.<br> Thank you, Your Excellency.<br> Your proposal is accepted.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott? - Scott here.<br> Prepare to beam aboard a representative of the Gideon Council.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br> My assistant will provide you with the proper What is the word? Coordinates.<br> Thank you.<br> Proceed, Krodak.<br> - Eight-seven-five.<br> - Eight-seven-five.<br> - Zero-two-zero.<br> - Zero-two-zero.<br> - Seven-zero-nine.<br> - Seven-zero-nine.<br> Energizing.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, the gentleman from Gideon is here.<br> Your Excellency, your assistant has arrived safely and I am now ready to transport down to Gideon.<br> Now, now, not so fast, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is quite a different matter.<br> We agreed to allow one representative on our soil, your captain.<br> Sir, our captain is still missing, and I now demand that I be allowed to transport to Gideon as we agreed.<br> Forgive me, Mr.<br> Spock, but I overstepped my authority when I made that agreement.<br> However, your request will be taken up at the next full session of Gideon's council.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, beam down the gentleman from Gideon.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm sending him straight to the same coordinates.<br> And just when I was beginning to think you might find a whole new career as a diplomat, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Do not give up hope, doctor.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, contact Starfleet Command.<br> Demand an immediate reply to our request for permission to beam down to Gideon.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Enterprise to Starfleet Command.<br> Enterprise to Starfleet Command.<br> Enterprise to Starfleet Command.<br> Enterprise to Starfleet Command.<br> Captain Kirk here.<br> Red priority.<br> Red priority.<br> - Isn't it in working order? - It seems to be.<br> Then someone should have heard you.<br> Captain Kirk here.<br> Please answer red priority.<br> Please answer red priority.<br> If someone is listening, they're not answering.<br> Why should they do that? They wouldn't.<br> - What did you do? - Took the ship out of warp speed.<br> - Out of what? - Space terminology.<br> We're no longer moving faster than the speed of light.<br> I've trimmed down to sublight speed until we find out where we are.<br> - It feels the same.<br> - Of course it does.<br> Maybe it is the same.<br> Well, has the ship slowed down? If you can believe that, we have.<br> Please.<br> Don't tell me the sky is out of order now.<br> It's so quiet.<br> So peaceful.<br> It isn't really, you know.<br> And it's beautiful.<br> Yes.<br> Yes, it is.<br> Very, very beautiful.<br> And we're alone.<br> Can you make it last a long, long time? How long would you like it to last? Forever.<br> Well, let's see.<br> Power, that's no problem.<br> It regenerates.<br> And food, we have enough to feed a crew of 430 for five years.<br> - So that should last us - Forever.<br> All my life I've dreamed of being alone.<br> Most people are afraid of being alone.<br> Where I come from, people dream of it.<br> Why? Why are the people of Gideon like that? Gideon? I told you I don't know where I come from, what my planet is.<br> - It might be Gideon.<br> - Does it matter so much? Yes.<br> It might help me pinpoint our location.<br> And then you might find your crew.<br> Being here with you, I forgot there must be others.<br> I envy you your sense of loyalty.<br> I want to ease your feeling of dread, your fear that all your crew no longer exists.<br> I've got to contact whoever's manipulating us.<br> There must be a way.<br> Odona.<br> Odona, can you remember why your people dream of being alone? Because they never can be.<br> Why? What makes it so impossible to be alone? Because there are so many of us.<br> So many.<br> There is no place, no street, no house, no garden, no beach, no mountain that is not filled with people.<br> Each one of us would kill in order to find a place alone to himself.<br> They would willingly die for it if they could.<br> Who sent you here? No one commands Odona.<br> I was not sent here.<br> You've come to kill.<br> Odona, have you come to die? I don't know.<br> I don't care.<br> I only know I'm here.<br> I only know I'm happy.<br> Now all I have to do is find a medical kit and I can completely cure this.<br> - Cure? - Yes, the irritation would be gone.<br> What will happen if you do not find one? Will you become sick and die? Oh, no.<br> Not from something as simple as this.<br> No, it'll cure itself eventually, but Do you know, I don't even remember how this happened.<br> Do you hear that? Yes, it sounds like an engine.<br> No, the ship's engines don't make that kind of sound.<br> But something is wrong with the equipment.<br> Could that be it? I know every sound that this ship might make.<br> That's coming from outside.<br> - A storm might - A storm might.<br> But you wouldn't be able to hear it.<br> Come on.<br> This is a viewing port.<br> We'll be able to see outside.<br> If there's a storm, we'll be able to see it.<br> If it works.<br> People.<br> The faces of people.<br> And then the stars.<br> What's happening? What's out there? The sound is gone.<br> It was like the heartbeat of all those people and thousands upon thousands more pressing against the ship.<br> But you said we were moving through space.<br> Yes, I said that.<br> Then the people can't be out there.<br> Yes, they can.<br> Please don't frighten me.<br> It could be a mirage.<br> They could exist in our minds.<br> You mean that we're going mad.<br> Or some power is creating the illusion in our minds that we are somewhere near your planet.<br> But why? I don't know.<br> I don't know.<br> I think I have an idea.<br> So that we won't keep trying to find out where we are, that we'll be content to stay here.<br> Be content.<br> Be content? Be content? Not until I find out what happened to my crew.<br> - Are they dead? - I don't know.<br> Did you kill them so you could have the ship to yourself? Captain Captain, something is happening to me.<br> I never felt like this before.<br> I've never felt like this before either.<br> Is this the way one looks when one is developing a sickness? There's no sickness on your planet, remember? Now there will be.<br> There will be sickness.<br> There will be death.<br> - Hodin.<br> - Yes, Captain Kirk.<br> Our experiment has passed the first stage.<br> Let me in there.<br> I can help her.<br> We have no need of any of your medicines.<br> But she's ill.<br> We're grateful to you for her illness.<br> You have done well, my daughter.<br> Guard the captain well.<br> We shall need him for a long time.<br> I sympathise deeply, but Starfleet cannot override Federation directives in this matter.<br> Admiral, the crew will not understand it.<br> Has your crew suddenly become interested in provoking a war? That is not Starfleet's mission.<br> We wish only to save the life of the captain.<br> You have not proved your case to the Federation, or to Starfleet for that matter.<br> I am positive that I can do so to your satisfaction, admiral.<br> I have been convinced since my first exchange with the ambassador that the captain has been taken prisoner.<br> Granted as fact, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I now know where the captain is being held.<br> If he is being held at the same place to which we transported him.<br> They would not dare harm him in the Gideon council chamber.<br> Sir, the captain is not being held in the Gideon council chamber.<br> He is being held nearby.<br> You have now answered what and where.<br> I am waiting for your explanation of why.<br> Since the planet is shielded from our sensors, we cannot establish that without on-the-spot investigation.<br> Do you have evidence the captain's life is threatened? Permission denied.<br> Admiral, I wish to state for the record that your decision is completely arbitrary.<br> So noted.<br> Will it last long? That depends on the strength of the one infected.<br> You have great strength.<br> How will you know when I am to die? Your body temperature will be very great.<br> You will see us, but you will not know who we are.<br> I must see him before then Lie still.<br> Lie still.<br> Do you feel great pain? Yes.<br> In my arms and thighs.<br> What is it like to feel pain? It is like Like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father.<br> You feel great despair.<br> And your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing.<br> Pain is like that.<br> Your courage gives me great pride.<br> - Let me see her.<br> - Not yet.<br> - You don't know what she may have.<br> - But we do.<br> She has Vegan choriomeningitis.<br> It's very rare and always fatal if not treated within 24 hours.<br> I know.<br> It almost killed me.<br> Yes, our prime minister learned about you during our negotiations.<br> That's why we brought you here.<br> Your blood provided the microorganisms which infected her.<br> That's how my arm got hurt.<br> Yes.<br> As Odona told you, we have no need for medical practitioners here.<br> Our apologies.<br> We were unforgivably awkward to have hurt you.<br> You're mad.<br> No, we are desperate.<br> I don't understand how Starfleet can deny us permission to beam down to search for the captain.<br> They did not ask for our understanding, doctor.<br> I don't see how they expect us to sit here and wait for the captain to reappear.<br> Unfortunately, I must violate a direct order from Starfleet.<br> That's the best possible decision you can make.<br> I'm with you.<br> I do not make it lightly, doctor.<br> However, Command knows that Ambassador Hodin has not been totally honest with us.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, repeat original Gideon coordinates for beam down.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, the coordinates given you? Coordinates don't match.<br> Precisely.<br> I shall beam down at once.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, you have the conn.<br> I'll pick up my medical tricorder, meet you in the Transporter Room.<br> Negative, doctor.<br> I cannot accept the responsibility for ordering a fellow officer to violate a Starfleet directive.<br> I can make such a decision only for myself.<br> I'm not asking you to make the decision for me.<br> The situation forces me to do so, doctor.<br> Well, in that case, it's the worst possible decision you can make, Spock.<br> This will not take long.<br> Isn't that just about what Captain Kirk said before he left? Captain Kirk, Spock here.<br> Captain Kirk? Your report to the Federation was a tissue of lies.<br> You described environmental, physical, cultural conditions that would make Gideon a paradise.<br> And so it was.<br> A long, long time ago, what we described was true.<br> The atmosphere on Gideon has always been germ-free, and the people flourished in their physical and spiritual perfection.<br> Eventually, even the lifespan increased.<br> Death became almost unknown to us.<br> It occurred only when the body could no longer regenerate itself, and that happens now only to the very old.<br> Those are conditions most people would envy.<br> But Gideon did not find it enviable.<br> The birthrate continued to rise and the population grew until now Gideon is encased in a living mass, who can find no rest, no peace, no joy.<br> Why haven't you introduced any of the new techniques to sterilize men and women? Every organ renews itself.<br> It would be impossible.<br> Then let your people learn about the devices to safely prevent conception.<br> The Federation will provide anything you need.<br> But, you see, the people of Gideon have always believed that life is sacred.<br> That the love of life is the greatest gift.<br> That is the one unshakeable truth of Gideon.<br> This overwhelming love of life has developed our regenerative capacity and our great longevity.<br> And the great misery that you now face.<br> That is bitterly true, captain.<br> Nevertheless, we cannot deny the truth which shaped our evolution.<br> We are incapable of destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we love so deeply.<br> Life, in every form, from foetus to developed being.<br> It is against our tradition, against our very nature.<br> We simply could not do it.<br> Yet you can kill a young girl.<br> We are trying to readjust the life cycle of an entire civilisation.<br> You're killing your own daughter.<br> How can you do that? My daughter hoped to make you feel the agony of Gideon.<br> But it was impossible.<br> No stranger could realise the horror that life can be here.<br> I will not beg for your understanding of my personal grief, nor will I parade it for you to gain your cooperation.<br> My love for my daughter is too deep for display.<br> My pride in her runs even deeper.<br> My daughter freely chose to do what she is doing, as the people of Gideon are free to choose.<br> The virus you need is very rare.<br> Who will provide it? You will stay.<br> Your blood will provide it.<br> No, sir.<br> Not me.<br> You have many methods available to you.<br> I have mentioned only a few.<br> I do not offer my life for this purpose.<br> I have many plans.<br> And I have hopes other than death for Odona.<br> My daughter pleaded with you to stay.<br> What was said and what happened between us was for us alone.<br> She hoped you would love her and wish to stay.<br> So that was your plan.<br> That I would fall so under her spell, that I would give up my freedom and become a willing sacrifice.<br> Stay with us.<br> We're desperate.<br> Odona's fever is rising.<br> She is calling the name of James Kirk.<br> You see, you cannot leave us now.<br> Go to her.<br> An exact duplicate of the Enterprise.<br> But completely inoperative.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Scott here, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I am speaking to you from the Bridge of the Enterprise.<br> You're where? On the Bridge of the Enterprise, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Those were the coordinates you insisted on.<br> And they were correct.<br> I'm onboard an exact duplicate of the Enterprise.<br> An exact duplicate of the Enterprise? Is it in orbit, Mr.<br> Spock? In orbit, doctor.<br> In a manner of speaking, Gideon is in orbit, and the ship is on Gideon.<br> Well, that's a beginning.<br> What about the captain? I'm sure he's onboard somewhere.<br> I'm picking up life readings.<br> Spock out.<br> Ship's log, stardate 5423.<br>8.<br> First Officer Spock reporting.<br> Obviously, the Gideons have transported Captain Kirk onto this replica of the Enterprise to so confuse his mind as to make him susceptible to some extraordinary experiment.<br> It is my intention to locate the captain and warn him before the experiment reaches its conclusion, which logic indicates means the end of the captain's life as he knows it.<br> If you don't allow me to bring Dr.<br> McCoy down here, it'll soon be too late to do anything for her.<br> We have told you, it is her wish and mine that there be no interference with the natural progress of the virus.<br> Her death is unnecessary.<br> Even if she lives, her blood will provide the same serum you need as mine would.<br> No, her death at so young an age will let the people know for certain that our life cycle can be changed.<br> It is the symbol that will bring forth the dedicated young volunteers.<br> The serum in their new blood will change Gideon, and it will once more be the paradise it was.<br> I'm glad that you're here.<br> Is the time short? Very short.<br> And I asked you to make our journey last forever.<br> It began here.<br> And it can continue.<br> If only you will allow me, I can cure you.<br> I am not afraid of what will happen.<br> It is just that now I wish with all my heart to stay with you forever.<br> Your Excellency.<br> Captain, you're looking well.<br> Evidently, Starfleet's analysis was correct.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we have a patient for Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Have Scotty beam us up.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> Spock to Enterprise.<br> - Scott here.<br> - Three to beam up, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Same coordinates? Negative.<br> Lock in on my communicator signal.<br> Your Excellency, please do not interfere.<br> I already have one serious problem to resolve with upper echelons.<br> Well, it was close, but you made it.<br> I am cured? Right.<br> Just like the captain.<br> Instead of smiling at me, you should be shouting in anger.<br> Why, because you're well again? No, because I pretended to be How can you bear to look at me after the way I deceived you? At least you owe me the privilege of letting me look at you.<br> You are a gentleman, Captain Kirk.<br> Thank you, ma'am.<br> You are no longer needed on Gideon.<br> I can take your place there.<br> Is that what you want to do? That is what I must do.<br> I am needed there now.<br> You're needed everywhere, Odona.<br> It is not like our ship.<br> Yes, it is.<br> It's exactly the same.<br> Only this one works.<br> - It goes to many other planets? - Yes, it goes to the whole galaxy.<br> With another difference.<br> This one is crowded.<br> It seems crowded to you? It does now.<br> Are you going to stay on the ship? Yes, Odona, I have to.<br> As crowded as my planet is, I could wish for it to hold one more person.<br> Kirk to Transporter Control.<br> One to beam down to the planet Gideon.<br> I will miss you, Captain James Kirk.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tA ghost planet? I suggest no supernatural explanation, captain.<br> I merely point out that the facts do not fit any known categories of planets.<br> Let's take the facts one by one.<br> They should explain something.<br> Undoubtedly.<br> The age of this planet would seem to be only a few thousand years.<br> It would be impossible for vegetation to evolve in so short a period.<br> Its size is approximately that of Earth's moon.<br> But its mass and its atmosphere are similar to Earth.<br> That would be difficult to explain.<br> It would be impossible, captain.<br> An atmosphere could not evolve in so short a period of time.<br> - And yet it has.<br> - Evidently.<br> But the inconsistencies are so compounded as to present a seemingly impossible phenomenon.<br> - But a fascinating one, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Precisely, captain.<br> It would bear closer investigation, it would seem, if we are to provide Starfleet with an accurate report.<br> Lieutenant, send Dr.<br> McCoy to the Transporter Room for survey party.<br> - We'll also need geologist D'Amato.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Beam down coordinates for the Transporter Room.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, you'll accompany me.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you have the conn.<br> Lieutenant Rahda, report to the Bridge immediately.<br> This expedition should be a geologist's dream, Mr.<br> D'Amato.<br> Well, the opportunity to explore so young a planet is an incredible bit of luck, captain.<br> If Mr.<br> Spock is correct, you'll have a report to startle the Fifth Interstellar Geophysical Conference.<br> - Why? What is it, Jim? - A planet even Spock can't explain.<br> Prepare to transport.<br> Energize.<br> Wait.<br> You must not go.<br> - Jim, did you see what I saw? - That woman attacked Ensign Wyatt.<br> - Kirk to - Captain.<br> Captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, are you all right? Yes.<br> I believe no permanent damage was done.<br> What happened? The occipital area of my head seems to have impacted with the arm of the chair.<br> No, Mr.<br> Spock, I meant, what happened to us? That we have yet to ascertain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The planet's gone.<br> What kind of earthquakes do they have in this place? I don't know.<br> Any more like that, they'll tear the planet apart.<br> Captain, this tremor we felt, if that's what it was And it's like no seismic disturbance I've felt before.<br> - I got a reading of almost immeasurable power, but it's not there anymore.<br> Could seismic stress have accounted for it? The reading I got had nothing to do with a seismic force.<br> That's very strange.<br> And that woman.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> - Shock may have damaged it.<br> - It's gone.<br> The Enterprise.<br> It's gone.<br> He's right.<br> There's nothing there.<br> How could it just be gone? What the devil does that mean, Jim? For one thing, it means we're stranded.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> The Enterprise must have blown up.<br> That would explain the high-radiation readings, wouldn't it, if the matter.<br>.<br>? Shouldn't we stop guessing, Mr.<br> Sulu, and try and establish a pattern? I get no readings of high-energy concentration.<br> If the Enterprise had blown up, it would have left a high residual radiation.<br> Could it be the Enterprise hit us? Hit the planet? Once in Siberia there was a meteor so great that it flattened whole forests and was felt as far Mr.<br> Sulu, if I'd wanted a Russian history lesson, I'd have brought along Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> This is a matter of survival, gentlemen.<br> Without the Enterprise, we need food, and we need water, and we need them fast.<br> I want a detailed analysis made of this planet and I want it now.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Engineering, no damage.<br> All power levels normal.<br> Damage-control report: Ship functioning normally.<br> Many bumps and bruises.<br> One casualty, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The transporter officer.<br> He's dead.<br> Dead? - Spock to Sickbay.<br> - Sickbay.<br> Dr.<br> M'Benga.<br> Report on the death of the transporter officer.<br> We're not sure.<br> Dr.<br> Sanchez is conducting an autopsy right now.<br> Give me a full report as soon as possible, please.<br> Spock out.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, have the transporter checked for possible malfunction.<br> Aye, sir.<br> No debris of any kind, sir.<br> I've made two full scans.<br> If the planet had broken up, there would be some sign.<br> What bothers me is the stars, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - The stars.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> They're wrong.<br> - Wrong? - Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Look.<br> Now, here's a replay of the star pattern just before the explosion.<br> A positional change.<br> It doesn't make any sense.<br> But somehow, I'd say, that in a flash, we've been knocked 1,000 light years away from where we were.<br> lieutenant.<br> That's not possible.<br> Nothing can do that.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, since we are here, your statement is not only illogical but also unworthy of refutation.<br> It is also illogical to assume that any explosion, even that of a small star going supernova, could have hurled us a distance of 990.<br>7 light years.<br> The point is it shouldn't have hurled us anywhere.<br> It should have destroyed us immediately, vaporised us.<br> That is correct, Mr.<br> Scott, by all the laws that we know.<br> There was no period of unconsciousness.<br> Our ship's chronometers registered a matter of only a few seconds.<br> Therefore we were displaced through space in some manner which I am unable to fathom.<br> What you're saying is that the planet didn't blow up.<br> The captain and the others, they're still alive.<br> Please, Mr.<br> Scott, restrain your leaps of illogic.<br> I have said nothing.<br> I was merely speculating.<br> - Sickbay to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Spock here.<br> You asked for an autopsy report.<br> It's only preliminary, but the cause of death seems to have been cellular disruption.<br> Explain.<br> It's as though every cell in the body had been individually blasted from inside.<br> Would any known disease organism do that? Dr.<br> Sanchez has ruled that possibility out, sir.<br> Please keep me fully advised.<br> Spock out.<br> He was in the Transporter Room.<br> Someone may have entered after Captain Kirk and his party left.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, since the Enterprise is obviously functional, I suggest we return to our starting place at top warp speed.<br> Aye, sir.<br> But even at that, it will take us a while to get there.<br> In that case, Mr.<br> Scott, I suggest we start at once.<br> Can you give me warp 8? Aye, sir.<br> And maybe a wee bit more.<br> I'll sit on the warp engines myself and nurse them.<br> That position, Mr.<br> Scott, would not only be unavailing, but also undignified.<br> Lieutenant Rahda, plot a course Already plotted and laid in, sir.<br> Good.<br> Then prepare to come to warp 8.<br> - Your report covers all vegetation? - Yes, captain.<br> All vegetation is inedible.<br> Poison to us.<br> If the Enterprise has been destroyed, you know how long we can survive.<br> Yes.<br> I don't see any water, but there must be some to grow the vegetation.<br> A source of water would stretch our survival.<br> Did you see any evidence of rainfall? No, sir.<br> And I haven't seen any evidence that there ever has been any rainfall.<br> But there is Earth-type vegetation.<br> Is it possible the vegetation could absorb the water directly from the air? Yes, that's possible.<br> There's also the possibility of underground water.<br> Yes, sir, could be.<br> Sulu's picked up an organism that's almost a virus.<br> Like a plant parasite.<br> And it's the nearest biological form of life that I can find.<br> This apparently is gonna our home for as long as we can last.<br> I suggest we find out as much as we can about it.<br> We'll split up.<br> D'Amato, see if you can find underground water.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Sulu, run an atmospheric analysis.<br> Bones, see if you can find out anything about the vegetation and your parasite.<br> How do they get their moisture? If you can discover how they survive, maybe we can.<br> Sulu to captain.<br> Kirk here.<br> Captain, I was making a standard magnetic sweep.<br> From zero, I suddenly got a reading that was off the scale, then a reverse of polarity and Now I get nothing.<br> I've never seen anything like this reading.<br> Like a door opened and then closed again.<br> Kirk out.<br> Do not be afraid.<br> I'm not.<br> Geological disturbances don't frighten me.<br> I've come here to study them.<br> - They're my speciality.<br> - I know.<br> You are Lieutenant D'Amato, senior geologist.<br> - That's right.<br> How did you know that? - From the spaceship Enterprise.<br> Yes, and we're stranded here.<br> Have you been talking to my friends? Do not be afraid.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> I am for you, Lieutenant D'Amato.<br> You're You're the woman on the Enterprise.<br> I am only for D'Amato.<br> Lucky D'Amato.<br> Wanna have a conference about sharing food and water.<br> Do not call the others.<br> Please.<br> - McCoy to Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Jim, I just got a life-form reading of tremendous intensity.<br> Suddenly it was just there.<br> - What do you mean, \"just there\"? - Just that.<br> All levels were normal and then I get this biological surge of life-form registering.<br> No.<br> Now it's gone.<br> As though a door opened and closed.<br> - Yes.<br> - What direction? - Zero-eight-three.<br> - Hang on.<br> D'Amato's section, come in.<br> Kirk to D'Amato.<br> Come in.<br> Come in.<br> Bones, Sulu, D'Amato doesn't answer.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Bones! Jim, every cell in his body's been disrupted.<br> Jim, what are you doing? Digging a grave.<br> Poor D'Amato.<br> What a terrible way to die.<br> There are no good ways, Sulu.<br> - That's the same red rock.<br> - My phaser didn't cut through.<br> Whatever it is, it has a mighty high melting point.<br> Eight thousand degrees centigrade.<br> It looks like igneous rock, but infinitely denser.<br> This whole planet must be made up of this substance, covered over by topsoil.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, it might explain this place a little better if we knew what the substance is.<br> I know it was D'Amato's field, but see what you can find out.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Well, I guess a tomb of rocks is the best we can provide for D'Amato.<br> Yeah.<br> It might be the most suitable memorial at that.<br> I wonder what killed him.<br> I don't know.<br> But something or someone did.<br> We're holding warp 8.<br>4, sir.<br> If we can maintain it, our estimated time of arrival is 11 and one-half solar hours.<br> I wish you would be more precise.<br> Scott to Bridge.<br> Scott to Bridge.<br> - Spock here.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, the ship feels wrong.<br> \"Feels,\" Mr.<br> Scott? I know it doesn't make sense.<br> Instrumentation reads correct but the feel is wrong.<br> It's something I can't quite put into words.<br> That is obvious, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I suggest you avoid emotionalism and simply keep your instruments correct.<br> Spock out.<br> It looks so lonely there.<br> It would be worse if he had company.<br> Doctor, how can you joke about it? I'm not joking.<br> Until we know what killed him, none of us are safe.<br> We've gotta figure this out and devise a defence against it.<br> Is it possible the rocks have life? You remember on Janus VI, the silicon creatures But our instruments recorded that.<br> They were life forms.<br> They registered as life forms.<br> Unless we're dealing with beings Intelligent beings who can shield themselves.<br> Beings intelligent enough to have destroyed the Enterprise? That's the problem, Sulu.<br> We have only questions.<br> No answers.<br> Watkins.<br> Check the bypass valve on the matter/antimatter reaction chamber.<br> Make sure it's not overheating.<br> But, Mr.<br> Scott, the board shows correct.<br> I didn't ask you to check the board, lad.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Who are you? My name is not important.<br> Yours is Watkins.<br> John B.<br> Engineer Grade 4.<br> You know all about me.<br> I've never seen you before.<br> Show me this unit.<br> I wish to learn.<br> This is the matter/antimatter integrator control.<br> That's the cutoff switch.<br> Not correct.<br> That is the emergency overload bypass, which engages almost instantaneously.<br> A wise precaution considering it takes the antimatter longer to explode once the magnetic flow fails.<br> I am for you, Mr.<br> Watkins.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, there's a strange woman who knows the plan of the Enterprise.<br> Oh, you poor lad.<br> - Scott to Bridge.<br> Scott to Bridge.<br> - Spock here.<br> My assistant, Watkins, is dead.<br> Do you know what he died of, Mr.<br> Scott? I didn't see it happen, but his last words were a warning cry about some strange woman.<br> Security alert, all decks.<br> Female intruder, extremely dangerous.<br> Security alert, all decks.<br> Conclusions.<br> The basic substance of this planet is an alloy of diburnium-osmium.<br> It couldn't have evolved naturally.<br> Captain, it doesn't make sense.<br> In fact, nothing about this planet makes sense.<br> Except for a momentary fluctuation on your instruments, this planet has no magnetic field.<br> The apparent age of these rocks is only a few thousand years.<br> No known process could evolve the plant life they have here in that short space of time.<br> Are you suggesting this might be an artificial planet? But, captain, where are the people who made it? Why can't we see them? Planet might be hollow.<br> They might be shielding themselves from our sensor probes.<br> It's dark.<br> Let's get some rest.<br> Tomorrow we'll have to find some food and some water, or it's going to be a very unpleasant stay.<br> - While it lasts.<br> - I'll take the first watch, sir.<br> All right.<br> Take D'Amato's tricorder.<br> Set it for automatic distress.<br> - You never can tell.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Spock to Sickbay.<br> Have you completed the autopsy on Watkins, doctor? Yes, we have, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Was the cause of his death the same as that which killed the transporter officer? Well, the pattern of cellular disruption was the same.<br> But as to the cause, well, your guess is as good as mine.<br> My guess, doctor, would be valueless.<br> I suggest we refrain from guessing and find some facts.<br> Spock out.<br> The power of this intruder to disrupt every cell in a body, combined with the almost inconceivable power required to hurl the Enterprise such a distance, speak of a very high culture and a very great danger.<br> You mean that one of the people that threw us 1,000 light years away from that planet is onboard and killing our people? A reasonable assumption, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Then you're right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Watkins must have been murdered.<br> I sent him in to check the matter/antimatter reactor.<br> There are no exposed circuits there.<br> It couldn't have been anything he touched.<br> If there are more of those beings on that planet, the captain and the others are in very great danger.<br> I am unarmed.<br> - Who are you? - That is not important.<br> You are Lieutenant Sulu.<br> You were born on the planet Earth.<br> You are helmsman for the Enterprise.<br> How do you know this? Where did you get this information? - Are you from this planet? - I am from here.<br> Then the planet is hollow.<br> Who killed Lieutenant D'Amato? All right.<br> The captain will want to talk to you.<br> That way.<br> Move.<br> You do not understand.<br> I have come for you.<br> What do you want? I want to touch you.<br> You were on the Enterprise.<br> Keep back.<br> Stop or I'll shoot.<br> I don't wanna have to kill a woman.<br> Captain Kirk! Captain Kirk! Hold it.<br> Who are you? I am for him.<br> I am for Lieutenant Sulu.<br> Don't let her touch you, captain.<br> That's how D'Amato died.<br> Phasers won't stop her.<br> I am for Lieutenant Sulu.<br> Please.<br> I must touch him.<br> How can you destroy others and not me? I don't want to destroy.<br> I don't want to.<br> Who are you? Why are you trying to kill us? Only Sulu.<br> I mean you no harm.<br> Are there men on this planet? Please, I must touch him.<br> I am for Lieutenant Sulu.<br> No! Bones, did you see that? Maybe Spock was wrong.<br> Perhaps this is a ghost planet.<br> All I know is that she almost made a ghost out of Sulu.<br> His shoulder, where she touched it, every cell has been disrupted.<br> Exploded from within.<br> If she'd gotten a good grip on him, Jim How can such people be, captain? Such evil, and she's so So beautiful.<br> Yes, I know.<br> Security sweeps of all decks are negative, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> No evidence of intruder.<br> Very well.<br> Cancel red alert but maintain increased security.<br> Aye, sir.<br> All decks cancel red alert.<br> Maintain increased security.<br> Update our subspace report to Starfleet to include \"security search: Results negative.<br>\" How did she get off the ship, sir? Presumably, the same way she got on.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, what are the chances of the captain and the others being alive? Lieutenant, we are not engaged in gambling.<br> We are proceeding in the only logical way, to return to the place where they were last seen and factually ascertain whether or not they still live.<br> Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, speed has increased to warp 8.<br>8.<br> - Bridge to Engineering.<br> - Scotty here.<br> I see it.<br> It's a power surge.<br> I'm working on it.<br> Reduce speed until I locate the trouble.<br> - Very well.<br> Reduce speed to warp 7.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Warp 7.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Our speed has increased to warp 8.<br>9 and still climbing.<br> Bridge to Engineering.<br> Negative effect on power reduction.<br> Speed is still increasing.<br> Aye, Mr.<br> Spock, and I've found out why.<br> The emergency bypass control of the matter/antimatter integrator is fused.<br> It's completely useless.<br> The engines are running wild.<br> There's no way to get at them.<br> We should reach maximum overload in about 15 minutes.<br> I would calculate 14.<br>87 minutes, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Those few seconds will not make any difference, Mr.<br> Spock, because you and I and the rest of the crew will no longer be here to bandy it back and forth.<br> This thing is going to blow up.<br> And there's nothing in the universe that can stop it.<br> There's a layer of necrotic tissue a few cells thick.<br> A normal wound would heal quickly.<br> She just touched me.<br> How could it happen so fast? That's a good question.<br> She touched the transporter chief and he collapsed immediately.<br> She apparently got to D'Amato.<br> We saw what happened to him.<br> Question is, why are you alive? Captain, I'm happy the way it turned out.<br> Jim.<br> What kind of power must she have? The power to totally disrupt biological cell structure.<br> Sulu's alive because I intervened.<br> But that raises an even worse question.<br> Why didn't she kill you? She's not through yet.<br> It's useless.<br> And there's no question, it's deliberate.<br> - Sabotage.<br> - Aye.<br> And a thorough job.<br> The system's foolproof.<br> Whoever murdered Watkins sabotaged this.<br> You said it was fused.<br> How? - Well, that's what worries me.<br> - \"Worries,\" Mr.<br> Scott? Well, it's fused all right, but it would take all the power of our main phaser banks to do it.<br> Interesting.<br> I find nothing interesting in the fact that we're about to blow up.<br> No.<br> But the method is fascinating.<br> Whatever did this is still aboard this ship.<br> I fail to understand why you've cancelled the security alert.<br> A force that could hurl us and at that distance, still be able to sabotage our main source of energy, will not be waiting around to be taken into custody.<br> Aye.<br> As I recall the pattern of our fuel flow, there is an access tube leading to the matter/antimatter reaction chamber.<br> Aye, there's a service crawlway, but it's not meant to be used while the integrator operates.<br> Still, it is there.<br> And it might be possible to shut off the flow of fuel at that point.<br> What with? Bare hands? A magnetic probe.<br> Any matter that comes in contact with antimatter triggers the explosion.<br> And I'm not even sure a man can live in a crawlway in the energy stream of the magnetic field that bottles up the antimatter.<br> I shall try.<br> You'll be killed, man.<br> Unless a solution is found quickly, that fate awaits all of us.<br> Aye.<br> You're right.<br> What have we got to lose? But I'll do it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I know every millimetre of that system.<br> I'll do whatever has to be done.<br> Very well, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> You spoke of the feel of the ship being wrong.<br> Aye.<br> It was an emotional statement.<br> I don't expect you to understand it.<br> I note it, Mr.<br> Scott, without necessarily understanding it.<br> I propose to run an analysis through the ship's computers comparing the present condition of the Enterprise with her ideal condition.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we don't have time for that.<br> We have 12 minutes and 27 seconds.<br> I suggest you do whatever you can in the service crawlway while I make the computer study.<br> Sulu, do you feel strong enough to move about? - I feel fine, captain.<br> - Is he, Bones? He's in fair shape.<br> All right.<br> Whatever destructive power this woman has seems to be aimed at one specific person at one specific time.<br> If I'm correct, when she reappears, the other two might be able to protect the one she's after by interposing their bodies.<br> No weapons seem to affect her.<br> But, captain, how does she know about us? Does she read our minds? Phaser on overload.<br> Controls are fused.<br> Drop.<br> Apparently she can destroy our weapons as well as destroy us.<br> Come on, let's go.<br> All right, lads.<br> Get the crawlway door open.<br> Hand me the tools.<br> Communicator.<br> All right.<br> Head first.<br> I hope Mr.<br> Spock knows what he's doing.<br> - Scott to Bridge.<br> - Go ahead, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> I've sealed off the aft end of the service crawlway and I've positioned explosive separator charges to blast me clear of the ship if I rupture the magnetic bottle.<br> I'm so close to the flow now it feels like ants crawling all over my body.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, I suggest you refrain from any further subjective descriptions.<br> You now have ten minutes and 19 seconds in which to perform your task.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we're at warp 11.<br>2 and accelerating.<br> I heard that.<br> The ship's not structured to take that speed for any length of time.<br> You now have ten minutes and ten seconds.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm starting to open the access panel now.<br> Access to the flow itself.<br> If the magnetic flow jumps, you must jettison me.<br> The safety control will not hold more than two seconds if I rupture the field.<br> I'm aware of these facts.<br> Please get on with the job.<br> - Computer? - Working.<br> Analysis on my comparison coordinates.<br> Unable to comply.<br> Comparison coordinates too complex for immediate readout.<br> Will advise upon completion.<br> I've removed the access plate and I've got static-electric charges dancing on the instruments.<br> Looks like an aurora borealis in there.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, you are monitoring the magnetic force? - Oh, yes, sir.<br> - Please do not take your eyes off it.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Lieutenant Rahda, arm the pod jettison system.<br> Aye, sir.<br> I'll jettison the pod at the first sign of trouble.<br> Not until my order.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Warp 11.<br>9.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, what is your situation? It's hard to see.<br> There's so much disturbance that any attempt to get at the flow would rupture the magnetic field.<br> You have eight minutes, I know what time it is.<br> I don't need a blooming cuckoo clock.<br> Captain, I'm getting that strange magnetic sweep again.<br> - From zero to off the scale.<br> - Yes.<br> Like a door opening.<br> Who have you come for this time? For you, James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Commander of the Enterprise.<br> Keep behind us, Jim.<br> Why do you wanna kill us? For defence.<br> You are Captain James T.<br> Kirk, commander of the Enterprise.<br> - Then why do you wanna kill me? - You are an invader.<br> We're here on a peaceful mission.<br> It's you who've killed our people.<br> We mean no harm to you.<br> We wanna leave peacefully.<br> Captain, I'm getting no life-form register.<br> An android? No, that would give a mechanical reading.<br> I'm getting nothing.<br> Who are you? I am Losira.<br> Commander.<br> - Commander of what? - Of this station.<br> Station? Station? Where? How do you feel about killing me? Feel? Killing is wrong.<br> - Stay between us.<br> - You must not penetrate this station.<br> Please, I must touch you.<br> You want to kill me? No.<br> Then why do it if you don't want to? I am sent.<br> By whom? We defend this place.<br> Are there others on this planet? They are no more.<br> How long have you been alone? Are you lonely? - She must be somewhere.<br> - She's not registering.<br> And there's this power surge, right off the scale.<br> Like a door closing.<br> It must be near here.<br> - Is the power level still holding, Jim? - Right off the scale.<br> It's remained at a peak ever since she disappeared.<br> The entrance is here.<br> You think we're being invited in? Certainly looks like it.<br> And the invitation doesn't exactly relax me.<br> I'd rather be on the Enterprise, sir.<br> I agree.<br> We've been led here.<br> Why? I don't know.<br> But whatever civilisation exists on this planet is in there.<br> And without the Enterprise, gentlemen, the only source of food and water is in there.<br> Let's go.<br> Computer readout.<br> Comparison analysis complete.<br> Continue.<br> Transporter factor M7 reassembled outphase.<br>0009.<br> - Fifty-seven seconds to go, sir.<br> - Understood.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? - Spock here.<br> I'm gonna try to cut through the magnetic flow.<br> But if the probe doesn't precisely match the magnetic flow, there will be an explosion.<br> Starting right now.<br> Magnetic-force indicator jumping, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, ease off.<br> Magnetic force has dropped to normal, sir.<br> Warp 13.<br>2, sir.<br> Computer, for outphase condition, will reverse field achieve closure? Affirmative, if M7 factor maintained.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, reverse polarity on your magnetic probe.<br> Reverse polarity? That is correct, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> That will take some doing.<br> What purpose could it.<br>.<br>? Please commence.<br> I'll explain.<br> You were correct in your \"feel.<br>\" The Enterprise was put through a molecular transporter and reassembled out of phase.<br> Reverse polarity should seal the incision.<br> No time for theory.<br> I just hope you're right.<br> Twenty seconds, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I'm doing the best I can.<br> Wait.<br> It's stuck.<br> It's stuck.<br> Push the button.<br> Please continue, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Don't be a fool.<br> Push the button.<br> It's your last chance.<br> Don't be sentimental.<br> Push it.<br> I'm gonna die anyway.<br> Please continue.<br> It's loose.<br> But there's no time.<br> Push the button.<br> Nine seconds, eight seconds, seven seconds, six seconds, five seconds, four seconds, three seconds, two seconds, one.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, now.<br> Warp 14.<br>1.<br> Warp 14.<br> Magnetic forces steady.<br> Warp 13.<br>9 and dropping.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, you have accomplished your task.<br> You might at least say thank you.<br> For what purpose, Mr.<br> Scott? - What is it in you humans.<br>.<br>? - Never mind.<br> - That requires an overwhelming display of emotion in a situation such as this? Two men pursue the only reasonable course of action indicated and yet you feel that something else is necessary.<br> Who have you come for? Form a circle.<br> You see? You'd better tell us.<br> Tell us.<br> Who have you come for? Who have you come for? You're a very determined woman.<br> For me? I am for James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Gentlemen, I need your help.<br> Please.<br> I must touch you.<br> I beg it.<br> It is my existence.<br> We've seen the results of your touch.<br> But you are my match, James Kirk.<br> I must touch you.<br> Then I will live as one, even to the structure of your cells, the arrangement of chromosomes.<br> That is how you kill.<br> You'll never reach me.<br> - Watch out! - I am for McCoy.<br> That computer must be programming these replicas.<br> Women match our chromosome patterns after they touch us.<br> It's a very painful affair, I can tell you.<br> - I am for Sulu.<br> - Shift positions.<br> Captain, we can no longer protect each other.<br> Spock! The computer! Destroy it! Oh, Mr.<br> Spock, I certainly am glad to see you.<br> I thought the Enterprise had been destroyed.<br> I had the same misgivings about you, captain.<br> We returned and picked up your life-form readings only a moment ago.<br> Returned from where? From where this brain had the power to send the Enterprise: What a remarkable culture this is.<br> Was, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Its defences were run by computer.<br> I surmised that, captain.<br> Its moves were immensely logical.<br> But what people created this? Are there any representatives here? There were replicas of one of them.<br> But that power to re-create them has been destroyed.<br> That is a loss, captain.<br> Well, you wouldn't have thought so, Mr.<br> Spock, if you'd been among us.<br> My fellow Kalandans, welcome.<br> A disease has destroyed us.<br> Beware of it.<br> After your long journey, I'm sorry to give you only a recorded welcome.<br> But we who have guarded the outpost for you will be dead by the time you take possession of this planet.<br> I am the last of our advanced force left alive.<br> Too late the physicians discovered the cause of the sickness that kills us.<br> In creating this planet, we have accidentally produced a deadly organism.<br> I have awaited the regular supply ship from home for medical assistance, but I doubt now whether it will arrive in time.<br> I will set the outpost controls on automatic.<br> The computer will selectively defend against all life forms but our own.<br> My fellow Kalandans, I, Losira, wish you well.<br> The previous ships probably spread the disease all through their people.<br> The supply ship that she was waiting for never came.<br> All these thousands of years she's been waiting to greet people who were dead.<br> To do the job of defence, the computer projected a replica of the only image available: Losira's.<br> The computer was too perfect.<br> It projected so much of Losira's personality into the replica that it felt regret, guilt, at killing.<br> That bought us the time we needed to destroy it.<br> She must have been a remarkable woman.<br> And beautiful.<br> Beauty is transitory, doctor.<br> However, she was, evidently, highly intelligent.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Five to beam up.<br> - I don't agree with you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Indeed, captain?

Anything else, I'll keep to myself for the moment.<br> When a man of Scotty's years falls in love, the loneliness of his life is suddenly revealed to him.<br> His whole heart once throbbed only to the ship's engines.<br> He could talk only to the ship.<br> Now he can see nothing but the woman.<br> I didn't think Mr.<br> Scott would go for the brainy type.<br> I don't think he's even noticed she has a brain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? As soon as we're within viewing range of Memory Alpha, you and Romaine will go to your positions in the emergency manual monitor.<br> You will prepare for direct transfer of the equipment to Memory Alpha.<br> - Aye, captain.<br> - We're ready, sir.<br> Lieutenant, may I offer my congratulations on what will be your first assignment for the Federation.<br> - Yes, good luck, lieutenant.<br> - Thank you.<br> Captain, I'm picking up a high-intensity reading.<br> - Is that Memory Alpha? - No, sir.<br> Excuse me.<br> Magnification 8.<br> - What is that? - Indications are a storm, captain.<br> Although I have never seen one of such great intensity or strange conformation.<br> Readings? All sensor readings are at maximum calibration.<br> Captain, it is approaching at warp factor 2.<br>6 and accelerating.<br> Check that.<br> No natural phenomena can move faster than the speed of light.<br> It is definitely doing so, captain, therefore it cannot be a phenomenon of nature.<br> - Deflectors on.<br> Condition Yellow.<br> - Shields activated, captain.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, get us the devil out of here.<br> Full scan on the disturbance that penetrated the Bridge.<br> Lieutenant.<br> All decks, stand at report.<br> Mira.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy to the Bridge.<br> Emergency.<br> - Mira! What's that you're saying? Was she hurt by the fall or the action of the disturbance? I don't know.<br> Did you notice, Scotty? Well, after the disturbance was over, she just collapsed.<br> How's she doing, doctor? Well, I think she's coming around now.<br> Easy, now.<br> Easy.<br> You had quite a fall.<br> I'm l'm fine.<br> You let me be the judge of that.<br> Do you feel like walking to Sickbay? I'm fine, doctor.<br> Really, I am.<br> Is everybody else all right? Aye, they are.<br> Now, you just do what Dr.<br> McCoy ordered.<br> - Why? I feel - You go to Sickbay.<br> That's an order.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> - Would it be all right if I went along? No.<br> Stay at your post for the moment.<br> - Captain - Lieutenant Uhura.<br> - Yes, sir? - Damage report? - All stations are operative, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? Some equipment was temporarily out of order.<br> My sensors were inoperative.<br> - Any damage to the warp engines? - None, captain.<br> Good.<br> From the action of that storm, we'll need all the speed we can get.<br> Captain, it was not a storm.<br> Captain, during the disturbance, Memory Alpha was hailing.<br> I wanted to respond, but I couldn't make my hand move.<br> Captain.<br> It was not hands that were paralyzed.<br> It was eyes.<br> I could not force my eyes to look down and set a new course.<br> No, no, it was speech that was affected.<br> I couldn't utter a sound.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Explanation? Only of the result, not of the cause.<br> In each case, a different area of the brain was affected.<br> Our voluntary nerve functions were under some form of pressure.<br> Or attack.<br> Attack might be a more precise formulation, captain.<br> And Lieutenant Romaine seems most susceptible.<br> Are the readings corresponding, nurse? Everything appears normal, doctor.<br> Thank you.<br> What's that you're doing, nurse? Recording your responses in this computer.<br> Why? I haven't had a single response worth noting.<br> - Lieutenant, please.<br> - Well, have I? Lieutenant, there are 430 people aboard this ship.<br> You're the only one that passed out and I wanna know why.<br> I want to know why too.<br> You're the doctor.<br> You tell me.<br> This whole thing is a new experience for me.<br> This whole thing is a new experience for all of us.<br> All of you are accustomed to new experiences.<br> It's part of your work.<br> I'm not.<br> She might have something there, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> This is her first deep space trip, and you know how that affects people.<br> Well, if we can get on with this, Scotty, we might make that determination.<br> Now, then, tell me.<br> What did you feel before you passed out? - Nothing.<br> - Nothing? Absolutely nothing.<br> - Lieutenant - There is nothing more I can tell you.<br> Lieutenant, you're being completely uncooperative.<br> Are you putting that into my record? It's not true.<br> I'll put the facts into your record if I can get them.<br> Come on, now, Mira.<br> We must help the doctor.<br> Tell us what happened.<br> Perhaps you can explain to her that any career she hopes for in Starfleet requires discipline and cooperation.<br> Well, I'm sure that's what the lieutenant wants.<br> She just didn't understand.<br> Did you, now, lass? Well, with a bedside manner like that, Scotty, you're in the wrong business.<br> When the record of this is forwarded, I'll be sent back, won't I? Well, you will not.<br> That's ridiculous.<br> This getting used to space travel, that takes some doing.<br> Not everybody takes to it.<br> - Did you? - Well, me, that's different.<br> I was practically born to it.<br> - I want to continue.<br> - You will.<br> You passed your Starfleet preliminary examinations.<br> And this is just getting used to what you might call your space legs.<br> I hope that's all it is.<br> Captain, I've plotted the storm's path.<br> Mr.<br> Lemli.<br> Main screen projection.<br> On its present course, it will hit the Memory Alpha planetoid as it did us.<br> Lieutenant, try and warn Memory Alpha of the proximity of that phenomenon.<br> - Give me an ETA for its impact.<br> - I cannot, sir.<br> It has the ability to change speed.<br> Sir, I'm unable to establish contact with the planetoid.<br> I'm hailing on all frequencies.<br> No response.<br> It is of little consequence, captain.<br> Memory Alpha has no protective shields.<br> - No shields? - None, captain.<br> When the library complex was assembled, shielding was considered inappropriate to its totally academic purpose.<br> Since the information on the memory planet is freely available to everyone, special protection was deemed unnecessary.<br> Wonderful.<br> I hope the storm is aware of that rationale.<br> Completing approach to planetoid.<br> It is already over Memory Alpha, captain.<br> Its speed is incredible.<br> It's hitting the planetoid.<br> Are we within orbit range, Mr.<br> Chekov? Making final approach.<br> Lieutenant, try and warn I'm sorry, sir.<br> I can't break through this interference.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, how many people are on Memory Alpha? It varies with the number of scholars, researchers and scientists from various Federation planets who are using the computer complex.<br> Captain, we are within orbit range.<br> - Lock into orbit.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> It is leaving Memory Alpha, captain.<br> Sensors give no readings of generated energy from Memory Alpha, captain.<br> - Any life readings? - None.<br> Let's find out what's going on down there.<br> Kirk to Engineering.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, report.<br> Kirk to Engineering.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? Where the devil is he? Scotty, report to the Bridge.<br> Report to the Bridge.<br> Transporter Room, stand by.<br> I'm taking a landing party down there.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> - Scott here.<br> Scotty, where've you been? Where are you? - In the Sickbay.<br> - Are you sick? No.<br> I was just checking on the lass.<br> She's going to be fine, though.<br> There's nothing wrong with her.<br> Well, I'm relieved to hear your prognosis, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Is the doctor there with you or will I find him in Engineering? - McCoy here, Jim.<br> - Doctor, how's the girl? - Well, I think she's in good shape.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott seems to agree with you.<br> The two of you, meet me in the Transporter Room on the double.<br> Captain's log, supplemental, stardate 5725.<br>6.<br> The storm has cleared Memory Alpha.<br> It is heading away at incredible speed.<br> We have been unable to make contact with the planetoid.<br> Its silence is ominous.<br> We are beaming down to investigate.<br> Somehow I find transporting into the darkness unnerving.<br> Scotty, can you get us some more light? I'm afraid this light will have to do, captain.<br> The generator is inoperative.<br> - Damage report, Spock.<br> - Disaster for the galaxy, captain.<br> The central brain is damaged.<br> Memory core is burned out.<br> The loss to the galaxy may be irretrievable.<br> Captain! A very faint life reading in the immediate vicinity, captain.<br> Locate him.<br> Keep him alive.<br> We need more information about this enemy.<br> Over here, captain! - Bones, can you do something? - Not a thing, Jim.<br> The same garbled sounds Lieutenant Romaine made when she fainted after the storm.<br> - Are you sure? - Absolutely sure.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Sulu here.<br> Beam down Lieutenant Romaine immediately.<br> Spock.<br> Have you ever seen anything like that before? Negative.<br> - Bones? - She's dead.<br> - What did she die of? - Severe brain haemorrhaging.<br> Due to distortion of all neural systems.<br> Dissolution of autonomic nervous system.<br> All basic personality factors, captain.<br> - The attack was thorough.<br> - What did the others die of? Each had a different centre of brain destroyed, cause unknown.<br> A different centre of the brain, you say? Yes, captain.<br> I can be more detailed when we return to the ship.<br> Use the ship's computers.<br> Mira.<br> The captain has some questions.<br> - Yes, captain? - Lieutenant.<br> When you were unconscious, you were speaking.<br> What did I say? I don't know.<br> The words were unfamiliar to me.<br> What did it sound like? They sounded exactly like the last words spoken by the technician.<br> What technician? We found one person in there, just barely alive.<br> - The rest were dead and we - Lieutenant.<br> - Lieutenant? - We must get back to the ship.<br> - Why? Tell me, why? - That storm, it's returning.<br> - How do you know? - I know.<br> You'll be killed if we stay.<br> Lieutenant, I assure you, that unexplained phenomenon was headed away from the planet.<br> - It is probably seeking other victims.<br> - I tell you, it will kill us.<br> - Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Bridge, sir.<br> The storm has reappeared on the long-range scanner and is closing fast.<br> - What's its course? - Coming back in this direction.<br> Beam us up.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, this is the captain.<br> Get the Enterprise out of here.<br> Wait, captain, we've lost Mira.<br> - Delay that order, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Stabilise her.<br> Something's interfering.<br> I have her coordinates, but she is suspended in transit.<br> Let me.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Sulu, get us out of here.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, check emergency manual monitor for transporter control.<br> Captain, it's changing course.<br> Plot the new course, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> - Present course is 126, mark 20.<br> - Plot it.<br> Present course will bring it across our starboard side, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, you made a statement that phenomenon is not a storm.<br> Explain.<br> No known conditions in space would support that type of natural phenomenon.<br> - What is it? - I'm having difficulty with the sensors.<br> They seem to be under selective attack by the phenomenon as the unfortunate occupants of Memory Alpha were.<br> Then deductive reasoning has to be substituted.<br> Ship's sensors are operating at the moment.<br> Perhaps the elusive creature will now reveal something about itself.<br> But I saw those men dead, in their exact positions.<br> Listen to me.<br> I've told you what strange tricks a space trip can play on your mind.<br> - Now, that's all it is.<br> - No, Scotty.<br> Have you ever had visions of the future events before this? - Never.<br> - And if you ask me, nobody ever has.<br> That seeing of the future, it's pure bunk.<br> You know that, don't you? - I've always believed it.<br> - And you were perfectly right.<br> Then what is it, Scotty? What's frightening me? Ever since that storm hit, I've had such strange thoughts, such feelings of terror.<br> It's space.<br> Space.<br> That's all it is.<br> Then I don't have to report it? Well, if you want to spend the rest of the trip in Sickbay.<br> But what good would that do? Dr.<br> McCoy can no more cure it than he can a cold.<br> Captain, it's heading straight for us.<br> - Activate shields.<br> - Shields activated.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, change course to 143, mark 3.<br> - One-four-three, mark 3.<br> - Storm's course, Mr.<br> Sulu? One-four-three, mark 3.<br> - Take evasive action.<br> - Evasive action.<br> Hard starboard, 217, mark 5.<br> Two-one-seven, mark 5.<br> Still with us, sir.<br> Hard port, 117, mark 2.<br> One-one-seven, mark 2.<br> Still with us, sir.<br> Is it closing? Negative, captain.<br> Maintaining its distance.<br> However, it is matching each manoeuvre we execute and I am receiving increasing magnitude of energy.<br> Your analysis, Spock? What is it? Not what is it, captain.<br> What are they? There are ten distinct life units within it, all powerfully alive and vital.<br> Who are they? Where are they from? Lmpossible to determine without programming for computer analysis.<br> It's clear we can't outrun them.<br> Can we shield against them? I do not believe the Enterprise shields would prove an effective defence.<br> There must be some defence we can use.<br> Captain, we are dealing with a community of life units.<br> Their attack is in the form of brainwaves directed against the brain which is most compatible.<br> Maybe we can avoid another attack.<br> Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels.<br> Tie in the universal translator.<br> Mr.<br> Spock says it's alive.<br> Maybe I can talk to it.<br> All channels open.<br> Translator tied in.<br> This is Captain James Kirk of the USS Enterprise.<br> We wish you no harm.<br> Physical contact between us is fatal to our life forms.<br> Please, do not come any closer to our ship.<br> Perhaps it did not understand.<br> Captain, change in velocity recorded.<br> They're passing our starboard side and moving in front of us.<br> Switching to forward scanner.<br> Captain, change in velocity recorded.<br> It has accelerated its approach.<br> Help, Scotty.<br> Hold me.<br> It's happening again.<br> No! Mira Perhaps it understands another kind of language.<br> Condition Red Alert.<br> Prepare for phaser firing.<br> - Mira.<br> - No, Scotty! No! - Lock in phaser tracking controls.<br> - Locked in, sir.<br> Adjust phasers, we'll fire across its course.<br> Do not hit it.<br> - Locked in, sir.<br> - Fire.<br> Reaction, Mr.<br> Sulu? None, sir.<br> They're still approaching us.<br> Apparently a shot across the bow is insufficiently convincing.<br> Prepare to lock phasers into the heart of the community.<br> - Locked in, sir.<br> - Fire.<br> Scotty! Mira! Mira.<br> The phasers seem to have stopped their approach.<br> They're holding position.<br> Lock in for another blast.<br> - Locked in, sir.<br> - Captain! Captain, the phaser shots are killing Mira! Killing Lieutenant Romaine? When you fired the phasers, they stunned her and she crumpled.<br> Another shot and you'll kill her.<br> Get her to Sickbay at once.<br> Ready for firing, captain.<br> Cancel that order.<br> Another attack on that alien life form will kill Lieutenant Romaine.<br> - It appears so.<br> - If she is to survive, we can't attack.<br> Not directly.<br> Can the computer supply a defence based on the data you've been accumulating? Negative, captain.<br> I have not been able to gather sufficient data for that.<br> Captain, there is only one possible defence.<br> If we can find an environment which is deadly to the alien form.<br> And yet isolate the girl from its deadly effects.<br> - Captain Kirk to Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> Is the girl well enough to be questioned? I can have her ready in a few minutes.<br> Have the lieutenant and Mr.<br> Scott in the briefing room as quickly as possible.<br> Bring all available biographical material with you.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, come with me.<br> Go easy on her, Jim.<br> She's in a pretty bad state.<br> I'll try.<br> Lieutenant Romaine.<br> I didn't mean to be uncooperative, doctor.<br> Of course you didn't.<br> I told the captain.<br> We must get to understand what is happening.<br> I'll tell you everything I know.<br> The ship's investigative procedures are sometimes confusing to a new crewman.<br> - Don't let us upset you.<br> - I trust all of you implicitly.<br> I want to help.<br> This investigation has been prompted by two events.<br> First is the time you passed out on the Bridge and the second is when we fired our main phasers into that force that is attacking us and seriously injured you.<br> - You mustn't worry about hurting me.<br> - Now, this is how we'll proceed.<br> Mr.<br> Spock has all the information available to us about our attackers.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has access to Starfleet's exhaustive files on you.<br> A comparison of the two may turn up some improbable connection, which may protect you and ourselves.<br> All right, gentlemen? Dr.<br> McCoy, will you proceed? Romaine, Mira, lieutenant.<br> Place of birth, Martian Colony Number 3.<br> Parents, Lydia Romaine, deceased.<br> Jacques Romaine, chief engineer of Starfleet, retired.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, are you prepared with the background history of the attackers? I am, captain.<br> I have fed all obtainable data to the main computer.<br> It should be ready to supply whatever conclusions are possible.<br> Thank you.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, what is the status of our friends up there? Status unchanged.<br> They're still with us and keeping the same distance.<br> Continue evasive manoeuvres.<br> Keep me informed.<br> Kirk out.<br> Doctor, do you have a medical record of Lieutenant Romaine available? Yes, captain.<br> I'd like a few items from her psychological profile checked.<br> Any history of psychosomatic illness? Occasional, in teenage routine incidents.<br> Any evidence of involuntary or unconscious telepathic abilities? None.<br> Any pathological or unusual empathic responses? No, captain, not empathic.<br> However, an extremely flexible and pliant response to new learning situations is highly marked.<br> - Go ahead, doctor.<br> - Right after our phasers hit that thing, I gave Lieutenant Romaine a standard Steinman analysis.<br> - The results might be interesting.<br> - Go ahead.<br> A comparison of our Steinman with Starfleet records shows that Lieutenant Romaine's fingerprints, voice analysis, all external factors remain exactly the same as before.<br> However, according to two hyperencephalograms, her brainwave pattern has been altered.<br> - But that's impossible.<br> - That's what I was taught.<br> But the BCP is just as consistent as fingerprints.<br> Let's see it.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, according to your records, Lieutenant Romaine showed no abnormal telepathic powers.<br> That's right, Spock, but exceptional pliancy was indicated.<br> That might be a factor.<br> And you are sure that this is the correct slide? Yes, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> That is Tape Deck D, brain circuitry pattern of Lieutenant Mira Romaine.<br> Gentlemen, it also happens to be Tape H, the impulse tracking obtained from the alien life units.<br> Nurse Chapel followed this every step of the way.<br> There can be no error.<br> Check it, Spock.<br> As I said, captain, this is the tracking obtained during the last shielded run.<br> Computer, run a detailed comparison, brain circuitry patterns, Tape D and Tape H.<br> Comparison Tape D, brain circuitry patterns of Lieutenant Mira Romaine and Tape H, brain circuitry patterns of alien life unit.<br> Identical.<br> Identical.<br> Fascinating.<br> - There has been no error.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy is correct, captain.<br> There is an identity of minds taking place between the alien beings and the mind of Lieutenant Romaine.<br> Their thoughts are becoming hers.<br> Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> The alien is no longer maintaining its distance.<br> Continue evasive action.<br> Keep me informed.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mira has tried to tell me all along that she was seeing things in advance.<br> Why didn't you report it? You don't report space sickness.<br> That's all I thought it was.<br> - What did she see? - The first attack on the ship.<br> The attack on Memory Alpha, and the time we nearly lost her.<br> Those were all acts carried out by our attacker.<br> And And Yes, Scotty.<br> What else? I thought for a moment there was something else, but I guess I was wrong.<br> - Was he wrong, Lieutenant? - Yes, there was one other time.<br> - What did you see? - I saw Scotty.<br> Where? - I don't know.<br> - What was he doing? He was dying.<br> Now I understand what's been happening.<br> I've been seeing through another mind.<br> I've been flooded with thoughts, not my own, that control me.<br> Oh, Scotty, Scotty, I'd rather die than hurt you.<br> I'd rather die.<br> All right, now.<br> What's all this talk of dying? They've called the turn on us three out of four times.<br> Now, that's a better average than anybody deserves.<br> It's our turn now.<br> We'll fight them.<br> So let's not hear anything more about dying.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Sulu, captain.<br> All evasion tactics carried out as ordered.<br> - What success did you have? - It's been useless, captain.<br> At their present force, they will get through the shields this time, captain.<br> - Warp 8, Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> They'll be here very soon.<br> They may destroy you and us as they did Memory Alpha.<br> You are especially susceptible to their will.<br> But we have one chance to survive.<br> Don't resist.<br> Let them begin to function through you.<br> If we can control that moment, we have a chance.<br> Will you try? Tell me what to do.<br> - Captain Kirk to Medical Lab.<br> - Medical Lab here, sir.<br> Prepare the antigrav test units.<br> Let's go.<br> Attention, all personnel, attention.<br> Alien force has penetrated the ship.<br> Take defensive action.<br> Attention, all personnel.<br> The alien being has penetrated the ship.<br> Take defensive action.<br> General quarters, Security Condition 3, intruder alert.<br> Repeat, general quarters, Security Condition 3, intruder alert.<br> As soon as she has entered the gravity chamber, secure all ports.<br> Don't touch me, Scotty.<br> Stay away.<br> We've lost her to them.<br> - Stay where you are.<br> - She could kill us all in this state.<br> She will, unless we are able to complete what the captain has planned.<br> Stay with us, Mira.<br> Please stay.<br> I'm trying.<br> I want to be with you.<br> They are too strong.<br> Don't lose yourself to them.<br> Hold on.<br> I am Mira Romaine.<br> I will be who I choose to be.<br> I will Stay away, Scotty! They're with me.<br> They will kill you.<br> You won't let them.<br> She cannot stop us.<br> You cannot prevent it.<br> Mira.<br> Mira! Captain.<br> That's not Mira talking.<br> Captain, we must deal with them directly.<br> Now, while she still retains partial identity, we can speak to them.<br> They will answer using her voice.<br> I'm Captain James Kirk of the spaceship Enterprise.<br> Do you understand? Yes, we understand you.<br> We have searched for a millennium for one through whom we can see and speak and hear and live out our lives.<br> - Who are you? - We are from Zetar.<br> That is one of the planets where all humanoid life was destroyed.<br> You can't be from Zetar.<br> All life was destroyed there long ago.<br> - Yes, all corporeal life was destroyed.<br> - Then what are you? The desires, the hopes, the mind and the will of the last hundred of Zetar.<br> The force of our life could not be wiped out.<br> - All things die.<br> - At the proper time.<br> Our planet was dying.<br> We were determined to live on.<br> At the peak of our plans to go, a sudden final disaster struck us down.<br> But the force of our lives survived.<br> At last we have found someone through whom we can live it out.<br> The body of the one you inhabit has its own life to lead.<br> She will accept ours.<br> She will not.<br> She is fighting for her own identity.<br> Her mind will accept our thoughts.<br> Our lives will be fulfilled.<br> Will she learn the way the people on Memory Alpha learned? - We did not wish to kill.<br> - But you did kill.<br> No.<br> Resisting us killed those people.<br> We did not kill them.<br> The price of your survival is too high.<br> We only want the girl.<br> You can't have her.<br> You're entitled to your own life, but not another's.<br> Life was given to me.<br> It is mine.<br> I want to live it out.<br> I will The girl's life reading is becoming a match to the Zetarians'.<br> She's losing.<br> Do not fight us.<br> They will not accept their own deaths.<br> They'll be forced to accept it.<br> You will all die.<br> Captain, if we cannot complete the plan, they will carry out their threat.<br> We must get her into the pressure chamber.<br> Jim, you realise the pressure needed to kill the Zetars might kill the girl, too.<br> Mira will not kill me.<br> Told you she wouldn't kill me.<br> Secure the chamber.<br> Neutralise the gravity.<br> The Zetars are growing stronger.<br> A weightless state has become their natural condition.<br> Pressurise the unit.<br> Bring pressure up to two atmospheres and then increase one atmosphere per second.<br> Continue increasing pressure.<br> Pressure, Spock.<br> Pressure.<br> The pressure is dangerously high, captain.<br> It may damage her.<br> Continue, Spock.<br> Pressure.<br> We've done it, Jim.<br> They're gone.<br> It's all right, Mira.<br> They're gone.<br> They're gone.<br> Reduce the pressure very, very gradually, Spock.<br> We may tax Mr.<br> Scott's patience, doctor.<br> Now, lie perfectly still, lieutenant.<br> Try not to move at all.<br> Take deep, regular breaths.<br> But don't hold it.<br> Continue to breathe deeply.<br> In out in out.<br> That's it.<br> Now, you'll be in there another 20 minutes, so why don't you just try to relax.<br> Now we have all the time in the world.<br> Bones, are you able to judge the long-range effects on Lieutenant Romaine? When the personality of a human is involved, exact predictions are hazardous.<br> Particularly where humans are involved, doctor.<br> However, despite Starfleet judgement of the pliancy of the lieutenant, she put up a valiant struggle to retain her identity and I find that encouraging.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is correct, captain.<br> While the truth was difficult to accept, when it was revealed, the girl reacted well.<br> I would say her struggle in this experience would strengthen her entire ego structure.<br> Would either of you credit Scotty's steadfast belief in her as a factor? You mean love as motivation? Humans do claim a great deal for that particular emotion.<br> I suppose it is possible.<br> However There are no howevers about it, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> It was a factor and it will be a factor in her recovery.<br> Do I take it both of you agree that Lieutenant Romaine need not return to starbase for further treatment? Well, I should think work would be a better therapy.<br> Logical.<br> - Captain Kirk to Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Scott here, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, how's Lieutenant Romaine? - Beautiful, captain.<br> - Yes, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Do I take it you say that she is fit for duty? - Positively, captain.<br> - Thank you.<br> - Kirk to Bridge.<br> - Sulu, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, set course for Memory Alpha.<br> Lieutenant Romaine has a lot of work to do there.<br> Well, this is an Enterprise first.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, Mr.<br> Spock and Engineer Scott find themselves in complete agreement.<br> Can I stand the strain?   <br>\n                </div>",

My retreat from the unpleasantness of life on Earth and the company of people.<br> Mr.<br> Flint, I have a sick crew up there.<br> We can't possibly reach another planet in time.<br> You can't refuse us the ryetalyn.<br> You're trespassing, captain.<br> We're in need.<br> We'll pay for it, work for it, trade for it.<br> - You have nothing I want.<br> - But you have the ryetalyn we need.<br> If necessary, we'll take it.<br> If you do not leave voluntarily, I have the power to force you to leave.<br> Or kill you where you stand.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, lock phasers onto our coordinates.<br> Aye, captain.<br> All phasers locked on.<br> Mr.<br> Flint, if anything happens to us, four deaths, and then my crew comes down and takes that ryetalyn.<br> An interesting test of power.<br> Your enormous forces against mine.<br> Who would win? Mr.<br> Flint, unless you are certain, I would suggest you refrain from a most useless experiment.<br> We need only a few hours.<br> Have you seen a victim of Rigelian fever? They die in one day.<br> The effects are like bubonic plague.<br> Constantinople, summer, 1334.<br> It marched through the streets, the sewers.<br> It left the city by oxcart, by sea, to kill half of Europe.<br> The rats, rustling and squealing in the night, as they too died.<br> - The rats.<br> - Are you a student of history, sir? I am.<br> The Enterprise, a plague ship.<br> You have two hours, at the end of which time, you will leave.<br> With all due gratitude.<br> M-4 will gather the ryetalyn which you need.<br> Permit me to offer you more comfortable surroundings.<br> Come in, gentlemen.<br> Our ship sensors did not reveal your presence here, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> My planet is surrounded by screens which create the impression of lifelessness.<br> A protection against the curious, the uninvited.<br> Then you live here alone.<br> Except for M-4, which serves as butler, housekeeper, gardener and guardian.<br> A most impressive home, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> Yes.<br> A Shakespeare first folio, a Gutenberg bible.<br> Creation lithographs by Taranullus of Centauri Vll.<br> That's one of the rarest book collections in the galaxy, spanning centuries.<br> Be comfortable, gentlemen.<br> Help yourselves to brandy.<br> Do we trust him? It would seem logical to do so for the moment.<br> Well, I'll need two hours to process that ryetalyn into antitoxin.<br> If that ryetalyn isn't here in one hour, we'll go prospecting, right over Mr.<br> Flint, if necessary.<br> This is the most splendid private collection of art I've ever seen.<br> And the most unique.<br> The majority are the works of Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance period.<br> Some of the works of Reginald Pollack, 20th century.<br> And even a Sten from Marcus II.<br> At last I've seen other humans.<br> - Other men.<br> - One is not human.<br> The Vulcan.<br> So that is a Vulcan.<br> I would like to discuss subdimensional physics with him.<br> You've taught me all you know in the area and you say Vulcans know more.<br> Even he is not your intellectual equal, nor mine.<br> - Let me meet them.<br> - They are selfish, brutal.<br> A part of the human community which I rejected and from which I've shielded you.<br> Soon they will be gone.<br> Let me meet them.<br> Rayna, have you been lonely? What is loneliness? It is a thirst.<br> It is a flower dying in the desert.<br> Flint, don't take this opportunity away from me.<br> It's so exciting.<br> Exciting? You have never made a demand of me before.<br> I'm sorry.<br> Don't be sorry.<br> It might be interesting.<br> - Saurian brandy, 100 years old.<br> Jim? - Please.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I know you won't have one.<br> Heaven forbid those mathematically perfect brainwaves be corrupted by this all-too-human vice.<br> Thank you, doctor.<br> I will have a brandy.<br> Do you think the two of us can handle a drunk Vulcan? Once alcohol hits that green blood If I appear distracted, it is because of what I've seen.<br> I am close to experiencing an unaccustomed emotion.<br> I'll drink to that.<br> - What emotion? - Envy.<br> None of these da Vinci paintings has ever been catalogued or reproduced.<br> They are unknown works, all apparently authentic, to the last brushstroke and use of materials.<br> As undiscovered da Vincis, they would be priceless.<br> Would be? You mean you think they're fakes? Most strange.<br> A man of Flint's obvious wealth and impeccable taste scarcely needs to hang fakes.<br> Yet my tricorder analysis indicates that the canvas and pigments used are of contemporary origin.<br> Well, this could be what it seems to be.<br> Or it could be a cover, a setup, or even an illusion.<br> That could explain the paintings, similar to the real thing.<br> Spock, at your earliest opportunity, take a full tricorder reading of our host, see if he's human.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott? - Aye, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, run a full computer check on Mr.<br> Flint and on this planet, Holberg 917-G.<br> Stand by with your results.<br> I'll contact.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Kirk out.<br> Well, let's enjoy this brandy.<br> It tastes real.<br> Easy.<br> Bones? Ryetalyn, ready to be processed into antitoxin.<br> Beam up to the ship and start processing.<br> That will not be necessary, captain.<br> M-4 can prepare the ryetalyn for inoculation more quickly in my laboratory than you could aboard your ship.<br> I would like to supervise that, of course.<br> And when you are satisfied as to procedures, I hope you will do me the honour of being my guests at dinner.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> I don't think we have the time.<br> I regret my earlier inhospitality.<br> Let me make amends.<br> Gentlemen, may I present Rayna.<br> I thought you lived alone.<br> I meant there are no others besides my family.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I do hope we can find a moment to discuss field density and its relationship to gravity phenomena.<br> Indeed.<br> I would appreciate such a talk.<br> It is an interest of mine.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> - Captain Kirk? - Rayna.<br> Her parents were killed in an accident while in my employ.<br> Before dying, they placed their infant, Rayna Kapec, in my custody.<br> - I have raised and educated her.<br> - With most impressive results, sir.<br> What else interests you besides gravity phenomena, Rayna? Everything.<br> Less than that is betrayal of the intellect.<br> The totality of the universe? All knowledge? Rayna possesses the equivalent of 17 university degrees in the sciences and arts.<br> She is aware that the intellect is not all.<br> But its cultivation must come first, or the individual makes errors, wastes time in unprofitable pursuits.<br> At her age, I rather enjoyed errors with no noticeable damage.<br> But, I must admit, you're the farthest thing from a bookworm I've ever seen.<br> Flint is my teacher.<br> You are the only other men I've ever seen.<br> The misfortune of men everywhere and our privilege.<br> If you will accompany my robot to the laboratory, doctor, you can rest assured that the ryetalyn is being processed.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> Your pleasure, gentlemen? Chess, billiards, conversation? Why not all three? - Did you teach her that? - We play often.<br> May I show you, captain? You said savagery, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> When was the last time you visited Earth? You would tell me that it is no longer cruel.<br> But it is, captain.<br> Look at your starship, bristling with weapons.<br> Its mission: To colonise, exploit, destroy, if necessary, to advance Federation causes.<br> Yes.<br> Thank you.<br> Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive.<br> If we were barbarians, we would not have asked for ryetalyn.<br> Indeed, your greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence.<br> The result of pressures which are not your concern.<br> Yes, well, most pressures are everywhere, in everyone, urging him to what you call savagery.<br> The private hells, the inner needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct.<br> As human beings, that is the way it is.<br> To be human is to be complex.<br> You can't avoid a little ugliness from within and from without.<br> Why don't you play the waltz, Mr.<br> Spock? To be human is also to seek pleasure, to laugh, to dance.<br> Rayna is a most accomplished dancer.<br> - May I have the pleasure? - Thank you.<br> - Is there something wrong? - Yes, the ryetalyn is no good.<br> It contains irillium, nearly one part per thousand.<br> Irillium will render the antitoxin inert and useless.<br> Most unfortunate that it was not detected.<br> I shall go with M-4 to gather more ryetalyn and screen it myself.<br> - You're welcome to join me, doctor.<br> - Thank you.<br> Time factor, Bones, epidemic.<br> Nearly two and a half hours.<br> I guess we got time to get in under the wire.<br> Never seen anything like the speed of that robot.<br> It'd take us twice as long to process that stuff.<br> But would we have made the error? Jim, what if all the ryetalyn on this planet contains irillium? Go with Flint.<br> Keep an eye on procedures.<br> Like a hawk.<br> Captain, something else which is rather extraordinary.<br> This waltz I just played is by Johannes Brahms.<br> - Later, Spock.<br> - Captain, it is written in manuscript.<br> In original manuscript in Brahms' own hand, which I recognise.<br> It is totally unknown, definitely the work of Brahms, and yet, unknown.<br> I think I will go to the laboratory.<br> There may be a way of reversing the irillium's effect and saving the existing antitoxin.<br> Stay here.<br> Let me know when Flint and McCoy return.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5843.<br>75.<br> Have I committed a grave error in accepting Flint's word that he would deliver the antidote to us? The precious time I have let pass may result in disaster for the Enterprise and her crew.<br> You left us.<br> The room became lonely.<br> It is a thirst.<br> A flower dying in the desert.<br> What? - What's in there? - I do not know.<br> Flint told me never to enter.<br> - He denies me nothing else.<br> - Then why are you here? I do not know.<br> I come here when I am troubled.<br> When I would search myself.<br> Are you troubled now? Yes.<br> By what? Are you happy here with Flint? He is the greatest, kindest, wisest man in the galaxy.<br> Then why are you afraid? Don't be afraid.<br> Stop command.<br> Stop.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Fortunately, the robot did not detect my presence and deactivate my phaser.<br> M-4 was programmed to defend this household and its members.<br> No doubt I should have altered its instructions to allow for unauthorized but predictable actions on your part.<br> It thought you were attacking Rayna.<br> A misinterpretation.<br> If it were around right now, it would correct Too useful a device to be without, really.<br> I created another.<br> It will now go to the laboratory and join Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - Fascinating.<br> - Be thankful you did not attack me.<br> I might have accepted battle and I have twice your physical strength.<br> In your own words, it would be \"an interesting test of power.<br>\" How childish he is, Rayna.<br> Would you call him brave or a fool? I'm glad you did not die.<br> Of course.<br> Death, when unnecessary, is a tragic thing.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is in the laboratory with the new ryetalyn.<br> He's satisfied as to its quality.<br> May I suggest that you wait here, patiently, safely? You have seen that my defence systems operate automatically, and not always in accordance with my wishes.<br> Come, Rayna.<br> Rayna.<br> Come.<br> I don't like the way he orders her around.<br> Since we are dependent on Mr.<br> Flint for the ryetalyn, captain, may I respectfully suggest that you pay less attention to the young lady if you should encounter her again.<br> Our host's interests do not appear to be confined to art and science.<br> He loves her? Strongly indicated.<br> Jealousy.<br> Yes.<br> That would explain the attack, but he seemed to want us together.<br> The billiard game.<br> He suggested we dance.<br> It does appear to defy the male logic, as I understand it.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Aye, captain.<br> Report on the Rigelian fever.<br> Nearly everybody aboard has got it, captain.<br> We're working a skeleton crew and waiting for the ryetalyn.<br> Just a little while longer, Scotty.<br> Report on the computer search.<br> There's no report on Mr.<br> Flint.<br> He doesn't seem to have any past.<br> The planet was purchased a wealthy financier and recluse.<br> Run a computer check on Rayna Kapec.<br> Status, legal ward after the death of her parents.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Kirk out.<br> We have still a greater mystery, captain.<br> I was able to run a tricorder scan on Mr.<br> Flint.<br> He is human, but there are certain biophysical peculiarities.<br> Some body function readings are disproportionate.<br> For one thing, extreme age is indicated, on the order of 6000 years.<br> Can you confirm that, Mr.<br> Spock? I shall program the readings through Dr.<br> McCoy's medical computer - when we return to the ship.<br> - Time factor? We must commence ryetalyn injections within two hours and 18 minutes or the epidemic will prove fatal to us all.<br> What's keeping the processing this time? The delay may be deliberate.<br> As though he was keeping us here for some reason.<br> Most interesting.<br> Our host appears to wish us to linger, yet he is apprehensive.<br> It is logical to assume that we are being monitored and that he is aware of our every move.<br> You sent the robot to kill him.<br> It came to protect you.<br> My mind could not have summoned it.<br> I was not frightened.<br> It was defective, then.<br> I would have destroyed it myself.<br> Have I lied to you? Never.<br> Believe what I say.<br> I would not want Captain Kirk dead.<br> What did you feel? - You'll let them have the ryetalyn? - Yes.<br> Go to them if you wish.<br> Say your farewells.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, sir.<br> There's no record of a Rayna Kapec in Federation legal banks.<br> No award of custody? No background at all in any computer banks.<br> Like Flint.<br> Kirk out.<br> \"Like Flint.<br>\" People without a past.<br> What hold does he have over her? Captain, I would suggest that our immediate concern is the ryetalyn.<br> Let's find McCoy.<br> Captain? I'll meet you in the lab.<br> I've come to say goodbye.<br> I don't want to say goodbye.<br> A last tender encounter, Captain Kirk, to end your usefulness.<br> I tell you, Spock, I was waiting for the robot to finish the processing and the next thing I knew, it was gone and so was the ryetalyn.<br> Interesting.<br> Obviously Mr.<br> Flint is not yet ready for us to depart.<br> - Well, I think we better tell Jim.<br> - The captain wanted us to wait here.<br> Come with me.<br> I offer you happiness.<br> I've known security here.<br> Childhood must end.<br> You love me, not Flint.<br> Flint lied.<br> The ryetalyn isn't here.<br> Picking up tricorder readings, captain.<br> Apparently the ryetalyn is behind this door.<br> Why is Flint playing tricks on us? Apparently we're supposed to go in and get it.<br> If we can.<br> Let's not disappoint the chess master.<br> Phasers on full.<br> Captain, I shall get the ryetalyn.<br> - Why you? - There may be dangers within.<br> - Let's find out.<br> - Let me go alone, captain.<br> Why? Get to the point, Spock, if there is one.<br> We'll all go.<br> The ryetalyn.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5843.<br>8.<br> We have accomplished our mission and have the ryetalyn ready to combat the epidemic aboard the Enterprise.<br> But we have also discovered our benefactor's secret.<br> He has created the perfect woman.<br> Her only flaw: She's not human.<br> Physically human, but not human.<br> These are earlier versions of Rayna, Jim.<br> She's an android.<br> Created here by my hand.<br> Here the centuries of loneliness were to end.<br> Your collection of Leonardo da Vinci masterpieces, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> They appear to have been recently painted on contemporary canvas with contemporary materials.<br> And on your piano, a waltz by Johannes Brahms.<br> An unknown work, in manuscript, written in modern ink.<br> Yet absolutely authentic, as are your paintings.<br> I am Brahms.<br> - And da Vinci? - Yes.<br> How many other names shall we call you? Solomon, Alexander, Lazarus, Methuselah, Merlin, Abramson.<br> A hundred other names you do not know.<br> - You were born? - In that region of Earth later called Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 B.<br>C.<br>, as the millennia are reckoned.<br> I was Akharin.<br> A soldier, a bully and a fool.<br> I fell in battle, pierced to the heart, and did not die.<br> Instant tissue regeneration coupled with some perfect form of biological renewal.<br> - You learned that you're immortal.<br> - And to conceal it.<br> To live some portion of a life.<br> To pretend to age and then move on before my nature was suspected.<br> Your wealth and your intellect are the product of centuries of acquisition.<br> You knew the greatest minds in history.<br> Galileo, Socrates, Moses.<br> I have married a hundred times, captain.<br> Selected, loved, cherished, caressed a smoothness, inhaled a brief fragrance.<br> Then age, death, the taste of dust.<br> Do you understand? You wanted a perfect, ultimate woman.<br> As brilliant, as immortal, as yourself.<br> Your mate for all time.<br> Designed by my heart.<br> I could not love her more.<br> Spock, you knew? I had hoped I was wrong.<br> You cannot love an android, captain.<br> I love her.<br> She is my handiwork, my property.<br> She is what I desire.<br> You brought me here to learn this? - Does she know? - She will never know.<br> - Let's go.<br> - You will stay.<br> - Why? - We have discovered what he is.<br> If you leave, the curious would follow.<br> The foolish, the meddlers, the officials, the seekers.<br> My privacy was my own.<br> Its invasion be on your head.<br> We can remain silent.<br> The disaster of intervention, Spock, I've known it.<br> I will not risk it.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Clear out of the area.<br> Inform Starfleet Command Enterprise? Scotty? They cannot answer, captain.<br> My crew.<br> The test of power.<br> You had no chance.<br> It is time for you to join your crew.<br> You'd wipe out 400 lives? Why? I have seen 100 billion fall.<br> I know death better than any man.<br> I have tossed enemies into his grasp.<br> And I know mercy.<br> Your crew is not dead, but suspended.<br> Worse than dead.<br> Restore them.<br> Restore my ship.<br> In time.<br> A thousand, 2000 years.<br> You will know the future, Captain Kirk.<br> You have been such men.<br> You've known and created such beauty.<br> You've watched your race evolve from cruelty and barbarism throughout your enormous life and yet now you would do this to us? The flowers of my past.<br> I hold the nettles of the present.<br> - I am Flint now, with my needs.<br> - What needs? Tonight, I've seen something wondrous, something I've waited for, laboured for.<br> Nothing must endanger it.<br> At last Rayna's emotions have stirred to life.<br> Now they will turn to me in this solitude which I preserve.<br> No.<br> Rayna.<br> - You must not do this to them.<br> - I must.<br> What will you feel for him after we are gone? All emotions are in play, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> You harm us, she hates you.<br> Give me back my ship.<br> Your secret is safe with us.<br> That's why you delayed the processing of the ryetalyn.<br> You realised what was happening.<br> You kept us together, Rayna and me.<br> Because you knew I could bring her emotions alive.<br> And now you're just going to take over? I shall take what is mine, when she comes to me.<br> We are mated, captain.<br> Alike, immortal.<br> We must forget your feelings in this matter, which is impossible for you.<br> Impossible.<br> Impossible.<br> From the beginning, you used me.<br> I can't love her.<br> But I do love her.<br> - And she loves me.<br> - No.<br> Captain, your primitive impulses - will not alter the circumstances.<br> - Stay out of this.<br> - We're fighting over a woman.<br> - No, you're not, for she is not.<br> I cannot be the cause of this.<br> I will not be the cause of this.<br> Please, stop.<br> Stop.<br> I choose where I want to go.<br> What I want to do.<br> I choose.<br> I choose.<br> - Rayna.<br> - No.<br> Do not order me.<br> No one can order me.<br> She's human.<br> Down to the last blood cell, she's human.<br> Down to the last thought, hope, aspiration, emotion, she's human.<br> The human spirit is free.<br> You have no power of ownership.<br> She's free to do as she wishes.<br> Gentlemen, I urge you to stop.<br> There is a danger.<br> No man beats me.<br> I don't want to beat you.<br> This is no test of power.<br> Rayna belongs to herself.<br> And she claims the human right of choice, to be as she wills.<br> To do as she wills, to think as she wills.<br> That's what I have worked for.<br> Rayna, come with me.<br> Stay.<br> I was not human.<br> Now I love.<br> I love.<br> You can't die.<br> - What happened? - She loved you, captain.<br> And you too, Mr.<br> Flint.<br> As a mentor, even as a father.<br> There was not enough time for her to adjust to the awful power and contradictions of her new-found emotions.<br> She could not bear to hurt either of you.<br> The joys of love made her human and the agonies of love destroyed her.<br> Spock.<br> The epidemic is reduced and no longer a threat.<br> The Enterprise is on course 513, mark 7, as you ordered.<br> A very old and lonely man.<br> And a young and lonely man.<br> We put on a pretty poor show, didn't we? If only I could forget.<br> Jim Thank heaven.<br> Sleeping at last.<br> Your report, doctor.<br> Oh, those tricorder readings on Mr.<br> Flint are finally correlated.<br> He's dying.<br> You see, Flint, in leaving Earth, with all of its complex fields within which he was formed, sacrificed immortality.<br> He'll live the remainder of a normal life span, then die.<br> On that day, I shall mourn.<br> - Does he know? - Yes, I told him myself.<br> He intends to devote the remainder of his years and great abilities to the improvement of the human condition.<br> And who knows what he might come up with? Indeed.<br> Well, I guess that's all.<br> I can tell Jim later or you can.<br> Considering his opponent's longevity, truly an eternal triangle.<br> You wouldn't understand that, would you, Spock? You see, I feel sorrier for you than I do for him.<br> Because you'll never know the things that love can drive a man to.<br> The ecstasies, the miseries, the broken rules, the desperate chances, the glorious failures and the glorious victories.<br> All of these things you'll never know simply because the word \"love\" isn't written into your book.<br> Good night, Spock.<br> Good night, doctor.<br> I do wish he could forget her.<br> Forget.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Yes.<br> A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics, communications, and electronics on Tiburon.<br> He was dismissed from his post when he started this movement.<br> Tong Rad inherits his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space studies.<br> But they've rejected all that and all that this technology provides.<br> And they seek the primitive.<br> There are many who are uncomfortable with what we have created.<br> It is almost a biological rebellion.<br> A profound revulsion against the planned communities, the programming, the sterilized, artfully-balanced atmospheres.<br> They hunger for an Eden where spring comes.<br> We all do.<br> The cave is deep in our memory.<br> Yes, that is true, captain.<br> But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible children.<br> What makes you so sympathetic toward them? It is not sympathy, so much as curiosity, captain.<br> A wish to understand.<br> They regard themselves as aliens in their own worlds, a condition with which I am somewhat familiar.<br> Spock.<br> What does Herbert mean? It is somewhat uncomplimentary, captain.<br> Herbert was a minor official notorious for his rigid and limited patterns of thought.<br> Well, I shall try to be less rigid in my thinking.<br> Lookin' for the good land Goin' astray Don't cry, don't cry Oh, I can't have honey And I can't have cream Gonna live, not die Gonna live, not die Stand in the middle of it all one day Look at it shinin' all around me And say I'm here! I'm here In the good land In the new land I'm here Excuse me.<br> Is Irina Galliulin with you? She's getting her physical.<br> Gonna crack my knuckles and jump for joy, I got a clean bill of health from Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> - You know Irina? - Say, tell me.<br> Why do you wear all those clothes? How do you breathe? You're next.<br> - Irina.<br> - Pavel Andreievich.<br> I had thought we might encounter each other.<br> - You knew I was on the Enterprise? - I had heard.<br> Irina, why.<br>.<br>? Come.<br> How could you do this to yourself? You were a scientist.<br> And now look at you.<br> Look at yourself, Pavel.<br> - Why did you do it? - Why did you? I'm proud of what I am.<br> I believe in what I do.<br> - Can you say that? - Yes.<br> Oh, we should not tear at each other so, Pavel.<br> We should meet again in joy.<br> Today when I first knew it was your ship that followed us, I thought of you and wondered what I would find.<br> And I remembered so much.<br> In spite of that uniform, I still see the same Pavel I used to know.<br> Are you happy in what you do? Yes.<br> Then I accept what you do.<br> You even talk like them.<br> - Why did you go away? - It was you who went.<br> I came back to look for you.<br> I looked.<br> Where did you go? I stayed in the city.<br> With friends.<br> - You never felt as I did.<br> Never.<br> - I did.<br> You don't have it in you to feel so much.<br> Even when we were close, you weren't with me.<br> You were off, thinking of something else.<br> Why did you stay away? Because you disapproved of me.<br> Just as you do now.<br> Oh, Pavel, you have always been like this.<br> So correct.<br> And inside, the struggle not to be.<br> Give in to yourself.<br> You will be happier.<br> You'll see.<br> Go to your friends.<br> We want to see him right now.<br> We want to see him now! Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! I thought animals were kept in cages.<br> What's going on, Bones? Trouble.<br> Friend here didn't want a checkup.<br> Turns out there's a reason.<br> - I refuse to accept your findings.<br> - You don't have the choice.<br> They are the product of prejudice, not science.<br> I don't know what this man was planning on doing on a primitive planet, but assuming one did exist, I can tell you what would have happened - had he settled there.<br> - Untrue.<br> Would have been enough of those primitives left to bury their dead.<br> - Fantasy, fantasy.<br> - I wish it were.<br> There's a nasty little bug evolved in the last few years, Jim.<br> Our septic-sterilized civilisations produced it.<br> Synthococcus novae.<br> It's deadly.<br> We can immunize against it, but we haven't learned to lick all the problems yet.<br> Does he have it? What about the others? The others are clear.<br> He doesn't have it.<br> He's a carrier.<br> Remember your ancient history? Typhoid Mary? He's immune to it, as she was, but he carries the disease and spreads it to others.<br> - Is the crew in danger? - I don't know.<br> They had full-spectrum immunizations before boarding.<br> Now, my guess is that his friends have had their shots too.<br> But a regular programme of booster shots is necessary.<br> I'll have to check everyone on the ship, there could be some skips.<br> In the meantime, he should be placed in total isolation.<br> This is outrageous.<br> You're not isolating me.<br> You're imprisoning me.<br> You invent the crime, find me guilty, and sentence me.<br> Would you like to run the test yourself, doctor? You knew you were a carrier before you came aboard, didn't you? - No! - Why did you fight the examination? - It was an infringement on my rights.<br> - Put him in isolation.<br> Be ready for the objections, Jim.<br> They are a vocal lot.<br> Yes, I'm ready.<br> Kirk to security.<br> I want a guard maintained on Dr.<br> Sevrin until further notice.<br> Bones, how long before we know whether the crew has been endangered by this infection? Lt'll show in 24 hours.<br> It's a virulent strain.<br> You don't belong with them.<br> You know what we want.<br> You want it too.<br> Come, join us.<br> - How do you know what I want? - You're young.<br> Think young, brother.<br> You make it tempting.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, explain.<br> No explanation, sir.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin will be released when we think he is medically safe.<br> Stiff man puttin' my mind in jail And the judge bang the gavel and say, \"No bail\" Gonna lick his hand And wag my tail Herbert! Herbert! Herbert! Engineering to Bridge.<br> - Yes, Scotty, what is it? - Captain.<br> I just had to give one of those bare-footed what-do-you-call-thems the boot out of here.<br> He came in, bold as brass tried to incite my crew to disaffect.<br> Thank you, Scotty.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I don't seem to be able to communicate with these people.<br> Do you think you can persuade them to behave? - I shall make an attempt.<br> - Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> If it weren't for that ambassador's son, - they'd all be in the brig.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5832.<br>5.<br> The arrogance of Dr.<br> Sevrin and his followers is creating an intolerable situation aboard the Enterprise.<br> If it continues, I'll be forced to use controls which might not agree with Starfleet's suggestion that they be handled with extreme tolerance.<br> I have no influence over what they do.<br> They respect you.<br> They will listen to your reasoning.<br> For their sake, you must stop them.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin, I am in a position to help you and your group.<br> I can use the resources of the Enterprise to determine whether or not Eden actually exists and to plot its exact location.<br> I can present a case to Federation to allow you and your group to colonise that planet.<br> Neither you nor your people are at present charged with a crime.<br> However, incitement to disaffection is criminal.<br> Federation will never allow the colonization of a planet by criminals.<br> If they persist, they will be so charged and forever barred from Eden.<br> - As I have been barred? - Then you knew you were a carrier.<br> Of course I knew.<br> You've researched my life.<br> You've read the orders restricting me to travel only in areas of advanced technology because of what my body carries.<br> What I fail to understand is why you disobey those orders.<br> Because this is poison to me! This stuff you breath, this stuff you live in.<br> Shields of artificial atmosphere that we have layered about every planet.<br> The programmes in those computers that run your ship and your lives for you, they bred what my body carries.<br> That's what your science have done to me.<br> You've infected me.<br> Only the primitives can cleanse me.<br> I cannot purge myself until I am among them.<br> Only their way of living is right.<br> I must go to them.<br> Your very presence will destroy the people you seek.<br> Surely you know that.<br> I shall go to them and be one with them.<br> And together we shall build a world such as this galaxy has never seen.<br> A world.<br> A life.<br> A life.<br> So now you're gonna try to persuade me that your technologies will find a cure for me and then I'll be free to go.<br> Yes, doctor.<br> And for that reason I should persuade my friends to behave so that they too will be allowed.<br> Yes, doctor.<br> All right.<br> You send them in.<br> I'll talk to them.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin is insane.<br> I have not consulted Dr.<br> McCoy, but I have no doubt of it.<br> I'll have Bones check him out.<br> Spock, I'm sorry.<br> You had great respect for him.<br> But it does explain some of what they've done.<br> His condition does not affect my interest in the movement.<br> There is no insanity in what they seek.<br> I made a promise which I should like to keep.<br> With your permission, I must locate Eden.<br> I shall work in my quarters.<br> May I have the assistance of Mr.<br> Chekov in auxiliary control? Certainly.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, assist Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Bridge to Sickbay.<br> - McCoy here.<br> - Bones.<br> - Yes, captain.<br> I'd like to talk to you.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5832.<br>6.<br> I have asked Dr.<br> McCoy to check Starfleet medical records to verify Mr.<br> Spock's suspicion that Dr.<br> Sevrin is insane.<br> In spite of Dr.<br> Sevrin's antipathy to us, he has promised Mr.<br> Spock that he will order his disciples to conform to our rules and regulations.<br> Come in.<br> Am I crossing you? No.<br> I was just thinking Hey, brother, do you play? Is it Vulcan? Can I try it? That's now.<br> That's real now.<br> I reach that, brother.<br> I really do.<br> Give.<br> Hey, how about a session? You and us.<br> It would sound.<br> That's what I came for.<br> I wanted to ask, you know, great white captain upstairs, but he don't reach us.<br> But would he shake on a session? I mean, we want to cooperate, like you ask, so I'm asking.<br> If I understand you correctly, I believe the answer might be yes.<br> I'll spread the word.<br> Am I allowed in? Yes.<br> I have been looking for you, Pavel.<br> What room is this? Auxiliary control.<br> What's it for? Should the main control room break down or suffer damage, we can navigate the ship from here.<br> What do you want? To apologise.<br> I should not have teased you.<br> It was cruel.<br> - It does not matter.<br> - Oh, but it does.<br> It is against everything I believe in.<br> Let us not discuss your beliefs.<br> And I do not like having you angry with me.<br> Or disapproving.<br> Then why do you do such things? What are you working on? I am assisting Mr.<br> Spock in locating your Eden.<br> Now you are teasing me.<br> I am not.<br> These tapes contain star charts and we project the orbits of the various planets here.<br> By a mathematical process, we determine whether or not they are affected by other bodies not yet charted.<br> Do you know all these things? What I do not know I find out from the computer banks.<br> If I knew nothing at all, I could navigate the ship simply by studying what is stored in there.<br> They contain the sum of all human knowledge.<br> They solve our problems on navigation.<br> Of control.<br> Of life-support.<br> They tell you what to do and you do what they tell you.<br> No.<br> We use our own judgement also.<br> I could never obey a computer.<br> You could never listen to anyone.<br> You always had to be different.<br> Not different.<br> What I wanted to be.<br> There is nothing wrong in doing what you want.<br> I am not receiving, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Spock to Chekov.<br> Repeat.<br> I am not receiving.<br> I am sorry, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I was momentarily delayed.<br> His name is Sulu, specialist in weapons and navigation.<br> His hobby is botany.<br> - Can? - Can.<br> I reach Botany.<br> - It's my favourite of studies.<br> - What's yours? Vulcan.<br> Spock is practically One now.<br> Everything can be handled from auxiliary control.<br> The computers contain all the information we need.<br> - We can do it.<br> - It starts to chime.<br> - When will it? - Soon.<br> Like he said now, we should all go out and try to swing as many as possible over.<br> You suggest any special ways to swing them? Just be friendly.<br> You know how to be friendly.<br> Then they'll be friendly.<br> I'm talkin' about you I'm talkin' about me Long time back when the Galaxy was new Man found out what he had to do Found he had to eat And he found he had to drink And a long time later He found he had to think Yes, think - I'm standing here wondering.<br> - What? If a man tells another man: Out of my way He piles up trouble For himself all day But all kinds of trouble Come to an end When a man tells another man \"Be my friend\" My friend Well, what's it going to be? There's a mile-wide emptiness Between you and me Can't reach across it Hardly even see Someone ought to take a step One way or other Let's say goodbye Or let's say \"Brother\" Brother Brother Hey, out there Hey, out there Hey, out there Hey, out there - I see you - I see you - I see you - I see you Let's get together and have some fun I don't know how to do it But it's got to be done At least we know where they are and what they're doing.<br> I don't know why a young mind has to be an undisciplined one.<br> Troublemakers.<br> I used to get into a little trouble when I was that age, Scotty.<br> Didn't you? Captain, I get no response from controls.<br> We're going off course.<br> It's shorted.<br> No, it's channelled over somewhere.<br> To auxiliary control.<br> Bridge to auxiliary control.<br> Bridge to auxiliary control.<br> Captain, it seems as though someone else is running the ship.<br> That's right.<br> Someone else is running this ship.<br> I am.<br> All functions.<br> Life-support as well.<br> You cannot interfere, as I have frozen the doors to the control room.<br> I do not intend to hand over the helm to you until and unless we reach Eden.<br> And if I am in any way prevented from reaching that destination, I shall destroy this ship and all aboard.<br> - Can he do it? - He has the capability, captain.<br> He's got everything channelled over.<br> Start a trace-back on all circuits.<br> - See if you can bypass him.<br> - Do that and I shall retaliate.<br> I shall not warn you again.<br> Captain, we're now leaving the Neutral Zone.<br> Bearing into Romulan space.<br> Any patrols? - Negative.<br> - There will be soon.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin, you are violating Romulan space and endangering the peace of the galaxy.<br> The Romulans will view this as a military intrusion and attack.<br> Bring the ship about now.<br> If you bring her about and return to starbase, no charges will be levelled.<br> Like you said, Brother Sevrin.<br> If you do not, you will never reach Eden.<br> You and this ship will be destroyed.<br> He's got jelly in the belly.<br> Real scared.<br> Adam, Rad, you are being led by a man who is insane.<br> You are being used by him.<br> Spock, you tell them.<br> Adam, there is a file on Dr.<br> Sevrin in our computer banks.<br> In it you'll find a report attesting to the fact that he is a carrier of a bacillus strain known as Synthococcus novae.<br> Ain't that just awful? You'll find a report from the same hospital giving a full psychological profile on him and projecting these actions of his.<br> - Yea, brother.<br> - Adam, you know I reach you.<br> I believe in what you seek.<br> But there is a tragic difference between what you want and what he wants.<br> You're making me cry.<br> There it is.<br> They've established Eden, Brother Sevrin.<br> Pavel said they would.<br> Our original course must have been somewhat in error.<br> - When will we get there? - At this speed, three hours.<br> They'll try to persuade us to change course presently and then they'll attack.<br> How will you plan to stop them? By cutting off their life-support? I have another weapon.<br> Take control, Brother Rad.<br> What are you doing? Making an adjustment on their circuits.<br> Head now to Eden Yea, brother Head now to Eden No more trouble In my body or my mind Wanna live like a king On whatever I find Eat all the fruit And throw away the rind Yea, brother Yea We are within sensor range of Eden and continuing to approach.<br> Whatever they're going to do, they're going to do now.<br> We have no choice.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - When will you use that? - At the proper time.<br> - Let me know when we're in orbit.<br> - Approaching right on the dot just as they plotted it.<br> What will that do to them? What is it? I'm using sound against them.<br> Beyond the ultrasonic.<br> It will stun them and allow us time to leave.<br> We'll go in one of their shuttlecraft.<br> Sound pitched that high doesn't stun.<br> It destroys.<br> I remember when we read in the text that it I've gone beyond those texts, Irina.<br> It's correct for you to be concerned, but be assured also.<br> We are in orbit over Eden, Brother Sevrin.<br> It does destroy.<br> We cannot allow them to come after us.<br> It will not reach us in here.<br> I can control it all.<br> I have adjusted it so that it will suspend its effects after a few moments and allow us time to escape.<br> Then after we've gone, it will automatically reactivate.<br> Rejoice, brethren.<br> Soon we shall step together into Eden.<br> Spock.<br> - It's all right, Spock.<br> It's stopped.<br> - No captain, it hasn't stopped.<br> It's gone beyond Captain, they're using Steppin' in to Eden Yea, brother Steppin' in to Eden Yea, brother No more trouble In my body or my mind Gonna live like a king On whatever I find Eat all the fruit And throw away the rind Yea, brother Now we may leave.<br> Captain, go.<br> You must destroy the - What is it? - Ultrasonics.<br> The panel.<br> Kirk to Engineering.<br> Bridge? Hangar deck? Kirk to Transporter Room.<br> Kirk to Bridge.<br> Do you read me? Come in.<br> Sulu here, captain.<br> What happened to us? - I heard a whistle and then - Never mind.<br> Do we have control of the ship? No, sir.<br> Control is in auxiliary.<br> Can we break out of orbit if we have to? I think so, sir.<br> - Hangar Deck to Captain.<br> - Kirk here.<br> Sir, one of the shuttlecrafts has been taken.<br> - We were all knocked out.<br> - Stand by.<br> - You read any Romulans? - Negative, captain.<br> However, I am picking up the shuttlecraft.<br> - Where? - It has landed.<br> Except for those aboard the craft, I read no life at all, either humanoid nor animal.<br> Auxiliary control for Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Bones, are you all right? - Yes, Jim.<br> - Stand by, Transporter Room.<br> - Full medical gear.<br> - Bridge to Captain Kirk.<br> Do you wish to open communications, sir? No.<br> No, they tried to destroy us.<br> Let them think they succeeded.<br> I want the coordinates zeroed in so that when we beam down we won't be visible to them.<br> Scotty, you have the conn.<br> If any Romulans appear, try to make them understand.<br> I do not want to provoke combat.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, join us in the Transporter Room.<br> Legends were true, captain.<br> A fantastically beautiful planet.<br> Eden.<br> Is this what they believed they'd find? Then I can understand.<br> Spread out.<br> Approach with caution.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin - What is it? - The flower, sir.<br> I touched it.<br> It's like fire.<br> It's burned.<br> All this plant life is full of acid.<br> Even the grass, Jim.<br> - Will our clothing protect us? - It should for a while.<br> Captain.<br> Bones? Poison.<br> The fruit is deadly.<br> His name was Adam.<br> There's the shuttlecraft.<br> Here.<br> We'll help you.<br> Dr.<br> Sevrin.<br> Bones.<br> He should be beamed aboard, Jim.<br> He needs more than I can do for him here.<br> - Spock to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise here.<br> Stand by to beam aboard injured party.<br> Medical team to the Transporter Room.<br> No.<br> No, we're not leaving.<br> We can help you aboard the ship.<br> We're not leaving Eden, none of us.<br> Be sensible, doctor.<br> We're not leaving.<br> Come back here, you fool.<br> - Sevrin, don't! You'll kill yourself! - Don't bite into that.<br> It was so beautiful.<br> - I have starbase now, captain.<br> - Alert them that we have the four.<br> And we're ready to beam them down - and mark the incident closed.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Bridge to Transporter.<br> Scotty, are they there? Three of them, sir.<br> Expecting a fourth any minute.<br> Stand by.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, do you wish to attend? Captain, I wish first to apologise for my conduct during this time.<br> I did not maintain myself under proper discipline.<br> I endangered the ship and its personnel by my conduct.<br> I respectfully submit myself for disciplinary action.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> You did what you had to do.<br> As did we all.<br> Even your friends.<br> You may go.<br> Thank you, sir.<br> I was coming to say goodbye.<br> And I was coming to say goodbye to you.<br> Be incorrect.<br> Occasionally.<br> And you be correct.<br> Occasionally.<br> Miss Galliulin.<br> It is my sincere wish that you do not give up your search for Eden.<br> I have no doubt but that you will find it.<br> Or make it yourselves.<br> Thank you.<br> We reach, Mr.<br> Spock.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain's log, stardate 5818.<br>4.<br> A botanical plague is devastating a planet in the quadrant of the galaxy where the Enterprise is operating at present.<br> It threatens to destroy the vegetation on the entire planet, leaving it uninhabitable.<br> Per Federation orders, we are proceeding at top warp speed to the planet Ardana, where the only known source of zenite exists.<br> It is the one substance that can halt the plague.<br> Captain, the high adviser of Ardana is ready to receive you on Stratos, sir.<br> On Stratos? That's their cloud city, isn't it, Mr.<br> Spock? - It is, captain.<br> - Well, there must be some mistake.<br> Do you have the coordinates to the mine entrance available? They have already been provided to the transport officer.<br> Along with those of the council chamber of the high adviser.<br> - Kirk to Transporter Room.<br> - Ready to transport, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, are you locked in on the mine entrance or on their cloud city, Stratos? The mine entrance.<br> That's what you ordered, captain.<br> All right.<br> Uhura, tell the high adviser that we request to dispense with the welcoming ceremonies due to the emergency, that we're beaming to the mine entrance in order to ensure the fastest possible delivery of the zenite.<br> - The need is urgent.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, come with me.<br> Oh, and tell them that we appreciate the honour and that we look forward to some visit in the future.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Stratos, captain, a city actually floating in the sky.<br> Looks as tranquil as its reputation, doesn't it? It is one of the most interesting metropolises in the galaxy.<br> Have you ever visited here, captain? Once.<br> I didn't have time to look around.<br> I've never had the opportunity.<br> However, I hear its art forms are incomparable.<br> Yes, art is the population's chief occupation.<br> It is a totally intellectual society.<br> All forms of violence have been eliminated.<br> There's the mine entrance.<br> The zenite consignment should have been there.<br> I don't understand.<br> Those Troglyte miners were supposed to have made delivery when we beamed down.<br> Perhaps there is another entrance, captain.<br> It would seem the Troglytes have changed their minds about delivery.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> Who are you? What's the meaning of this attack? Interference breeds attack, captain.<br> Come on.<br> We're here by permission of your government on an emergency mission.<br> Move on, captain.<br> Troglytes, halt! Surrender or we'll fire! - Are you harmed, gentlemen? - No, just a little shaken up.<br> I am Plasus, high advisor of the planet council.<br> Captain Kirk, Enterprise.<br> My first officer, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Greetings, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> - My regrets for the unpleasantness - of your welcome to Ardana.<br> - It was rather warm.<br> Unfortunately, violence is habitual with the Troglytes.<br> But I assure you, this insult will not go unpunished.<br> I'm more concerned with the zenite consignment.<br> Why wasn't it in its specified location? Apparently the Disrupters have confiscated it, as I knew they would.<br> The Disruptors? Who are they? A small group of Troglyte malcontents.<br> All the other Troglytes are completely dominated by them.<br> The Disruptors are responsible for their refusal to continue mining for zenite.<br> They agreed to the delivery.<br> Your council assured us.<br> They agreed, obviously, as a ruse to get valuable hostages.<br> Hostages? For what purpose? To force the council to meet their demands.<br> Organise a search party immediately and find the zenite consignment.<br> Meanwhile, captain, I would suggest that you and First Officer Spock be our guests on Stratos.<br> Very well.<br> I do hope the search will be brief, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> We'll do everything possible to make it so.<br> Come, gentlemen.<br> Remarkable.<br> The finest example of sustained anti-gravity elevation I've ever seen.<br> The sentinel told me of our honoured guests, Father.<br> - I came to extend greetings.<br> - A most gracious act.<br> Gentlemen, one of our planet's most incomparable works of art.<br> My daughter Droxine.<br> Captain James Kirk.<br> - A pleasure, madam.<br> - Indeed, yes, captain.<br> And First Officer Spock.<br> I have never before met a Vulcan, sir.<br> Nor I a work of art, madam.<br> Come, gentlemen, there is much to see in our city.<br> This is our council gallery.<br> It is open to all city dwellers.<br> We have some of the finest of our various art forms assembled here for the viewing and contemplation of every - Disruptors again! - How dreadful.<br> They're despoiling the whole city.<br> Despoil? For what purpose? By keeping us in constant turmoil, they hope to force the council to accede to their demands.<br> - What are their demands? - Completely unreasonable.<br> - Nothing you need be concerned with.<br> - I must concern myself with it if it should interfere with the delivery of zenite to Merak II.<br> Mr.<br> Advisor, the plant life is the source of oxygen on that planet.<br> Obviously, if all plant life is destroyed, the humanoid life will follow.<br> I assure you, gentlemen, you will get what you came for.<br> I hope so.<br> Ardana is a member of the Federation.<br> And it is your council's responsibility that nothing interferes with its obligation to another member of the Federation.<br> Of course, and we accept the responsibility.<br> But why do they destroy art forms? That is a loss to everyone.<br> Art means nothing to the Disruptors.<br> This is the only form they understand.<br> The disturbances accompanying your arrival have been most wearying.<br> No doubt you would like to rest.<br> That would be most welcome, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> Chambers have been prepared for you.<br> A sentinel will guide you to them.<br> I'm sorry they were so poorly treated on their first visit to our planet.<br> It's fortunate they were not seriously hurt.<br> Oh, yeas, that would have been dreadful.<br> Further violence could create grave difficulties between Ardana and the Federation.<br> The Disruptors must be mad to attack two such charming strangers.<br> They grow more daring and determined every day.<br> Now they seek to find allies in the galaxy.<br> Do you think that Captain Kirk and his very attractive officer will feel that we're responsible for their injuries? All this time I thought you were worried about our diplomatic relations.<br> Apologies, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> This Troglyte was apprehended leaving the city.<br> He is without a transport card, so we thought you would want - to question him.<br> - Remove his shields.<br> What is your business in Stratos, Troglyte? - Speak! I command you.<br> - My business is to repair.<br> - Repair what? - There are damaged entrance panels.<br> Indeed.<br> Then you must have a repair permit.<br> Where is it? - It was forgotten.<br> - Did you also forget your transport card? It was lost when your sentinels attacked me.<br> And where was your cavern implement lost? - Could this perhaps be it? - I came to make repairs.<br> You shall make them, by giving us the names of the Disruptors.<br> I know nothing.<br> I would advise you to increase your knowledge.<br> That is not possible for a Troglyte.<br> The Stratos city dwellers have said it.<br> Secure him to the rostrum.<br> How unfortunate.<br> How unfortunate.<br> This troubled planet is a place of the most violent contrasts.<br> Those who receive the rewards are totally separated from those who shoulder the burdens.<br> It is not a wise leadership.<br> Here on Stratos, everything is incomparably beautiful and pleasant.<br> The high advisor's charming daughter, Droxine, particularly so.<br> The name Droxine seems appropriate for her.<br> I wonder, can she retain such purity and sweetness of mind and be aware of the life of the people on the surface of the planet? There, the harsh life in the mines is instilling the people with a bitter hatred.<br> The young girl who led the attack against us when we beamed down was filled with the violence of desperation.<br> If the lovely Droxine knew of the young miners' misery, I wonder how the knowledge would affect her.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I thought you had accompanied Captain Kirk to the rest chamber.<br> - Your movements awakened me.<br> - My apologies.<br> I did not realise they would disturb you.<br> Only Vulcan ears would find the noise discernible.<br> It seems that Vulcans are fascinatingly different, in many ways.<br> The same may be said of Stratos' inhabitants.<br> Vulcan eyes are very discerning too.<br> I hear that, intellectually, Vulcans are as highly evolved as Stratos city dwellers.<br> We do pride ourselves on our logic.<br> You again! You sleep lightly, captain.<br> Yes, duty is a good teacher.<br> I see you've changed your dressmaker.<br> Release me.<br> So you can attack me again? That would be foolish.<br> Call the guards if you're afraid, captain.<br> I'm not afraid.<br> In fact, I find this rather enjoyable.<br> I do not! All right, I'll make a deal with you.<br> You answer some questions and I'll let you up.<br> What questions? Your word first.<br> I will answer.<br> You only take a mate once every seven years? The seven-year cycle is biologically inherent in all Vulcans.<br> At that time, the mating drive outweighs all other motivations.<br> And is there nothing that can disturb that cycle, Mr.<br> Spock? Extreme feminine beauty is always disturbing, madam.<br> Spock? I did not come here to kill you, captain.<br> Then why this? To take you hostage.<br> Am I intruding, captain? - Vanna.<br> - Droxine.<br> Why have you come here? To welcome our honoured guests as I was taught to do when I served in your father's household.<br> - Has she injured you, captain? - No, not at all.<br> In fact, her visit was quite enlightening.<br> - Oh? - Yes, it seems the Troglytes are under the impression that the Enterprise is here to intimidate them.<br> Send a sentinel to the rest chamber immediately.<br> It is not impression, captain.<br> It is the truth.<br> We're here to get zenite consignment and that's it.<br> Starships do not transport cargo.<br> In times of emergency, they do anything.<br> And believe me, this botanical plague is an emergency.<br> Lies will not keep the Troglytes in the caverns and neither will your starship.<br> You talk like a Disruptor, Vanna.<br> I speak for my people.<br> They have as much right to the clouds as the Stratos dwellers.<br> The Stratos is for advisors and studiers.<br> What would Troglytes do here? Live.<br> In the sunlight and warmth, as everyone should.<br> The caverns are warm and your eyes are not accustomed to light.<br> Just as your minds are not accustomed to logic.<br> Unaccustomed to light and warmth? That's necessary to all humanoids.<br> Surely you don't deny it to the Troglytes.<br> The Troglytes are workers, captain.<br> Surely you must be aware of that.<br> They mine zenite for shipment, till the soil.<br> Those things cannot be done here.<br> In other words, they perform all the physical toil necessary to maintain Stratos.<br> That is their function in our society.<br> But they are not allowed to share its advantages.<br> How can they share what they do not understand? They can be taught to understand, especially in a society that prides itself in enlightenment.<br> The complete separation of toil and leisure has given Ardana this perfectly balanced social system, captain.<br> Why should we change it? The surface of the planet is almost unendurable.<br> To restrict a segment of the population to such hardship is unthinkable in an evolved culture.<br> The surface is marred by violence.<br> Like the Troglytes.<br> Here on Stratos, we have completely eliminated violence.<br> You still refuse to disclose the names of other Disruptors? There are no Disruptors.<br> Very well.<br> If you prefer the rays.<br> Troglyte is an abbreviation of an ancient Earth term, captain.<br> Its technical translation is cave dweller.<br> Yes.<br> I should have realised Mr.<br> Advisor! You said you were going to question Vanna, not torture her.<br> She is stubborn and as you yourself pointed out, captain, the search for your zenite consignment must be short.<br> Surely there are better methods than this.<br> Physical discomfort is extremely persuasive, captain.<br> Yes, but I won't stand by while someone is tortured.<br> Is it preferable to spare Vanna and allow an entire planet to be destroyed? Violence in reality is quite different from theory, is it not, madam? But what else can they understand, Mr.<br> Spock? All the little things you and I understand and expect from life, such as equality, kindness, justice.<br> Troglytes are not like Stratos dwellers, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> They're a conglomerate of inferior species.<br> The abstract concepts of an intellectual society are beyond their comprehension.<br> The abstract concepts of loyalty and leadership seem perfectly clear to Vanna.<br> A few Troglytes are brought here as retainers.<br> Vanna was one of them, as are the sentinels.<br> They've received more training than the others.<br> But obviously no more consideration.<br> I fail to see the purpose of this continued criticism.<br> The only way you'll use that device again is on one of us.<br> An imposing display of primitive gallantry, gentlemen.<br> You realise, of course, that the sentinels could remove you? Of course, but Starfleet Command won't take kindly to having either rays or physical force used against one of its command personnel, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> Why are you so concerned with this Disruptor's well-being? Beyond plain humanitarianism, my orders are to get that zenite.<br> Then stop interfering and I'll get it for you.<br> You won't get it through torture! We will get it for you, and in our own way.<br> Remove the prisoner to confinement quarters.<br> You will return to your ship at once or I shall contact your Starfleet Command myself and report your interference with this planet's government.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Enterprise, captain.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, we're ready to beam up.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> If Captain Kirk appears again, kill him.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5819.<br>0.<br> More than eight hours have passed since the consignment of zenite disappeared and we have still found no trace of it.<br> We've received word from Merak II that the botanical plague is spreading rapidly.<br> Delivery of the zenite is imperative within 12 hours or all life on the planet will be annihilated.<br> Lt.<br> Uhura, advise Starfleet Command that the zenite has not been delivered.<br> In my opinion, Plasus' method of accomplishing delivery will not succeed.<br> If the zenite is not delivered shortly, I shall have to violate Plasus' order of non-interference and win the confidence of the Troglyte leader with the use of reason.<br> It may not be easy, Jim.<br> Medical analysis indicates the Troglytes are mentally inferior.<br> That's impossible, Bones.<br> The Troglytes have accepted personal sacrifice, a common cause.<br> Mentally inferior beings aren't capable of that.<br> Look, I've checked my findings thoroughly.<br> Their intellect ratings are almost 20% below average.<br> But they're all the same species.<br> Those who live on Stratos and those who live below all originated on the planet.<br> Their physical and mental evolution must be similar.<br> That is basic biological law.<br> That's true, Spock, but obviously the ancestors of those who live on Stratos removed themselves from the environment of the mines.<br> Therefore, they avoided the effects of certain natural growths.<br> Natural growths? What kind? Well, I had this zenite sample sent up from the surface.<br> Now, unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here.<br> Incredible.<br> Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria.<br> - No side effects have been reported.<br> - There are none after it's refined.<br> But in its raw state, it emits an odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotion.<br> Therefore, it releases a violent reaction.<br> And the mines are full of that gas.<br> That's right.<br> And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.<br> Bones, the Disruptors, Vanna.<br> It seems impossible.<br> They've outwitted a highly-organised scientific culture for months.<br> As part of the staff of Stratos, Vanna was removed from exposure for a long period.<br> It is likely that without such exposure, the effect slowly wears off.<br> That's right, Spock.<br> The other Disruptors were probably removed from the exposure too.<br> - Does the brain return to normal? - According to findings, it should.<br> Can you neutralise the gas? No, but a filter mask should remove the exposure.<br> Find one.<br> Meet us in the Transporter Room.<br> This mask automatically eliminates all substance injurious to humanoid life chemical as well as bacterial.<br> We have used these filter masks frequently on Do you really expect me to believe that that mask can achieve intellectual equality for the Troglytes? There's every indication that the effect of the gas is temporary, even after repeated exposure.<br> How can a mere filter accomplish what centuries of evolution have failed to do? Dr.<br> McCoy has analysed the zenite thoroughly.<br> We've checked his findings through the computer, and they're absolutely valid.<br> And do your computers explain how my ancestors, who also dwelt in caverns, evolved sufficiently to erect Stratos, while the Troglytes did not? Unequal evolution did not begin until after your ancestors removed themselves from constant exposure to the gas, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> Preposterous.<br> There's no time to argue about the findings.<br> I propose to tell Vanna all about them.<br> I doubt whether even Vanna will believe such nonsense.<br> This nonsense might mean a great deal to the Troglytes.<br> I would like to offer them a supply of these filter masks in exchange for the zenite consignment.<br> I'm sorry, captain.<br> Such an offer could only cause more unrest among them.<br> I cannot allow it until our scientists have checked the findings.<br> - That could take days.<br> - Are you afraid the masks will work? Is that why you don't want the Troglytes to try them? You are here to complete an emergency mission, not conduct tests.<br> I'm here to get that zenite.<br> If these will help me get them, then I'll use them.<br> And I forbid it.<br> Your Federation orders do not entitle you to defy local governments.<br> This communication has ended.<br> My diplomacy is somewhat inadequate.<br> Well, it's pretty hard to overcome prejudice.<br> - Doesn't give us much choice, does it? - Nor much time.<br> We have ten hours and 40 minutes to deliver that consignment to Merak II.<br> Beam me down to Vanna's confinement quarters.<br> You mean you're going back to Stratos against government orders? If Vanna doesn't have something definite to gain for her people, she'll die rather than turn over that zenite consignment.<br> This might convince her.<br> Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the high advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed if he chooses.<br> If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer's negative, Spock.<br> That goes for you, too, Bones.<br> Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain.<br> Officially, but this mission is strictly unofficial.<br> Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself.<br> That's an order, Spock.<br> You have the Conn.<br> Stand by till I contact you.<br> Vanna.<br> I've brought you a gift.<br> There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time.<br> This mask will prevent any further damage.<br> - Gas from zenite? - Yes.<br> It's hard to believe that something which is neither seen nor felt can do so much harm.<br> It's true, but an idea can't be seen or felt.<br> And that's kept the Troglytes in the mines all these centuries.<br> A mistaken idea.<br> Would all the Troglytes wear these masks? Yes.<br> I'll see to it that the Federation engineers construct them.<br> Suppose Plasus does not agree? Plasus is not the whole government.<br> That is true, but the city council will not listen to Troglytes.<br> As soon as the zenite is delivered to Merak II, I'll come back.<br> I'll request permission to mediate for the Troglytes.<br> Vanna.<br> You must trust me.<br> I give you my word.<br> Centuries ago, Stratos was built by leaders that gave their word that all inhabitants would live there.<br> The Troglytes are still waiting.<br> The zenite can be delivered in a few hours.<br> - You won't have long to wait now.<br> - Hours can be centuries.<br> Just as words can be lies.<br> Vanna.<br> You must trust me.<br> If you don't, millions of people will die.<br> A whole planet.<br> This zenite is all that can save them.<br> This filter mask is all that can save the Troglytes.<br> Trust me.<br> Please.<br> Very well, captain.<br> I will trust you.<br> The consignment lies deep in the mines in a place known only to Troglytes.<br> I cannot direct you.<br> I must take you there.<br> You asked for my trust, captain.<br> Are you unwilling to give yours? It's the sentinel with my refreshment.<br> Wait.<br> We'll need a transport pass to leave the city.<br> - Midro.<br> - Vanna.<br> - Anka.<br> - You have returned.<br> And I've brought with me a hostage.<br> Seize him! We had a bargain.<br> Why did you break it? Did you really think I would trust you, captain? - I'm not such a fool.<br> - I trusted you.<br> You thought you would trick me with your talk of your filter and your unseen gas.<br> I don't believe you any more than Plasus does.<br> Then you are a fool.<br> These masks will free you, just as I said.<br> Our weapons are our freedom and you've just furnished me with two very valuable ones.<br> Yourself and this.<br> Holding me won't help you.<br> My men will still come for that zenite.<br> Without your communicator, you will be hard to locate.<br> - They'll still come.<br> - Perhaps.<br> In the meantime, a taste of our existence, captain.<br> Dig as the Troglytes do.<br> As the Troglytes do.<br> Without that mask, I haven't With your bare hands, captain.<br> Captain's log supplemental, stardate 5819.<br>3.<br> First Officer Spock reporting.<br> Captain Kirk beamed down to Stratos to attempts to win the confidence of the rebel Troglytes.<br> Unless he has made his escape from Stratos to the mines, his life is in danger from the high advisor.<br> The captain has not informed us of his progress.<br> For our part, we must maintain silence.<br> We can be of no help to him without jeopardising his life.<br> You dig well, captain.<br> The unseen gas doesn't seem to be harming you.<br> It takes a while for its effects to be noticed.<br> Nevertheless, you won't be needing this.<br> Anka, deposit this on the transport platform, so Plasus will know we have something more valuable to bargain with than our mortaes and thongs.<br> You are clever, Vanna, very clever.<br> Searchers will be coming soon, Midro.<br> Go to other mines and tell the Troglytes to post watchers.<br> - What of him? - I will see that he doesn't escape.<br> If we kill him, there will be no need to see.<br> A dead hostage is of no value, Midro.<br> - Only the Troglytes will know.<br> - I brought him here.<br> And I will say what is to be done.<br> You are not the only Disruptor.<br> I, too, can say.<br> Can you do nothing but argue? The searchers will be here soon.<br> When Anka returns, we will all say.<br> Is that what you Disruptors are bargaining for? The right to kill everyone? - Midro is a child.<br> - The masks can change that.<br> Return to the digging, captain.<br> How long do you plan on keeping me here? Providing Midro doesn't kill me, of course.<br> Until we have help in the mines and our homes are in the clouds.<br> That's quite a while.<br> Longer than I expected.<br> - We're sealed in.<br> - Completely.<br> But soon the atmosphere will go.<br> We'll die.<br> Die from something that can't be seen? You astound me, Vanna.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> - Spock here.<br> We've been trying to make contact, captain.<br> Is anything wrong? Nothing, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Are you locked in on me? Locked in, and ready to beam up consignment.<br> Circumstances dictate a slight variation, Spock.<br> Standing by for instructions.<br> Hold on these coordinates.<br> Locate the high advisor and beam him to these coordinates immediately.<br> Without advance communication.<br> Repeat.<br> Without advance communication.<br> Have you got that, Spock? Instructions clear.<br> I shall carry them out immediately.<br> Spock out.<br> You would seal Plasus here also? For what purpose? I'm preparing a demonstration.<br> On the effects of unbelieved gas.<br> Beam the high advisor down without warning, did he say? That's not an exact quote, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> However, it does express the thought.<br> - I'd like to see the advisor's face.<br> - You will have that opportunity.<br> The captain did say immediately, did he not? Now, that is an exact quote, Mr.<br> Scott, and I suggest you handle the Transporter yourself.<br> This could be very delicate as a problem in transporting for us - and in diplomacy for the captain.<br> - Aye.<br> - Something's upsetting you, Droxine.<br> - No, Father.<br> - What is it? Tell me.<br> - No, really, I'm not upset.<br> I was just standing here looking into space and wondering whether or not he would return.<br> He will never return.<br> I have seen to that.<br> But the zenite is so important to him.<br> He must have it.<br> It will be delivered.<br> If we have to kill every Troglyte below, it will be delivered.<br> By that time, it may be too late.<br> Perhaps he does have a method He knows nothing, except how to destroy our power and our society.<br> I forbid you ever to speak of Captain Kirk, even to think of him.<br> - Transporter Room to Mr.<br> Spock.<br> - Spock here.<br> I've locked into the coordinates of the cloud city council gallery.<br> Ready to transport the high advisor.<br> - You'll have to delay.<br> - What's wrong? I'm picking up two life-forms in the gallery.<br> They are inseparably close to one another.<br> We cannot transport one without the other.<br> Did you say the word \"immediately\" was an exact quote of the captain's order? - Precisely, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Well, are we going to do anything about it? Until the high advisor is alone or can be isolated, the captain will have to wait.<br> Unless you have an alternative.<br> I'll give it further thought.<br> I wasn't thinking of Captain Kirk.<br> It's the one with those exquisitely-shaped ears.<br> His name is Spock.<br> He's the one I was thinking about.<br> Did you know that he has the most incredibly sensitive hearing? Why, I almost believe that if I stood here and called out to him, he would hear my invitation to come and visit with us for a little while longer.<br> Oh, he's no better than his friend.<br> Shall we try? What is it? The Disruptor Vanna has disappeared.<br> Her guard was found half-unconscious.<br> - He'd been attacked by Captain Kirk.<br> - Where is Captain Kirk? He did not know, sir.<br> He did not regain his senses until I came to his aid.<br> This is the kind of reason they use to persuade us.<br> - They are desperate.<br> - I will hear no more defence of them.<br> I'm sure Mr.<br> Spock would not behave so.<br> Leave here at once.<br> Go to your music.<br> Father, are we so sure of our methods that we never question what we do? - Spock to Transporter Room.<br> - Scott here.<br> - Lock on council gallery coordinates.<br> - Locked in, sir.<br> - Energize.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Energizing.<br> - How are you doing, Mr.<br> Scott? - Fine, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> The high advisor is materialising on the platform.<br> - Beam him down to Captain Kirk.<br> - Energizing, sir.<br> - He's on his way to the captain.<br> - Good work, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> The advisor looked mighty angry.<br> I hope he doesn't give the captain too much trouble.<br> The captain will employ his usual diplomatic balm.<br> Abduction of a planet official is a serious crime.<br> You will pay for this, I promise you.<br> Not until you're convinced of the effects of the zenite gas.<br> Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> What effects? I've been here nearly an hour of your Earth time! You and Vanna even longer! I see no changes in any of us.<br> Perhaps you need closer exposure.<br> Fill that container.<br> Are you suggesting that I dig zenite? - I insist.<br> - You will indeed pay for this.<br> You, too, Vanna.<br> You, too! Dig! Kirk here.<br> What is it? Contact check, captain.<br> It has been an hour since your last communication.<br> Your orders are to stand by.<br> Now, carry them out.<br> Kirk out.<br> Standing by, captain.<br> However, let me remind you we have only five hours left.<br> - Very unlike the captain.<br> - Can the zenite be affecting him? I grow faint.<br> The oxygen is going.<br> She's right.<br> Kirk, transport us out of here.<br> We'll leave when the gas has effect.<br> It will never take effect.<br> Transport us out of here! - Dig! - Imbecile.<br> We'll die! I said dig! I am high advisor of all the planet.<br> I will take no more orders! - One more step and I'll kill you.<br> - The gas.<br> Captain, you were right.<br> It's taking effect.<br> Captain, you were right.<br> Are you as brave with mortae as you are with a phaser? Both will kill.<br> Enterprise! Enterprise, help! - Enterprise! - Enterprise.<br> Spock here.<br> They'll kill each other.<br> Help us.<br> Help us! Enterprise! Enterprise! The zenite gas has affected you.<br> Captain! The zenite gas! Zenite gas.<br> - Look out, Jim! - Captain! Well.<br> It seems my little demonstration was quite a success.<br> I don't like filters, or even masks.<br> I like the word \"protector\" much better, don't you? It is less technical, therefore less accurate.<br> But perhaps more generally descriptive of the function.<br> It appears you have what you came for after all.<br> The captain will have his zenite just as I agreed.<br> Agreed? There's no such word in the Troglyte vocabulary.<br> The captain will have his zenite.<br> No thanks to any agreement by you.<br> It had to be obtained by force.<br> Because it is the only way we can obtain what is due us.<br> How about your education? Was that by force? It served your purpose at the time.<br> You could have had those filters, for all the good it will do you.<br> They will be very effective, sir.<br> They've been severely tested.<br> And the Troglytes will no longer suffer from retardation and emotional difficulties.<br> They will all be like her.<br> Ungrateful, vindictive.<br> Yes.<br> Our demands have just begun.<br> Here is the zenite, captain.<br> - Just as I promised.<br> - Thank you, Vanna.<br> Stratos is so pleasant and so beautiful.<br> I think I'm afraid to leave it.<br> There is great beauty in the knowledge that lies below.<br> And only one way to really experience it.<br> I shall go to the mines.<br> I no longer wish to be limited to the clouds.<br> Is your planet like this one? No.<br> No, Vulcan is quite different.<br> Some day I should like to visit it.<br> Perhaps some form of mediation can be helpful in your difficulties.<br> The Federation Bureau of Industrialization may be of aid to you.<br> I will tolerate absolutely no interference! You will not set foot here as long as I rule! Believe me, sir, I have neither the time nor the desire to return here.<br> Only answering your charges against me will force me back.<br> And I shall press them.<br> You are guilty of abduction, captain! You're guilty of attacking a starship commander - and plotting against his life.<br> - Captain, perhaps both incidents are best forgotten.<br> Yes, Vanna.<br> They never happened, Mr.<br> Advisor.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, let's get that zenite delivered.<br> I believe we only have three hours left.<br> Two hours, 59 minutes to be exact, captain.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, beam us up.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

I understand President Lincoln's coming aboard, sir.<br> Oh, you're daft, man.<br> All I know, sir, is what the captain tells me, and he says he'll have the hide of the first man that so much as smiles.<br> I'd have expected sanity from the ship's surgeon, at least.<br> President Lincoln, indeed.<br> No doubt to be followed by Louis of France and Robert the Bruce.<br> If so, we'll execute appropriate honours to each, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Gentlemen.<br> I don't for a moment believe that President Lincoln is actually coming aboard.<br> But we're dealing with an unknown, apparently highly advanced life form.<br> Until we know, when in Rome, we'll do as the Romans do.<br> Bridge to Transporter Room.<br> One minute to overhead position.<br> Locked onto something.<br> Does that appear human to you, Mr.<br> Spock?

Commander Spock, second in command, Engineering Officer Scott and Security Officer Dickerson.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, Mr.<br> Scott, Mr.<br> Dickerson.<br> Gentlemen, I hope to talk to each of you.<br> But meanwhile, your captain is consumed with questions, and I shall do my utmost to answer them.<br> And I trust your duties will permit time to answer some of mine.<br> At your service, captain.<br> Lieutenant Dickerson, you and your men may return to quarters.<br> Mr.<br> President.<br> - Spock.<br> - A most interesting vessel.<br> Just what was it you locked onto before you beamed him aboard? You heard Mr.<br> Spock yourself.<br> Mineral, he called it.<br> Like living rock.<br> - And that became Lincoln.<br> - I couldn't tell.<br> May have been another figure down there standing by.<br> What do you make of it? I'm not quite sure.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5906.<br>4.<br> Who or what has been beamed aboard our vessel? An alien who has changed himself into this form? An illusion? I cannot conceive it possible that Abraham Lincoln could have actually been reincarnated.<br> And yet his kindness, his gentle wisdom, his humour, everything about him is so right.<br> Yes, if I recall, your Union army observation balloons were tendered 600 or so feet high.<br> We're 643 miles above the surface of this planet.<br> You can measure great distances that closely? We do, sir.<br> Six hundred forty-three miles, at this moment, using your old-style measurements.<br> Bless me.<br> Excuse me, Captain Kirk.<br> - Yes, lieutenant.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott What a charming Negress.<br> Forgive me, my dear.<br> I know that in my time, some used that term as a description of property.<br> But why should I object to that term, sir? You see, in our century, we've learned not to fear words.<br> May I present our communications officer, Lieutenant Uhura? The foolishness of my century had me apologising where no offence was given.<br> We've each learned to be delighted with what we are.<br> The Vulcans learned that centuries before we did.<br> It is basic to the Vulcan philosophy, sir.<br> The combination of a number of things to make existence worthwhile.<br> Yes, philosophy of Nome, meaning \"all.<br>\" How did I know that? Just as I seem to know that on the planet's surface, you will meet one of the greatest living Vulcans in all the long history of your planet.<br> My mind cannot recall his name, but I know he will be there.<br> What is it that powers your vessel, captain? - May I see your engine room? - Certainly.<br> Our engineering officer Has been waiting in the briefing room for you, sir, for over two hours.<br> Oh, dear.<br> If you'll forgive me, our communications officer I would be delighted to have her as guide.<br> Forgive me again.<br> We'll rejoin you shortly.<br> Where the devil are they? They're probably looking up a plate of haggis in the galley.<br> They've been everywhere else.<br> Sorry to have been delayed, gentlemen.<br> Jim, I would be the last to advise you on your command image I doubt that, Bones, but continue.<br> Do I have to lay it out for you? Practically the entire crew's seen you treat this impostor like the real thing, when he can't possibly be the real article.<br> Lincoln died three centuries ago on a planet hundreds of light-years away.<br> More that direction, engineer.<br> You're the science officer.<br> Why aren't you, well, doing whatever a science officer does at a time like this? I am, doctor.<br> I am observing the alien.<br> Well, at last.<br> At least somebody agrees with us.<br> - He's an alien.<br> - Yes, of course he's an alien.<br> And he's potentially dangerous.<br> Mad.<br> Loony as an Arcturian dogbird.<br> Gentlemen.<br> As you know, Mr.<br> Spock and I have been invited to beam down to the planet's surface with him.<br> - Any comments on that? - Yes, a big one.<br> Suddenly, miraculously, we see a small spot of Earth-type environment down there.<br> Now, is it really there, or do we just think we see it down there? You might beam down into a sea of molten lava.<br> But why would he wanna kill only two of us? It would be illogical.<br> With such abilities, they could as easily trick us into destroying the entire vessel.<br> Are you implying, Mr.<br> Spock, that it's probably safe to beam down there? No, I'm not, doctor.<br> There's no doubt they want us down there for some hidden purpose.<br> Otherwise, they would have revealed some logical reason for all of this.<br> Why Lincoln, Spock? Any speculation on that? Speculation is unnecessary, captain.<br> The answer is clear.<br> President Lincoln has always been a very personal hero to you.<br> What better way to titillate your curiosity than to make him come alive for you? But not only to me, Spock.<br> Agreed.<br> I too experienced his charm.<br> It is a magnificent work of duplication.<br> But he holds a special involvement to you, Jim.<br> And I think it's interesting, inasmuch as you're the one who's going to make the decision whether to beam down or not.<br> Don't do it, captain.<br> The very reason for the existence of our starships is contact with other life.<br> Although the method is beyond our comprehension, we have been offered contact.<br> Therefore, I shall beam down.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, as for you Captain, since I was included in the invitation to make contact, I must beam down with you.<br> - You're both out of your head.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> And you're on the edge of insubordination.<br> Would I be on the edge of insubordination to remind the captain that this smells of something happening to him that I might not be able to patch back together again? Aye.<br> Gentlemen, your concern is noted and appreciated.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, standard dress, tricorders and phasers.<br> We will guide President Lincoln to the Transporter Room.<br> We'll beam down immediately.<br> Standing by, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Transporter Room to Bridge, standing by.<br> We are now locked in synchronous orbit, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Sensors continue to show the area as completely Earth-like in all respects.<br> If they are wrong and they do beam into a pool of lava Then they're dead men.<br> I couldn't pull them back in time.<br> All right, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Energize.<br> Scotty.<br> Captain.<br> Our phasers and tricorders did not beam down with us.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise? Enterprise, come in.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Undamaged, yet something is preventing them from functioning.<br> Come in, landing party.<br> Report.<br> Enterprise to Captain Kirk.<br> Can you read us? If they're all right, they should have reported in.<br> - Your explanation, sir? - Well, I have none.<br> To me, this seems quite as it should be.<br> Why were our weapons taken? Why can't we communicate with our ship? Please, believe me.<br> I know nothing other than what I already told you.<br> The game is over.<br> We've treated you with courtesy.<br> We've gone along with what and who you think you are.<br> Despite the seeming contradictions, all is as it appears to be.<br> I am Abraham Lincoln.<br> Just as I am whom I appear to be.<br> - Surak.<br> - Who? The greatest of all who ever lived on our planet, captain.<br> The father of all we became.<br> All-ship system going dead.<br> Switch to reserve power.<br> All decks, report status.<br> All decks, report status.<br> All decks, report status.<br> Bridge to Engineering.<br> Come in.<br> What's happening to our power? Bridge to Engineering.<br> Report.<br> Everything's out.<br> We've switched to reserve power.<br> We've lost all power in the warp engines.<br> How is it, Mr.<br> Sulu? No answer yet on what caused it.<br> They're standing by.<br> Shut down all but the most necessary systems.<br> - No damage report, Mr.<br> Scott.<br> - No indication of engine damage, sir.<br> - Engage restart cycle.<br> - I can't.<br> I don't understand.<br> - Start emergency procedures.<br> - Aye, aye, sir.<br> Live long and prosper, Spock.<br> May you also, Captain Kirk.<br> It is not logical that you are Surak.<br> There is no fact, extrapolation of fact, or theory, which would make possible Whatever I am, would it harm you to give response? Live long and prosper, image of Surak, father of all we now hold true.<br> The image of Surak read in your face what is in your mind, Spock.<br> As I turned and my eyes beheld you, I displayed emotion.<br> I beg forgiveness.<br> The cause was more than sufficient.<br> Let us speak no further of it.<br> In my time, we knew not of earthmen.<br> I am pleased to see that we have differences.<br> May we together become greater than the sum of both of us.<br> Spock, we'll not go along with these charades any longer.<br> You will have an answer soon, captain.<br> Our world is called Excalbia.<br> Countless who live on that planet are watching.<br> Before this drama unfolds, we give welcome to the ones named Kirk and Spock.<br> We know nothing of your world, or your customs.<br> What do you mean, \"drama about to unfold\"? You're intelligent life form, so I am surprised you do not perceive the honour we do you.<br> Have we not created in this place on our planet a stage identical to your own world? We perceive that we were invited to come down here, and we came in friendship.<br> And you have deprived us of our instruments to examine your world, to defend ourselves, to communicate with our vessel.<br> Your objection is well taken.<br> We shall communicate with your vessel so that your fellow life forms may also enjoy and profit from the play.<br> Behold.<br> Captain, Mr.<br> Spock, some of these you may know through history.<br> Genghis Khan, for one.<br> And Colonel Green, who led a genocidal war early in the 21 st century on Earth.<br> Zora, who experimented with the body chemistry of subject tribes on Tiburon.<br> Kahless the Unforgettable, the Klingon who set the pattern for his planet's tyrannies.<br> We welcome the vessel Enterprise to our solar system and to our spectacle.<br> Well, at least the captain and Spock are safe.<br> It's a confrontation of some sort.<br> Those are all figures out of history.<br> Notoriously evil.<br> We ask you to observe with us the confrontation of the two opposing philosophies you term \"good\" and \"evil.<br>\" Since this is our first experiment with earthlings, our theme is a simple one: Survival.<br> Life and death.<br> Your philosophies are alien to us, and we wish to understand them and discover which is the stronger.<br> We learn by observing such spectacles.<br> What do you mean, \"survival\"? The word is explicit.<br> If you and Spock survive, you return to your vessel.<br> If you do not, your existence is ended.<br> Can we beam the captain and Spock back up? We don't have the power.<br> They'll come aboard a mass of dying flesh.<br> Well, can we send the phasers down? There's nothing we can do, doctor.<br> Nothing but watch them.<br> He's skimmed the worst ones in history to face them.<br> But they're not real.<br> Any more than that Lincoln or Surak.<br> What do the sensors read? As life forms.<br> They are living beings.<br> Could they be aliens, projecting an illusion? The readings are those of humanoids.<br> Why do you hesitate? Do you wish further clarification? Your choice of action is unlimited, as is your choice of weapons.<br> Should you wish to use any, you may fabricate anything you desire out of what you can find around you.<br> Captain.<br> Mr.<br> Spock and I refuse to participate.<br> You will decide otherwise.<br> Analysis, Spock.<br> Why do they want us to fight? It may be exactly as explained, captain.<br> Our concept of good and evil is strange to them.<br> Perhaps they wish to determine which is strongest.<br> And they'll get their answer if it kills us.<br> I'm afraid none of us may leave, gentlemen, until we do what it demands of us.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> May I speak with you? I quite agree with your attitude toward this charade.<br> It's ridiculous to think that we should take part in it.<br> What do you want? Well, the same as you do.<br> To get out of here.<br> I have no quarrel with you, any more than you have with me.<br> You're somewhat different than the way history paints you, Colonel Green.<br> History tends to exaggerate.<br> I suggest we call a halt to this at once and see if we can't find some way out of our difficulties.<br> My associates are in full agreement with me.<br> Captain.<br> You were tricked into coming here, weren't you? So were we all.<br> Where do you come from? I can't remember.<br> Isn't that strange? My memory used to be quite remarkable.<br> Well, wherever it was, I want to get back.<br> So it seems to me, captain, that we have a common cause.<br> And our enemy is that creature.<br> What do you propose? That we combine forces and reason some way to overcome it.<br> You were notorious, Colonel Green, for striking at your enemies in the midst of negotiating with them.<br> But that was centuries ago, captain, and not altogether true.<br> No, there's much I would change now, if I could.<br> Don't let prejudice and rumour sway you.<br> Captain.<br> How can we warn him? Anyone hurt? Well, I feel my clothing is somewhat damaged.<br> But how delightful to discover at my age that I can still wrestle.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock? - I'm all right, captain.<br> However, I suggest that we prepare ourselves for another attack.<br> No.<br> I think Colonel Green is right.<br> That rocklike thing is our enemy.<br> Not those illusions.<br> For an illusion, my opponent carried a considerable punch.<br> Oh, I forgot.<br> You consider me an illusion too.<br> The captain speaks wisely.<br> Those four are not our enemy.<br> We should arrive together at a peaceful settlement.<br> I am disappointed.<br> You display no interest in the honour we do you.<br> We offer you an opportunity to become our teachers by demonstrating whether good or evil is more powerful.<br> Do you find my body heat distressing, captain? You forget the nature of this planet.<br> I must conclude that your species requires a cause to fight for.<br> You may now communicate with your ship.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Enterprise, come in.<br> Scott to Engineering.<br> Report, lieutenant.<br> Emergency increasing, sir.<br> Deterioration has just started, sir.<br> Give me that again, man.<br> I cannot hear you.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, I have the captain.<br> Scotty, do you read me? Mr.<br> Scott, I have the captain.<br> Engineering, check for radiation.<br> Get a repair crew on it at once.<br> I have already, sir.<br> We can't seem to stop it.<br> - Is there a danger of detonation? - Estimating four hours, sir.<br> Red alert, captain.<br> Mr.<br> Scott is standing by.<br> - What caused the red alert? - I don't know yet, sir.<br> - Captain.<br> - Scotty, beam us up fast.<br> I cannot.<br> We have a complete power failure.<br> We're on emergency battery power only.<br> - What happened? - I can't explain it, sir.<br> But the matter and antimatter are in red-zone proximity.<br> What caused that? There's no knowing, and there's no stopping it either.<br> The shielding is breaking down, and I estimate four hours before it goes completely.<br> Four hours before the ship blows up.<br> The estimate is quite correct.<br> Your ship will blow itself to bits within four hours, captain, unless you defeat the others before then.<br> Is that cause enough to fight for? What if they defeat us? To save your ship and your crew, you have to win.<br> Scotty, inform Starfleet Command.<br> Disengage nacelles.<br> Jettison, if possible.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, assist him.<br> Advise and analyse.<br> Scotty? Scotty? Your communicators no longer function, captain.<br> You may proceed with the spectacle.<br> James, the war is forced upon us.<br> History repeats itself.<br> Supplemental log, stardate 5906.<br>5.<br> Engineer Scott reporting.<br> The Enterprise is doomed to explode in two hours if Captain Kirk is defeated by the enemy on the surface of the planet.<br> The enormous power of the Enterprise has been neutralised, and we sit here watching, unable to assist.<br> - Did you set the traps? - Yes.<br> What'd you find? What are they doing? They've done nothing.<br> They've not armed themselves, nor prepared for any kind of defence.<br> - I say attack now and finish them.<br> - With what, these? - Better than what they have.<br> - No, it's not advantage enough.<br> I wanna make sure the odds are in our favour.<br> Overwhelm and devastate.<br> That's the way to get power and to hold it.<br> And I mean to do that.<br> There's nothing immoral about fighting an illusion, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> We play their game, fight, or lose the ship and all the crewmen aboard.<br> And if they are real, captain? We'll use this as a base.<br> It's defensible.<br> They can't approach without being seen.<br> Are we fighting a defensive war, James? No, we don't have time.<br> But if things do go against us, I want a place to retreat to.<br> What I wanna do now is scout them out, find their weaknesses and attack.<br> - Do you drink whisky? - Occasionally, why? Because you have qualities much like those of another man I admire greatly.<br> - General Grant.<br> - Thank you Thank you.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, we'll need weapons.<br> I believe the ancient Vulcans made something like a boomerang.<br> Yes, captain.<br> And slings and spears.<br> Slings.<br> Mr.<br> President, You used a sling as a boy.<br> Indeed I did.<br> Captain.<br> Logic dictates that we consider another course.<br> We don't have much time, Spock.<br> In my time on Vulcan, we also faced these same alternatives.<br> We'd suffered devastating wars, which nearly destroyed our planet.<br> Another was about to begin.<br> We were torn.<br> But out of our suffering, some of us found the discipline to act.<br> We sent emissaries to our opponents to propose peace.<br> The first were killed.<br> But others followed.<br> Ultimately, we achieved peace, which has lasted since then.<br> Circumstances were different then, Surak.<br> The face of war has never changed, captain.<br> Surely it is more logical to heal than kill.<br> I'm afraid that kind of logic doesn't apply here.<br> That is precisely why we should not fight.<br> My ship is at stake.<br> I will not harm others, captain.<br> His convictions are most profound in this matter, captain.<br> So are mine, Spock.<br> If I believed that there was a peaceful way out of this This risk will be mine alone.<br> If I fail, you'll lose nothing.<br> After all, I'm no warrior.<br> The captain knows that I have fought at his side before and will do so now, if need be.<br> However, I too am a Vulcan, bred to peace.<br> Let him attempt it.<br> - You saw how treacherously they act.<br> - Oh, yes.<br> But perhaps it's our belief in peace that is actually being tested.<br> I have no authority over you.<br> You may do as you think best.<br> Thank you.<br> May you live long and prosper.<br> The weapons, gentlemen.<br> In case he fails.<br> Colonel.<br> No.<br> Let's hear what he has to say.<br> We may find it useful.<br> Stop there, Vulcan.<br> - State your purpose.<br> - I come in peace to propose peace.<br> Are you surrendering? I'm doing what I consider best for all of us.<br> If you choose to regard that as surrender, I accept your definition.<br> One of those peace lovers, colonel.<br> Why are you doing this? Do you speak for the others? No, I speak for myself because I abhor violence.<br> But if you accept the solution I offer, they too will accept it.<br> How can I be sure? I think you're trying to trick me, Vulcan.<br> I think that while you're here talking peace, the others are preparing to attack.<br> No, Colonel.<br> They are at their base, awaiting an answer.<br> How can I believe that? No one talks peace unless he's ready to back it up with war.<br> He talks peace if it is the only way to live.<br> Then tell me, what do you have to gain if we accept? Nothing but the knowledge that I have done what I believe in.<br> Well, what do I get out of it? I fight for gain, Vulcan.<br> What do I gain here? Your life and the lives of the others.<br> You said yourself, colonel, that we have common cause: To survive.<br> Together we can.<br> But not by warring.<br> - Why don't we kill him? - No.<br> He's our means to finish them all.<br> Colonel, surely you accept the logic of this? - What is your answer? - You are very persuasive, Vulcan.<br> I'd like to come out of this with a whole skin.<br> Perhaps I can convince my associates that it would be to their advantage also.<br> Your Surak is a brave man.<br> Men of peace usually are, captain.<br> On Vulcan, he is revered as the father of our civilisation.<br> The father image holds much meaning for us.<br> Do you show emotion, Spock? I deeply respect what he has accomplished.<br> Well, I hope he accomplishes something here, and soon.<br> Surak? Help me, Spock.<br> Spock, help me.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Your friend wants you.<br> He seems to be hurt.<br> Spock.<br> Help me, Spock.<br> Spock.<br> Help me.<br> You can't let him suffer.<br> They're trying to goad us into attacking, captain.<br> They expect us to act rashly.<br> - Yes, I know that.<br> - Help me, Spock.<br> He was aware of what might happen when he went.<br> - I should never have let him go.<br> - You had no choice, captain.<br> You could not have stopped him.<br> - How can you ignore that? - A Vulcan would not cry out so.<br> Whether he's a Vulcan or not, he's in agony.<br> - I am not insensitive to it, captain.<br> - Help me.<br> Spock.<br> But you can just listen to it and do nothing.<br> I can't.<br> Captain, that is what they're waiting for.<br> They're waiting for us to attempt a rescue.<br> I can't just let him stay there.<br> Perhaps we can rescue him, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> I suggest that we do whatever they want.<br> Do what they want, sir? Not the way they want it, however.<br> We must first convince them that they have provoked us to recklessness.<br> James, I do not mean to presume upon your authority.<br> What I propose is that I circle around to their rear, while you two provide a frontal assault.<br> It should be sufficiently violent to cover whatever I do.<br> And what will you do? Why, slip into their camp and free him.<br> - No.<br> - James, James.<br> Remember, I was something of a backwoodsman.<br> I doubt that you could do what I was bred to.<br> - I can't let you risk it, Mr.<br> President.<br> - Well, I am no longer president.<br> - Mr.<br> Spock, any comment? - Help me, Spock.<br> - No, sir.<br> - One matter further, gentlemen.<br> We fight on their level.<br> With trickery, brutality, finality.<br> We match their evil.<br> I know, James.<br> I was reputed to be a gentle man.<br> But I was commander in chief during the four bloodiest years of my country's history.<br> I gave orders that sent at the hands of their brothers.<br> Now, there's no honourable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy.<br> There is nothing good in war except its ending.<br> And you are fighting for the lives of your crew.<br> Your campaign, Mr.<br> President.<br> They should be coming soon.<br> Zora.<br> Kahless.<br> No, wait.<br> - How many did you see? - Two.<br> Zora.<br> Surak.<br> Surak.<br> The others have drawn them away.<br> We will circle around.<br> It was a worthy effort, Surak.<br> Worthy.<br> No need to blame yourself for its failure.<br> Help me, Spock.<br> Help me.<br> Spock.<br> Now can you cry like Lincoln? Help me, Kirk.<br> Help me, Kirk.<br> - Mr.<br> Lincoln.<br> - James, stay back.<br> You are the survivors.<br> The others have run off.<br> It would seem that evil retreats when forcibly confronted.<br> However, you have failed to demonstrate to me any other difference between your philosophies.<br> Your good and your evil use the same methods, achieve the same results.<br> Do you have an explanation? You established the methods and the goals.<br> For you to use as you chose.<br> What did you offer the others? What they wanted most.<br> Power.<br> You offered me the lives of my crew.<br> I perceive.<br> You have won their lives.<br> How many others have you done this to? What gives you the right to hand out life and death? The same right that brought you here.<br> The need to know new things.<br> - We came in peace.<br> - And you may go in peace.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> Is that you, captain? Are you all right? Yes, Mr.<br> Sulu, we're all right.<br> You may beam us aboard.<br> Mr.<br> Scott, report.<br> The ship is functioning normally again, sir, and the restart cycle is in operation.<br> You'd never know anything had been out of order.<br> - I can't fathom it.<br> - Mr.<br> Sulu.<br> We should be on warp power within 30 minutes, sir.<br> - Good.<br> - Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> The deterioration in the shielding has stopped, sir, and is reversing itself.<br> I have no explanation.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Chekov.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Any explanation? Conjecture, captain, rather than explanation.<br> - Well? - It would seem that we were held in the power of creatures able to control matter and to rearrange molecules in whatever fashion was desired.<br> So they were able to create images of Surak and Lincoln after scanning our minds and using their fellow creatures as source matter.<br> They seemed so real.<br> And to me, especially Mr.<br> Lincoln.<br> I feel I actually met Lincoln.<br> Yes.<br> And Surak.<br> Perhaps, in a sense, they were real, captain.<br> Since they were created out of our own thoughts, how could they be anything but what we expected them to be? It was so hard for me to see him die again.<br> I feel I understand what Earth must have gone through to achieve final peace.<br> Captain Kirk, the planet has resumed its normal appearance.<br> There is still so much of their work to be done in the galaxy, Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, break us out of orbit and continue to our next assignment.<br> Aye, aye, sir.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",
    "<div class=\"scrolling-script-container\">\n\n\n                    \t\t\tCaptain's log, stardate 5943.<br>7.<br> We have calculated that Beta Niobe will go nova in approximately three and a half hours.<br> Its only satellite, Sarpeidon, is a Class-M planet, which, at last report, was inhabited by a civilised humanoid species.<br> Now our instruments show that no intelligent life remains on the planet.<br> The power source we detected is in this building, captain.<br> - Any sign of survivors? - No signs of sapient life forms.<br> How can a whole planet full of people just disappear? If they knew that the sun was dying, it could be anything up to mass suicide.<br> Reports deny that they had any space-flight capability.<br> This appears to be an archive or library of some kind.<br> Then we're certainly in the right place to find out what happened, where the inhabitants are, and if there are any left now.<br> - Well, that's fine.<br> Where do we start? - May I help you? I am the librarian.<br> May I be of assistance? - Perhaps you can, Mr? - Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> I confess that I'm a little surprised to see you.<br> I had thought that everyone had long since gone.<br> But the surprise is a pleasant one.<br> After all, a library serves no purpose unless someone is using it.<br> You say everyone is gone.<br> Where'd they go? It depended on the individual, of course.<br> If you wish to trace a specific person, I'm sorry, but that information is confidential.<br> No, no particular person, just people in general.<br> Where did they go? You find it difficult to choose, is that it? Yes, a wide range of alternatives is a mixed blessing.<br> But perhaps I can help.<br> Would you step this way, please? May I help you? You may select from more than 20,000 verisim tapes, several hundred of which have only recently been added to the collection.<br> I'm sure you'll find something here that pleases you.<br> You, sir.<br> What is your particular field of interest? - What about recent history? - Really? That's too bad.<br> We have so little on recent history.<br> There was no demand for it.<br> It doesn't have to be extensive.<br> Just the answers to a few questions.<br> Of course.<br> Reference service is available at the desk.<br> You're very late.<br> Where have you been? You're a very agile man, Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> Just how many of you are there? Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> We came as soon as we knew what was happening.<br> Forgive me, sir.<br> It is my fault.<br> I must have miscalculated.<br> Our readings indicated that there was no one here at all.<br> Of course I know.<br> Everyone on this planet was warned of the coming nova long ago.<br> They followed instructions and are now safe.<br> And you had better do the same.<br> - Did you say they were safe? - Absolutely.<br> Every single one.<br> Where did they go? Wherever they wanted to go, of course.<br> It is strictly up to the individual's choice.<br> I see.<br> And you personally sent all these people on the planet to safety? Yes, yes, yes.<br> They are all gone, except you three.<br> Of course, I had to delegate the simple tasks to my replicas.<br> You are the real one, Mr.<br> Atoz? Of course.<br> I am the real Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> As a matter of fact, he's quite real, Jim.<br> Let us take you with us to a place of safety.<br> No, thank you.<br> I plan to join my wife and family when the time comes.<br> Now, don't be concerned about me.<br> Think of yourselves.<br> I warn you most urgently.<br> Make your escape before it's too late.<br> The library is at your complete service.<br> I will gladly supply you with all reference material to help you.<br> History of the planet is available in every detail.<br> Just choose what interests you the most.<br> The millennium, the century, the date, the moment.<br> The library is your key.<br> It's in the wrong file.<br> Well, make your own selection, but remember you're very late.<br> Yes, we'll choose it as quick as we can.<br> How long till nova? - Three hours, 13 minutes.<br> - This gentleman is not Hey, you, sir.<br> I think you'll find something interesting over here.<br> Now, if these won't do, I can bring you another file.<br> Have you made your selection, sir? Exactly what is it that I'm expected to select? I'm sure I was clear.<br> The period in which you're interested.<br> I see.<br> This is a fascinating machine.<br> What is it? This is the atavachron.<br> Interesting nomenclature.<br> Now, how does it work? May I? Oh, no, sir.<br> No.<br> I must ask you not to touch the controlling mechanism.<br> Return and make your selection.<br> When you have chosen, I will prepare you through the atavachron.<br> Thank you, Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> Spock.<br> Bones.<br> Wait.<br> I haven't prepared you.<br> You must be prepared.<br> - What is this place? - Yes, and where is the captain? You dirty thing.<br> Let go of me.<br> Vile vixen.<br> Come when you are bidden, slave.<br> You need a lesson in how to use your betters.<br> Who's your master? I'm a free man, sir.<br> You're gonna want better manners, free man.<br> Defend yourself.<br> Heating this boulder may provide some temporary heat.<br> What's wrong? Something's preventing my phaser from operating.<br> Thank you, man.<br> I thought I'd be limbered sure when that gull caught me cutting his purse.<br> What's that? Are you all right? I took you to be an Anglo, but you're none of us, are you? - You're a bully fine cool for all of that.<br> - Thank you.<br> What a handsome dish you served them, the coxco You better come back with me to the library.<br> You'll be safe there.<br> - Dr.<br> McCoy can see to those bruises.<br> - I'm game, love.<br> Lead and I'll follow.<br> - Where's library? - Right over th Where's the captain, Spock? We were right behind him.<br> What's with you, man? Let's make off before coxcombs come with shoulder clappers.<br> No, no.<br> Come here.<br> Do you remember when you first saw me? Do you remember whether I came through some kind of door? I think the wrong gull must have kicked you in the head.<br> Come on, love.<br> I know a leech who'll ask no questions.<br> No, no.<br> It must be here someplace.<br> - Jim.<br> Jim, can you hear us? - Bones? Spock? Captain, we hear you, but we cannot see you.<br> Are you all right? We must have missed each other somehow.<br> Agreed.<br> Apparently, they have all escaped the destruction of their world by retreating into its past.<br> - Mercy on us.<br> It's spirits.<br> - No, no, no.<br> These are friends of mine.<br> They're - Spock, are you in the library? - Indeed not.<br> We're in a wilderness of arctic characteristics.<br> - He means it's cold.<br> - Can you get back to the library? There is no library, captain.<br> At least not that we can see.<br> We are at the base of an ice cliff.<br> Explain.<br> Just before you disappeared, captain, I discovered a machine which Mr.<br> Atoz called the atavachron.<br> It must have been tied into the tape viewer somehow.<br> Opening time portals to the past.<br> You cross through into the period which you were viewing.<br> I was looking over some material about their ice age.<br> And I am here, evidently, because I stepped through at the same instant as Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Yes.<br> My friends are coming back with reinforcements.<br> There's the mort's accomplice.<br> Arrest him.<br> We are the law and do require that you yield to us.<br> - On what charge? - Thievery and purse cutting.<br> - That is a mistake.<br> I'm no thief.<br> - What's happening? - Lord, help us.<br> What's that? - It's spirits.<br> Away, away, spirit, and let honest men approach.<br> - Keep talking.<br> - Captain.<br> They speak at his bidding.<br> - Stop his mouth, and they'll quiet.<br> - You must be close to the portal.<br> Keep talking now.<br> Jim, what's the matter? - Jim sounded like he was in trouble.<br> - We may be in trouble ourselves.<br> We must find shelter.<br> In this severe cold, we cannot survive much longer.<br> Leave me here, Spock.<br> - We go together or not at all.<br> - Don't be a fool.<br> My hands and face are frostbitten.<br> I can't feel my feet.<br> Alone, you have a chance.<br> Now, do what I say.<br> Go try to find Jim.<br> We go together.<br> You stubborn, thickheaded Vulcan.<br> Suffering from the severity of your weather.<br> Unfortunately, he is the doctor, not I.<br> I'll avoid giving him any medication at this time.<br> Perhaps if he's kept quiet and warm, he may recover naturally.<br> It is agreeably warm here.<br> What are you called? I'm called Spock.<br> Even your name is strange.<br> Forgive me.<br> I've never seen anyone who looks like you.<br> Why are you here? Are you prisoners too? Prisoners? This is one of the places Zor Khan sends people when he wants them to disappear.<br> Didn't you come in through the time portal? Yes, we came through the time portal, but not as prisoners.<br> We were sent here by mistake.<br> The atavachron is far away, but I think you come from someplace farther than that.<br> That is true.<br> I am not from the world you know at all.<br> My home is a planet millions of light-years away.<br> How wonderful.<br> I've always loved books about such possibilities.<br> But they are only stories.<br> This isn't real.<br> I must be imagining all this.<br> I'm going mad.<br> Listen to me.<br> I am firmly convinced that I do exist.<br> I am substantial.<br> You are not imagining this.<br> I've been here for so long.<br> Alone.<br> When I saw you out there, I couldn't believe it.<br> Is he dying? Here.<br> There's the mort.<br> And there's the mort's henchman.<br> Open up.<br> Rouse him.<br> You are the thief who talks to spirits.<br> No.<br> I'm a stranger.<br> Where are you from? - An island.<br> - What is this island? It's called Earth.<br> I know no island Earth.<br> No matter.<br> Continue.<br> I never saw that woman before tonight.<br> When she screamed, as far as I could tell, she was being attacked.<br> Then you deny being her accomplice? Yes, I deny it.<br> I was reading in the library when I heard her scream.<br> My lord, the library.<br> Do you remember where the library is, my lord? Perhaps your part in this is innocent.<br> - I believe you to be an honest man.<br> - He's a witch.<br> Take care, woman.<br> I'm convinced of your guilt.<br> Do not compound it with false accusation.<br> He speaks to unseen spirits.<br> He's a witch.<br> - You heard the voices.<br> - It's truth, my lord.<br> I heard the spirit talk to him.<br> He answered and did call it Bones.<br> You're a witch.<br> He cast a spell.<br> He made me steal against my wish.<br> Surely you don't believe - You heard these spirits? - Aye, my lord.<br> I'll witness to it.<br> What he heard, my lord, were only my friends behind the wall, in the library.<br> In the library.<br> - I know nothing of this.<br> - The library.<br> Send for someone learned in witchcraft, and let him examine him.<br> I will have nothing to do with him.<br> My lord.<br> At least arrange for me to meet Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> - I know no Atoz.<br> - Yes.<br> - Yes, Atoz.<br> - I know nothing of this.<br> Nothing of these matters.<br> - I will not hear him.<br> - Let me speak to you! I will not hear him! At least let me talk to you.<br> Witch.<br> Witch.<br> Witch.<br> They'll burn you.<br> McCoy.<br> McCoy, wake up.<br> - Who are you? - My name is Zarabeth.<br> Zarabeth.<br> Spock, are we in the library? No, we are still in the ice age, but safe for the moment.<br> Jim.<br> - What about Jim? - You're in no condition to get up.<br> You lie down and rest.<br> I shall attempt to find the captain.<br> Well, you find him, Spock.<br> Don't you worry about me.<br> You just find him.<br> Spock.<br> Who is this Jim? He's our commanding officer.<br> And our friend.<br> I saw only the two of you.<br> I did not know there was another.<br> He did not come with us.<br> He was sent through the time portal to another period in history much later than this one.<br> If I am to find him, there's only one possible avenue.<br> Zarabeth, will you show me where the time portal is? But your friend.<br> He is ill.<br> That is true.<br> If I leave him, there's a chance he may never regain the ship.<br> He would then be marooned in this time period, but he is no longer in danger of death.<br> So my primary duty to him has been discharged.<br> And if I remain here, no one of our party would be able to aid Captain Kirk.<br> - You make it sound like an equation.<br> - Well, it should be an equation.<br> I should be able to resolve this problem logically.<br> Perhaps it has something to do with the atavachron.<br> If only I knew more about how it worked.<br> Zarabeth.<br> You said that you were brought here as a prisoner.<br> - May I ask? - Why? My crime was in choosing my kinsmen unwisely.<br> Two of them were involved in a conspiracy to kill Zor Khan.<br> I remember that name from the history tapes in the library.<br> Zor Kahn the tyrant.<br> It was not enough that he execute my kinsmen.<br> Zor Kahn determined to destroy our entire family.<br> He used the atavachron to send us places no one could ever find us.<br> Zarabeth, we must return to Mr.<br> Atoz and the atavachron.<br> We will carry Dr.<br> McCoy, and you must come with us.<br> I will send you and the doctor to the ship, and I shall search for Captain Kirk.<br> I can't go through the portal again.<br> If I do, I will die.<br> You cannot go back? None of us can go back.<br> When we come through the portal, we are changed by the atavachron.<br> That is its function.<br> Our basic cell structure is adjusted to the time we enter.<br> You can't go back.<br> If you go through the portal again, you will die by the time you reach the other side.<br> Spock.<br> Where are we? You are safe here, McCoy.<br> Yes, I remember you.<br> Come, doctor.<br> Back to bed.<br> Why are you still here, Spock? Why aren't you looking for Jim? It is impossible to look for him, doctor.<br> We cannot go back.<br> What do you mean, impossible? We've gotta get back.<br> Zarabeth explained it to me.<br> When we came through the time portal, it altered our physiological structure.<br> If we attempt to return to the library, we shall die.<br> Are you trying to tell me that we're trapped here? Yes, doctor.<br> We are trapped.<br> Just as Jim is trapped wherever he is.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5943.<br>9.<br> The people of this time believe in witches, and witchcraft is what I've been accused of.<br> Five witnesses heard McCoy's voice speak to me and thought it was an evil spirit.<br> From what I know of witchcraft trials, I don't have much chance unless I can get to the prosecutor.<br> No supper for you, love.<br> Come on.<br> Up you go.<br> Give me your cup.<br> Cry out, and I'll break it.<br> Don't move.<br> Jailor.<br> Jailor.<br> I'm being falsely accused.<br> You know that.<br> You will come with me before the inquisitional tribunal, and there the matter of your witchcraft will be decided.<br> - There are no such things as witches.<br> - Jailor.<br> That is sacrilege.<br> If they hear you, they will burn you for such beliefs.<br> You're the only one that can hear me, and that's the truth.<br> There are no witches.<br> Why do you deny it? Do not let them hear you.<br> There are witches.<br> There are.<br> You yourself may be discovered to be a witch by the inquisitor.<br> No.<br> What are you doing? No.<br> Help.<br> I'll denounce you to the inquisitor.<br> You came here from the future, just as I did.<br> - Therefore, you too are a witch.<br> - I beg you, do not implicate me.<br> - They would burn me.<br> - Then help me.<br> I will do everything I can to prove you innocent.<br> I will disprove all the charges of witchcraft.<br> But you must never again speak to the comrades you left behind.<br> Help me return to the library.<br> I've lost my way.<br> I must get back there.<br> - You cannot get back.<br> - I tell you I must.<br> I had two friends with me who are lost in another time period.<br> I must find them.<br> You'll come back with us.<br> We can never go back.<br> We must live out our lives here in the past.<br> The atavachron has prepared our cell structure and our brain patterns to make life natural here.<br> To return to the future would mean instant death.<br> Prepare? I was not prepared.<br> Your Mr.<br> Atoz did not prepare me in any way.<br> Then you must get back at once.<br> If you were not transformed, you can only survive for a few hours here in the past.<br> Come.<br> Hurry.<br> Hurry.<br> Zarabeth, you are a beautiful cook.<br> - Have you ever been told that? - Not recently.<br> Oh, well, you'll find that Spock is quite delinquent in those matters.<br> I hadn't noticed it.<br> Well, now that I'm feeling better, you'll notice a distinct difference in our approach.<br> Really? It's something to look forward to.<br> I think you must be well enough, doctor, to try the few delicacies this climate has to offer.<br> No, not yet.<br> At your rate of progress, it will be soon, I can see.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy is making excellent progress.<br> And Mr.<br> Spock has been practising medicine without a licence, now.<br> Don't let him doctor you.<br> I'm the doctor around here.<br> And known as the worst patient in the entire crew of the Enterprise.<br> I wonder where she is.<br> Five thousand years in the future.<br> Thank you.<br> I wonder where Jim is.<br> Who knows? We can only hope that he is well, wherever he is.<br> What do you mean, we can only hope? Haven't you done anything about it? What was there to do? You could locate the portal.<br> It can't be too far.<br> We've been through all that, doctor.<br> What's the point of rehashing that subject? We can't get back.<br> Wasn't that clear to you? Yes, that was clear to me.<br> Then perhaps you are too ill to understand what \"can't get back\" means.<br> I don't believe it, Spock.<br> It's just not like you to give up trying.<br> Then I'll repeat it for you.<br> Get this through your head.<br> We can't get back.<br> That means we are trapped here, in this planet's past, just as we are.<br> And we'll stay here for the rest of our lives.<br> Now do you understand? Yes, I understand.<br> I never thought I'd hear it, but I understand.<br> You wanna stay here.<br> As a matter of fact, you are highly motivated to stay in this forsaken waste.<br> The prospect appeared quite attractive to you a moment ago.<br> Now, you listen to me, you pointed-eared Vulcan I don't like that.<br> I don't think I ever did, and now I'm sure.<br> What's happening to you, Spock? Nothing that shouldn't have happened long ago.<br> Long ago.<br> Of course.<br> Long ago.<br> This is where it is.<br> I can't remember the exact spot.<br> That's it.<br> That is the portal.<br> I cannot wait any longer.<br> Spock? McCoy? - Kirk to Enterprise.<br> Come in.<br> - Scott here, captain.<br> How much time before the sun blows up? Seventeen minutes.<br> You three had better come back right away.<br> We can't, Scotty.<br> Spock and McCoy are missing.<br> I knew there was trouble.<br> I got a landing party standing by.<br> No.<br> Under no circumstances send anyone else down here without my orders.<br> Prepare to warp out and stand by.<br> Kirk out.<br> Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> Where are you? May I help you? It's you.<br> You're lucky you found your way back here.<br> Now, let me process you through the atavachron.<br> No.<br> Mr.<br> Atoz, my friends and I are from another planet.<br> We don't belong in your history.<br> We don't belong on your planet at all.<br> Just let me take care of you and get you back where you belong.<br> No.<br> I want to find the exact disc that they were viewing.<br> - Please, go back.<br> - I'm sorry, Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> - Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> - Please.<br> I must prepare to escape.<br> I'll let you out in a minute.<br> Still up to your little game of replicas? Which are you this time, real or not? You are evidently a suicidal maniac.<br> I don't understand what you're trying to do, but if you continue, both of us will die, and I, for one, do not wish death.<br> If you help me, we won't die, I promise you that.<br> - I don't trust you.<br> - Are you the replica or the real one? I am the real Atoz.<br> You've done away with my replicas.<br> I regret what I must now do.<br> You don't really wanna hurt me, do you? You've been trying to save my life, I realise that.<br> Put that thing away.<br> I cannot pretend to be sorry that you are here, though I realise it is a misfortune for you.<br> I'm here against my will too, just as you are.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I know of no way to return you to your own time.<br> It's not that I wish to return.<br> This is my time now.<br> I've had to face that, but it has been lonely here.<br> Do you know what it's like to be alone? Really alone? Yes.<br> I know what it is like.<br> I believe you do.<br> Have something to eat, please.<br> If it pleases you.<br> This is animal flesh? Well, there's not much else to eat around here, I'm afraid.<br> Naturally, because of the climate.<br> What is the source of heat in this shelter? There's an underground hot spring.<br> Excellent.<br> Then it will be possible to build a greenhouse of sorts.<br> Meanwhile, this will have to do as the only source of nourishment.<br> There aren't many luxuries around here.<br> Zor Kahn only left me what was necessary to survive.<br> But he evidently intended that you continue living.<br> Yes.<br> He gave me weapons, a shelter, food, everything I needed to live.<br> Except companionship.<br> He did not want it said that he had me killed.<br> But to send me here alone, if that is not death, what is? A very inventive mind, that man.<br> But insensitive, to send such a beautiful woman into exile.<br> The cold must have affected me more than I realised.<br> Please, pay no attention.<br> I'm not myself.<br> I'm behaving disgracefully.<br> I have eaten animal flesh and I've enjoyed it.<br> What is wrong with me? I tell you you're beautiful.<br> But you are beautiful.<br> Is it so wrong to tell you so? I have longed to hear you say it.<br> You are beautiful.<br> More beautiful than any dream of beauty I've ever known.<br> Just stay where you are, sir.<br> I'll see you get to safety.<br> Now, you're gonna help me look for my friends.<br> You're a most determined man.<br> - Kirk here.<br> - What's happening? - Why are you waiting? - No time to explain.<br> - Are you ready to warp out? - Aye, captain.<br> Stand by to beam us up.<br> But when that star explodes, don't wait.<br> Get out fast.<br> Kirk out.<br> Now we're gonna start looking.<br> They were in a frozen waste.<br> I could hear the wind.<br> All right.<br> All right.<br> It must be the Sarpeidon ice age, We'll both look, Mr.<br> Atoz.<br> Spock.<br> You've been dishonest with me, Spock, and that is also something new for you.<br> - I've given you the facts, doctor.<br> - The facts as you know them.<br> Or did you just accept Zarabeth's word because it's what you wanted to believe? You were told the truth.<br> If Zarabeth is the source, what difference does it make? Zarabeth is a woman condemned to a terrible life of loneliness.<br> She would do anything to anybody to change that.<br> - Wouldn't you, Zarabeth? - I told you what I know.<br> Did you? You said we can't get back.<br> The truth is you can't get back.<br> She would not jeopardise other lives.<br> She would do anything to prevent that life of loneliness.<br> She would lie.<br> She would cheat.<br> She would even murder me, the captain, the entire crew of the Enterprise, to keep you here with her.<br> Go ahead, Zarabeth.<br> Tell Spock the truth.<br> Go ahead.<br> Tell Spock you would kill.<br> - What are you doing to her? - Don't let him touch me.<br> Are you trying to kill me, Spock? Is that what you really want? Think.<br> What are you feeling? Rage? Jealousy? Have you ever had those feelings before? This is impossible.<br> Impossible.<br> I am a Vulcan.<br> The Vulcan you knew won't exist for another 5,000 years.<br> Think, man.<br> What's happening on your planet right now at this very moment? My ancestors are barbarians.<br> Warlike barbarians.<br> Who nearly killed themselves off with their own passions.<br> Spock.<br> You're reverting into your ancestors, I've lost myself.<br> I do not know who I am.<br> Can we go back? I don't know.<br> I only know that I can't go back.<br> I know I'm going to try, Spock, because my life is back there.<br> And I want that life.<br> - You think that's the right one? - I don't know.<br> If we're to get the portal set for the proper time period, you must be specific.<br> - I didn't see it.<br> - Well, try calling out.<br> Bones.<br> Spock.<br> McCoy.<br> - You've got the wrong one.<br> - Please, there's no time left.<br> - Let me go.<br> - Try again.<br> There's no portal, here, doctor.<br> - It's hopeless.<br> - I suppose you're right.<br> You're too ill to remain out here any longer.<br> Give it up.<br> Bones.<br> Spock.<br> It's Jim.<br> Here we are, Jim.<br> We found them.<br> - Can you still hear me? - We hear you perfectly, captain.<br> Follow my voice.<br> Spock, McCoy, follow my voice.<br> Do you hear me? Keep following my voice.<br> Spock.<br> McCoy.<br> This must be it.<br> What are you waiting for? Hurry.<br> Come on, Spock.<br> You start ahead, doctor.<br> I do not wish to part from you.<br> I cannot come.<br> If I go back, I will die.<br> What are you waiting for? How much time do we have? - Scotty, how much time is there? - You've got to come aboard now.<br> Come on, Spock, now.<br> Something's wrong.<br> - Why can't he get through? - I don't know.<br> Unless it's because they originally went through the portal together.<br> Spock, McCoy, you can't get through unless you both come back at the same time.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Orders or no, I'm beaming you up.<br> No.<br> Wait.<br> Spock, McCoy, hurry through the portal.<br> Time is running out.<br> He had his escape planned.<br> I'm glad he made it.<br> Kirk to Enterprise.<br> There's no further need to observe me, doctor.<br> As you can see, I've returned to the present in every sense.<br> But it did happen, Spock.<br> Yes, it happened.<br> But that was 5,000 years ago.<br> And she is dead now.<br> Dead and buried.<br> Long ago.<br> - Scotty, are you there? - It's now or never, captain.<br> Beam us aboard.<br> And go to maximum warp as soon as we're there.<br> Kirk out.<br>   <br>\n                </div>",

Nothing I've ever encountered.<br> Janice.<br> You must remain absolutely quiet.<br> Those are doctor's orders, not mine.<br> Captain, tricorder picking up very faint life readings, approximately 700 metres from here.<br> Help will have to be immediate.<br> Perhaps your presence will quiet her.<br> I hoped I wouldn't see you again.<br> I don't blame you.<br> The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my life I was alive.<br> I never stopped you from going on with your space work.<br> Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women.<br> - It isn't fair.<br> - No, it isn't.<br> And you punished and tortured me because of it.<br> I loved you.<br> We could have roamed among the stars.<br> We'd have killed each other.<br> It might have been better.<br> Space, the final frontier.<br> These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.<br> Its five-year mission: To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilisations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br> You had your chance, Captain Kirk.<br> You should have smothered the life in me.<br> Then they would have said, \"Dr.<br> Janice Lester.<br> Died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty.<br>\" Why didn't you do it? You've always wanted to, didn't you? You had the strength to do it.<br> But you were afraid.<br> You were always afraid.<br> Now, Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk.<br> I already possess your physical strength.<br> Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill.<br> Now you know the indignity of being a woman.<br> For you, this agony will soon pass as it has for me.<br> Quiet.<br> Quiet! Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman.<br> It's better to be dead.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy? Your report.<br> We were too late, Jim.<br> There's nothing could be done.<br> Was it radiation as suggested? No, I believe it was celebium.<br> However, Dr.<br> Coleman disagrees.<br> To be specific is essential because the treatment of celebium is quite Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Did you notice any unusual symptoms while we were gone? No, nothing at all.<br> She was unconscious all the time.<br> Dr.<br> Lester is near death.<br> Perhaps the shock of knowing what happened to her staff is part of the problem.<br> I'm sure it is.<br> Beaming her up to the Enterprise would be less harmful than waiting.<br> I don't know.<br> I'm not sure.<br> Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.<br> Captain Kirk to the Enterprise.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott, sir.<br> - Mr.<br> Scott.<br> Prepare to beam the landing party aboard.<br> Plus two others, one critically ill.<br> Have a medical team standing by to receive the patient.<br> Captain Kirk out.<br> Prepare to beam aboard.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman, accompany the patient to the Sickbay.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, take the ship out of orbit.<br> Resume designated course.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, you and Dr.<br> Coleman seem to disagree on diagnosis.<br> No, not entirely.<br> We both agree it's radiation.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman isn't prepared to say what form of radiation.<br> Will it affect your arriving at a correct treatment? It's crucial.<br> Well, this is especially disturbing to me for personal reasons.<br> Oh, I didn't know you knew her that well.<br> Oh, yes.<br> It's been a long time since I saw her.<br> I walked out on her when it became serious.<br> Wow, you must have been very young at the time, Jim.<br> Youth doesn't excuse everything, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> It's a very unhappy memory for me.<br> I didn't realise that.<br> I shall do everything in my power.<br> Thank you.<br> Thank you very much.<br> Dr.<br> Lester is certainly a very lucky young person - to have escaped.<br> - Yes, very lucky.<br> Very lucky.<br> - Just began.<br> - Well, you better put a stop to it.<br> If you allow Dr.<br> Lester to become fully conscious, she'll know what has happened.<br> Probably no one will believe it.<br> - Probably? - That's all we can ask for.<br> How can death be explained now? I tell you, it can't continue.<br> You killed every one of the staff.<br> You sent them where you knew the celebium shielding was weak.<br> Now, why didn't you kill him? You had the perfect opportunity.<br> There wasn't enough time.<br> I gave you every minute you asked for.<br> He hung on to life too hard.<br> I couldn't You couldn't because you love him.<br> You want me to be his murderer.<br> Love him? I loved the life he led.<br> The power of a starship commander.<br> It's my life now.<br> I won't become a murderer.<br> You are a murderer.<br> You knew it was celebium.<br> You could have treated them for it.<br> You're a murderer many times over.<br> Jim, what are you doing here? I thought my presence might quiet Dr.<br> Lester.<br> - It seems to have the opposite effect.<br> - It has nothing to do with you.<br> It's a symptom of the developing radiation illness.<br> Tests with the ship's equipment shows no signs of internal radiation damage, Dr.<br> Coleman.<br> Didn't Dr.<br> Lester's staff become delirious before they went off and died? Well, yes, captain.<br> Yes.<br> Dr.<br> Lester could be suffering from a phaser stun as far as the symptoms I can detect, Jim.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy has had a great deal of experience with radiation exposure onboard the Enterprise.<br> I am guided by his opinion.<br> Dr.<br> Lester and her staff have been under my supervision for two years now.<br> If you don't follow my recommendations, responsibility for her health or her death will be yours.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, I am sorry, but I'm gonna have to take you off the case and turn it over to Dr.<br> Coleman.<br> You can't do this.<br> On this ship, my medical authority is final.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman wants to assume the full responsibility.<br> Let him do it.<br> - I won't allow it.<br> - It's done.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman, your patient.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman, didn't you suggest a sedation to rest the patient? - Yes, captain.<br> - It's not necessary, Jim.<br> Can't you see she's coming around? - Dr.<br> Coleman? - Nurse, administer the sedative.<br> A sedative is not wise at this time, captain.<br> Nurse Chapel, you have your orders.<br> Nurse Chapel, follow your instructions.<br> Am I really losing command of the Enterprise? No.<br> Oh, no, bad dream.<br> Bad dream.<br> James Kirk is returning to consciousness in the body of Janice Lester.<br> The Enterprise is proceeding to its next mission on the course set for it before I took over command.<br> Now the years I spent studying every single detail of the ship's operation will be tested.<br> With a little experience, I will be invulnerable to suspicion.<br> At last I attained what is my just due: Command of a starship.<br> All the months of preparation now come to fruition.<br> - Course, Mr.<br> Chekov? - 127 mark 8.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, set speed at warp factor 2.<br> Warp factor 2, sir.<br> Half to phase.<br> Engineering to Bridge.<br> All conditions green.<br> Full scan Bridge, green.<br> Engineering control.<br> Deck scanner, red to green.<br> Environmental control disrupted.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, plot a course for the Benecia Colony.<br> Direct course to Benecia, How long to the colony at our present speed? Forty-eight hours, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, set course for the colony.<br> - 373 mark 8.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Captain, that will delay our work at Beta Aurigae.<br> - It means reversing course.<br> - Yes, it can't be helped.<br> We must take Dr.<br> Lester to a place where she can be treated.<br> May I point out that Starbase 2 is on the direct route to our destination? How long to Starbase 2? Seventy-two hours, captain.<br> That's 24 hours too long.<br> Dr.<br> Lester's condition is increasingly serious.<br> - Continue present course.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> Sir, if the diagnosis of Dr.<br> Lester's illness is the critical problem, then the Benecia Colony is definitely not the place for her.<br> Their medical facilities are the most primitive.<br> - They will have to serve.<br> - Starbase 2 is fully equipped.<br> And staffed with the necessary specialists to determine exactly what is wrong with the doctor.<br> Is that not crucial to your decision? Thank you, Mr.<br> Spock.<br> But the facilities will be of little use if Dr.<br> Lester's dead.<br> Time is of the essence.<br> Continue present course.<br> At maximum speed, Starbase 2 would still meet the emergency.<br> Captain, shall I advise Starfleet Command of the change of plan? No change of plan has been ordered, lieutenant.<br> Our arrival at Beta Aurigae will merely be delayed.<br> Our gravitational studies of that binary system will not suffer, and a life may be saved.<br> That is not unusual procedure for the Enterprise.<br> Sir.<br> I believe that Starfleet will have to be notified that our rendezvous with the starship Potemkin will not take place as scheduled.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, if you'd concentrate on the areas for which you are responsible, Starfleet Command would have been informed already.<br> Since the captain usually deals directly with Starfleet in these matters, I assumed that my suggestions might be deemed interference.<br> Inform Starfleet of the delay, lieutenant.<br> - Aye, sir.<br> - Continue present course.<br> Increase speed to warp factor 6.<br> I'll let my record speak for me.<br> Why are you being so defensive? There is no implied criticism of you in my order to remove you from the case.<br> That is not the reason I'm here.<br> I'm here because Dr.<br> Coleman's record states that he's incompetent.<br> - That's the opinion of an individual.<br> - No, sir.<br> That is the opinion of Starfleet Command.<br> I checked with them.<br> And Dr.<br> Coleman was removed from his post as chief medical officer of his ship for administrative incompetence.<br> There are no administrative duties required here.<br> As well as flagrant medical blunders.<br> Promotions and demotions can be politically manoeuvred.<br> You know that, Bones.<br> Not in Starfleet Headquarters, captain.<br> And certainly not in the surgeon general's office.<br> I'm afraid the order will have to stand.<br> I can only say that Dr.<br> Coleman's experience with what happened on the planet had to be the deciding factor here.<br> I'm sure that you can appreciate that.<br> I appreciate the fact that you had a decision to make.<br> I also find myself in that position now, Jim.<br> And I'm asking you to report for an examination.<br> Why? What do you base that on? Development of emotional instability and erratic mental attitudes since returning from that planet.<br> You'll never make that charge stick.<br> Any fool can see why you're doing this.<br> I'll let Starfleet Command be the judge of my motives.<br> I won't submit to this petty search for revenge.<br> But you will submit to Starfleet regulations.<br> And they state that the ship's surgeon will require a full examination of any crew member that he has doubts about, including the captain.<br> Captain Kirk here.<br> Sulu here, captain.<br> Starfleet Command is requesting additional details on the delay.<br> I'll be right there.<br> Pulse.<br> Pressure.<br> Blood count.<br> All body functions normal.<br> Then why am I here? Dr.<br> McCoy? Dr.<br> McCoy Quiet would be best for you.<br> Where is Dr.<br> McCoy? I am in charge now.<br> Bring Dr.<br> McCoy at once.<br> He is in command of medicine on this ship.<br> He was taken off your case by Captain Kirk.<br> By Captain Kirk? It was done for your own protection, Dr.<br> Lester.<br> I am not Janice Lester.<br> She did this to me.<br> Now, how can I make you understand? Janice has driven herself mad with jealousy, hatred and ambition.<br> Nurse Chapel, bring Mr.<br> Spock and Dr.<br> McCoy to me at once.<br> Now, they must believe I am not Janice Lester.<br> I am imprisoned in her body, but I am not Janice Lester.<br> She is suffering from the delusion of being Captain Kirk.<br> I am not Janice Lester.<br> The paranoia has been developing for the past six months.<br> The radiation seems to have intensified it.<br> She must be kept sedated.<br> Shall I prepare a mild sedative, doctor? Of course.<br> You are insane, Dr.<br> Lester.<br> Captain's log, stardate unknown.<br> I have lost track of time.<br> I am still held captive in a strange body and separated from all my crew.<br> I must have sounded quite mad to you before.<br> What you've been through would have completely broken most of us.<br> Well, I'll be all right now.<br> Could I see your Dr.<br> McCoy? I'm afraid that's against Dr.<br> Coleman's orders.<br> Is a visit by that very kind Mr.<br> Spock to be allowed? Perhaps that can be arranged before we reach the Benecia Colony.<br> The Benecia Colony? But isn't the Enterprise going to rendezvous with the Potemkin at Beta Aurigae? Well, first we have to let you recuperate at Benecia.<br> You'll feel better if you have a little.<br> Well, I'll try.<br> Thank you.<br> Oh, it is good.<br> Thank you.<br> Could I finish it slowly, Nurse Chapel? - Well - I promise I'll be good.<br> Well, I'll be right back.<br> I'm glad you're feeling so much better.<br> These tests should help me pinpoint the cause of Jim's illness.<br> Good.<br> Knowledge of the captain's aberrant behaviour is spreading.<br> The crew is becoming increasingly tense.<br> Yes, well, what worries me most is that Jim seems completely unaware that something is wrong with him.<br> Now, we've got to make him realise that something serious is happening before treatment can even begin.<br> I'm afraid that is a forlorn hope, doctor.<br> The illness appears to be primarily mental.<br> Well, one of us should be able to get to him.<br> I I don't know.<br> I keep looking for an approach, but the speed with which the illness has travelled makes it doubly difficult.<br> Perhaps the surgeon general's office should be alerted.<br> You know headquarters, Spock.<br> They're only interested in results of specific tests.<br> So far, all we have to offer are our opinions.<br> Are you sure that the captain will comply with your order in his present state of mind? I'll use my medical authority to enforce it, if necessary.<br> Doctor, we are treading on very thin ground.<br> Actions such as these might be misinterpreted.<br> Well, then so be it.<br> Our responsibility is clear.<br> Whatever happened to the captain on that planet must have taken place in the short space of time that he was alone with Dr.<br> Lester.<br> Perhaps a conversation with her might shed some light.<br> Well, it's worth a try.<br> Why don't you try to get to Dr.<br> Lester while I examine Jim? Well, gentlemen.<br> I'm here, doctor.<br> Spock, Bones, help me.<br> Don't let them lock me away from you.<br> I've got to talk to you.<br> Jim! She might have killed someone.<br> Put her in isolation in her room.<br> Maintain a 24-hour watch.<br> No one, absolutely no one is to talk to her without my permission.<br> Yes, sir.<br> Captain.<br> How is the doctor? She regained consciousness very quickly.<br> Good.<br> I have a few questions to ask her.<br> Did the captain order it, sir? Why should he? They're my questions.<br> Therefore I am ordering it, lieutenant.<br> The captain said that no one is allowed to speak to Dr.<br> Lester.<br> Has such an order ever included his senior officers? No, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, I think the captain meant that a guard should be present.<br> By all means, lieutenant.<br> That's enough.<br> That's enough.<br> Your heart will last forever, captain.<br> How am I otherwise? In the pink, as usual.<br> Liver.<br> Kidney.<br> Blood count.<br> Metabolic rate.<br> Everything.<br> Even your glands.<br> Functioning at their usual normal peak of efficiency.<br> I hope you're as pleased about it as I am.<br> Don't get dressed yet.<br> You said I was in perfect condition.<br> Physically.<br> I don't think another test is necessary.<br> The Robbiani Dermal Optic is crucial.<br> It reveals the basic emotional structure.<br> You had one once before.<br> Now I need another one to compare with that previous test.<br> There should be no change in your dermal optic reactions to the colour wavelengths.<br> Over here, captain.<br> Over here, captain.<br> Complete life-entity transfer with the aid of a mechanical device.<br> Yes, that's what it must have been.<br> To my knowledge, such total transfer has never been accomplished with complete success anywhere in the galaxy.<br> It was accomplished and forgotten long ago on Camus II.<br> I am a living example.<br> That is your claim.<br> As yet, it is unsubstantiated by any external evidence or objective tests.<br> Nevertheless, Spock, it is the truth I'm speaking.<br> Now lower your arms and open your eyes.<br> At this moment, Dr.<br> McCoy is examining the captain for psychological changes.<br> If any facts are uncovered, that would be acceptable evidence.<br> The only kind which is acceptable to Starfleet Command and to the crew of the Enterprise.<br> Spock, when I was caught in the interspace of the Tholian Sector, you risked your life and the Enterprise to get me back.<br> Help me get back now.<br> When the Vians of Minara demanded that we let Bones die, we didn't permit it.<br> That is true.<br> The captain did not.<br> However, those events have been recorded.<br> They could have become known to you.<br> You are closer to the captain than anyone in the universe.<br> You know his thoughts.<br> What does your telepathic mind tell you now? I believe you.<br> However, my belief is not acceptable evidence.<br> Evidence must be factual.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy may be of help.<br> Come with me.<br> I'm sorry, sir, but Dr.<br> Lester cannot leave here.<br> Well, are you satisfied with the results of the test? There is no positive evidence of any disorder.<br> You're asking me to violate the captain's orders.<br> He is not the captain.<br> You're as mad as she is.<br> You're to leave here at once.<br> I follow orders.<br> Certainly, lieutenant.<br> We all must do our duty.<br> Security.<br>.<br>! No hard feelings, Bones.<br> You did your usual thorough good job.<br> Yes, I'm sure everything is gonna be all right.<br> Captain Kirk.<br> Captain Kirk here.<br> Escape attempt by Dr.<br> Lester.<br> Captain Kirk to security.<br> On the double to Dr.<br> Lester's room.<br> Quite all right, ensign.<br> Everything's under control.<br> Phasers.<br> A repetition of your physical violence is not called for, sir.<br> No physical resistance will be offered.<br> Attention, all personnel.<br> First Officer Spock has been placed under arrest.<br> He has conspired with Dr.<br> Lester to take over the ship from your captain.<br> A hearing will be immediately convened to consider the charges and specifications of a general court-martial on the charge of mutiny.<br> Captain's log, stardate 5930.<br>3.<br> The results of Dr.<br> McCoy's examination have given me complete confidence in myself.<br> My fears are past.<br> I shall function freely as the captain.<br> I am the captain of the Enterprise, in fact.<br> Surely you must have more than that to go on.<br> I have stated my evidence.<br> Telepathic communication with the mind of Captain James T.<br> Kirk.<br> Your evidence is completely subjective.<br> We have to have evidence that we can examine out in the open.<br> You had a great deal of evidence, except that of the chief witness.<br> The one who should be the real subject of this investigation is kept locked away and in isolation.<br> Why? Captain? She is dangerously insane.<br> We've seen the evidence.<br> She is dangerous only to your authority, sir.<br> Mr.<br> Spock.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, my authority has been given to me by Starfleet Command.<br> And only that high authority can take it away.<br> The witness, sir.<br> Bring on the witness.<br> Let your officers put the questions.<br> Mr.<br> Nunnely, have Dr.<br> Janice Lester brought here.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> While Mr.<br> Spock was busy with his ambitious plot, what were you doing? Examining you.<br> Oh, yes.<br> You were deeply concerned about my health, emotional and physical, since leaving Camus II.<br> Is that correct? Yes, that's correct.<br> And instead of trying to destroy me, you were searching for ways to help me.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy, for the record, will you tell the court your findings? The captain is in the best of physical condition.<br> His emotional and mental state is comparable to the time that he assumed command of the Enterprise.<br> Thank you, Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Mr.<br> Spock, were you aware of Dr.<br> McCoy's findings? I know them now.<br> And what have you to say now? I am disappointed and deeply concerned that there is no objective evidence to support my position.<br> So far.<br> Dr.<br> Coleman, if you're required here, we'll call you.<br> We certainly appreciate you being here.<br> Everyone is deeply aware that you have been subjected to inordinate emotional stress.<br> We'd hoped to avoid any further stress, but Mr.<br> Spock disagrees.<br> It's his opinion that your testimony is important in determining the merits of his case.<br> And since we are solely interested in arriving at a just decision, I'm going to have to ask you a few more questions.<br> I'll try not to upset you.<br> You claim that That you are Captain James T.<br> Kirk.<br> No.<br> I am not Captain Kirk.<br> That is very apparent.<br> I claim that whatever it is that makes James Kirk a living being special to himself is being held here in this body.<br> However, as I understand it, I am Dr.<br> Janice Lester.<br> That's very clever.<br> But I didn't say it.<br> I said the body of James Kirk is being used by Dr.<br> Janice Lester.<br> A subtlety that somehow escapes me.<br> I assume that this switch was arrived at by mutual agreement.<br> No.<br> It was brought about by a violent attack by Dr.<br> Lester and the use of equipment she discovered on Camus II.<br> Violence, by the lady, perpetrated on Captain Kirk? I ask the assembled personnel to look at Dr.<br> Janice Lester and visualise that historic moment.<br> Can you tell me why Dr.<br> Janice Lester would agree to this ludicrous exchange? Yes.<br> To get the power she craved.<br> To attain a position she doesn't merit by temperament or training.<br> And most of all, she wanted to murder James Kirk, a man who once loved her.<br> But her intense hatred of her own womanhood made life with her impossible.<br> Are you prepared with witnesses? One will do.<br> Sir.<br> There is only one issue here.<br> Is the story of life-entity transfer believable? This crew has been to many places in the galaxy.<br> They've been witness to many strange events.<br> They are trained to know that what seems to be impossible often is possible, given the scientific analysis of the phenomenon.<br> Now, Mr.<br> Spock, have you ever heard of a case such as described by Dr.<br> Janice Lester? Not precisely.<br> No.<br> Assuming that you are correct in your belief, do you expect Starfleet Command to place this? This person in command of the Enterprise? I expect only to reveal the truth.<br> And with the truth revealed that I am not really the captain, and knowing that she would not be allowed to serve as the captain, then you would be the captain! It is inevitable.<br> Spock.<br> Spock, give it up.<br> Return to the Enterprise family.<br> All charges will be dropped.<br> And the madness that temporarily overcame all of us on Camus II will fade and be forgotten.<br> And what will become of Dr.<br> Lester? Dr.<br> Lester will be cared for, always.<br> It is a debt and a responsibility I owe her from the past.<br> No, sir.<br> I shall not withdraw a single charge that I have made.<br> You are not Captain Kirk.<br> You have ruthlessly appropriated his body.<br> But the life entity within you is not that of Captain Kirk.<br> You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.<br> Lieutenant Lisa, play back those last two sentences from Mr.<br> Spock's tirade.<br> You do not belong in charge of the Enterprise and I shall do everything in my power against you.<br> You heard the statements placed into the record by you.<br> - Do you understand the nature of it? - I do.<br> And I stand by it.<br> It is mutiny! Deliberate, vindictive, insane at its base! But mutiny is charged and encouragement to mutiny.<br> Dr.<br> McCoy.<br> Mr.<br> Scott.<br> You heard it.<br> On the basis of these statements, I call for an immediate vote by the powers granted to me as captain of the Enterprise.<br> A recess is declared to be followed by a vote.<br> Yes, sir.<br> An immediate vote before our chief witness can be left to die on some obscure planet with the truth locked away inside of her.<br> Silence.<br> You will be silent! A recess has been declared.<br> There'll be no cross-discussion.<br> When I return, we will vote on the charge of mutiny.<br> The evidence presented here is the only basis of your decision.<br> - Scotty.<br> - Doctor.<br> Doctor, I've seen the captain feverish, sick, drunk, delirious, terrified, overjoyed, boiling mad.<br> But up to now, I have never seen him red-faced with hysteria.<br> I know how I'm going to vote.<br> I've been through this with Spock.<br> He's not being scientific and neither are you.<br> It may not be scientific, but if Mr.<br> Spock thinks it happened, then it must be logical.<br> Don't you think I know that? My tests show there's nothing wrong with the captain.<br> Now, that's the only fact Starfleet's going to be interested in.<br> Headquarters has its problems and we have ours.<br> And right now, the captain of the Enterprise is our problem.<br> They're going to call for the vote in a few minutes.<br> Let me put one last question.<br> Suppose you vote with me in favour of Spock.<br> That means two votes to one and Spock is free.<br> What do you think the captain will do? - I don't know.<br> - You know, all right.<br> It'll stick in his craw.<br> He'll never accept it.<br> We don't know that.<br> I tell you, he won't.<br> Then, doctor, that's the time we move against him.<br> We'll have to take over the ship.<br> We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.<br> Aye.<br> Are you ready for the vote? Yes.<br> I'm ready for the vote.<br> Play the tapes of the conversation in the corridor.<br> Aye, sir.<br> Then is the time we move against him.<br> We'll have to take over the ship.<br> We're talking about mutiny, Scotty.<br> Aye.<br> Are you ready for the vote? That's enough.<br> We know what was said.<br> Enough to convict you of conspiracy with mutineers.<br> And you are so charged.<br> The sentence: Death.<br> Mr.<br> Nunnely? Starfleet expressly forbids the death penalty.<br> All my senior officers turning against me? The death penalty is forbidden.<br> - There's only one exception.<br> - General Order 4.<br> And it has not been violated by any officer on the Enterprise.<br> I am responsible.<br> Execution will be immediate.<br> Go to your posts.<br> Go to your posts.<br> Mr.<br> Nunnely, take them to the brig.<br> Prepare for execution.<br> Go on! The captain really must be going mad if he thinks he can get away with an execution.<br> Captain Kirk wouldn't order an execution even if he were going mad.<br> That cannot be the captain.<br> What difference does it make who he is? Are we going to allow an execution to take place? If security backs him up, how will we fight him? I'll fight them every way and any way I can.<br> Lieutenant Lisa, inform all sectors of my decision.<br> Have each section send a representative to the place of execution on the hangar deck.<br> Mr.<br> Chekov, how far to the Benecia Colony? Coming within scanning range.<br> Plot coordinates for orbit.<br> Mr.<br> Sulu, lock into coordinates as soon as orbit is accomplished.<br> Interment will take place on Benecia.<br> You have received your orders.<br> You will obey my orders or you'll be charged with mutiny! You will obey my orders or Or For a moment, I thought I was up on the Bridge.<br> Perhaps you were.<br> Then it's possible the transference can be broken.<br> Well, if it happens again, I'll fight to stay there.<br> The Bridge is where you belong.<br> To accomplish that, each one of us must be ready to seize any opportunity to break out of here and attack.<br> Arthur.<br> - The transference is weakening.<br> - What happened? For a moment, I found myself back with the prisoners.<br> I will not go back to being Janice Lester.<br> You must help me prevent it.<br> The only way to prevent the transference is by the death of Janice Lester.<br> You must carry out the execution.<br> I can't.<br> I can't.<br> The crew is in mutiny.<br> You must kill her for me.<br> I have done everything else for you.<br> - But I will not murder for you.<br> - Then do it for yourself.<br> If Kirk doesn't die, we'll both be exposed as murderers.<br> Does that give you any choice? The dosage should be doubly lethal.<br> It is.<br> To prevent any further conspiracy, you'll be removed to separate cells.<br> If there's any resistance, you'll be given a sedative until you learn cooperation.<br> Dr.<br> Lester will be first.<br> Follow Dr.<br> Coleman.<br> May I point out, captain.<br>.<br>? Kill him! Kill him! I've lost to the captain.<br> I've lost to James Kirk.<br> I want you dead! I want you dead! I want you dead.<br> I'll never get to be the captain.<br> Never.<br> No, no.<br> You are You are as I loved you.<br> Kill him.<br> Can you do anything for her? I'd like to take care of her.<br> Of course.<br> Come with me.<br> I didn't want to destroy her.<br> I'm sure we all understand that, captain.<br> Her life could have been as rich as any woman's.<br> If only If only.<br>   <br>\n                </div>"
